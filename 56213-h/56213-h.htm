<h2 class='nobreak' id='page_1a'>1. THE LAW UNDER WHICH NAZI ORGANIZATIONS ARE ACCUSED OF BEING CRIMINAL</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>The following argument on the law and policy involved in the
prosecution’s charge that certain Nazi groups and organizations
should be declared criminal, was delivered by Justice Jackson before
the Tribunal on 28 February 1946.</span></p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='noindent'>May it please the Tribunal:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The unconditional surrender of Germany created, for the victors,
novel and difficult problems of law and administration. Since
it is the first such surrender of an entire and modernly organized
society, precedents and past experiences are of little help in
guiding our policy toward the vanquished. The responsibility
implicit in demanding and accepting capitulation of a whole people
must of necessity include a duty to discriminate justly and intelligently
between opposing elements of the population which
bore dissimilar relations to the policies and conduct which led to
the catastrophe. This differentiation is the objective of those
provisions of the Charter which authorize this Tribunal to declare
organizations or groups to be criminal. Understanding of
the problem which the instrument attempts to solve is essential
to its interpretation and application.</p>

<h3>A. <span class='it'>The Problem of the Nazi Organizations.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>One of the sinister peculiarities of German society at the
time of the surrender was that the State itself played only a subordinate
role in the exercise of political power, while the really
drastic controls over German society were organized outside its
nominal government. This was accomplished through an elaborate
network of closely knit and exclusive organizations of selected
volunteers oath-bound to execute, without delay and without question,
the commands of the Nazi leaders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These organizations penetrated the whole German life. The
country was subdivided into little Nazi principalities of about 50
households each, and every such community had its recognized
party leaders, party police, and its undercover party spies. These
were combined into larger units with higher ranking leaders, executioners
and spies. The whole formed a pyramid of power outside
<span class='pageno' title='2' id='Page_2'></span>
the law, with the Fuehrer at its apex, and with the local
party officials as its broad base resting heavily on the German
population. The Nazi despotism, therefore, did not consist of
these individual defendants alone. A thousand little fuehrers
dictated, a thousand imitation Goerings strutted, a thousand
Schirachs incited the youth, a thousand Sauckels worked slaves,
a thousand Streichers and Rosenbergs stirred hate, a thousand
Kaltenbrunners and Franks tortured and killed, a thousand
Schachts and Speers and Funks administered, financed, and supported
the movement. The Nazi movement was an integrated
force in city and county and hamlet. The party power resulting
from this system of organizations first rivaled, and then dominated,
the power of the State itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The primary vice of this web of organizations was that they
were used to transfer the power of coercing men from the government
and the law to the Nazi leaders. Liberty, self-government,
and security of persons and property do not exist except
where the power of coercion is possessed only by the State and is
exercised only in obedience to law. The Nazis, however, set up
a private system of coercion, outside of and immune from law,
with party-controlled concentration camps and firing squads to
administer privately decreed sanctions. Without responsibility
to law and without warrant from any court, they were enabled to
seize property, take away liberty, and even take life itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These organizations had a calculated and decisive part in the
barbaric extremes of the Nazi movement. They served cleverly
to exploit mob psychology and to manipulate the mob. Multiplying
the numbers of persons in a common enterprise tends to diminish
each individual’s sense of moral responsibility and to increase
his sense of security. The Nazi leaders were masters of
this technique. They manipulated these organizations to make
before the German populace impressive exhibitions of numbers
and of power. These were used to incite a mob spirit and then
riotously to gratify the popular hates they had inflamed and the
Germanic ambition they had inflated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These organizations indoctrinated and practiced violence and
terrorism. They provided the systematized, aggressive, and disciplined
execution throughout Germany and the occupied countries
of the whole catalogue of crimes we have proven. The flowering
of the system is represented in the fanatical SS General
Ohlendorf, who told this Tribunal without shame or trace of pity
how he personally directed the putting to death of 90,000 men,
women, and children. No tribunal ever listened to a recital of
<span class='pageno' title='3' id='Page_3'></span>
such wholesale murder as this Tribunal heard from him and from
Wisliceny, a fellow officer of the SS. Their own testimony shows
the responsibility of the SS for the extermination program which
took the lives of five million Jews, a responsibility the organization
welcomed and discharged methodically, remorselessly, and
thoroughly. These crimes are unprecedented ones because of the
shocking numbers of victims. They are even more shocking and
unprecedented because of the large number of persons who united
to perpetrate them. All scruple or conscience of a very large segment
of the German people was committed to Nazi keeping, and
its devotees felt no personal sense of guilt as they went from one
extreme measure to another. On the other hand, they developed
a contest in cruelty and a competition in crime. Ohlendorf from
the witness stand accused other SS commanders, whose killings
exceeded his, of “exaggerating” their figures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There could be no justice and no wisdom in an occupation
policy which imposed upon passive and unorganized and inarticulate
Germans the same burdens as it placed upon those who voluntarily
banded themselves together in these powerful and notorious
gangs. One of the basic requirements, both of justice and of
successful administration of the occupation responsibility of the
victors, is a segregation of these organized elements from the
masses of Germans for separate treatment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seems beyond controversy that to punish a few top leaders
but to leave this web of organized bodies unscotched in the midst
of German postwar society, would be to foster the nucleus of a
new Nazidom. The members are accustomed to an established
chain of centralized command; they have formed a habit and
developed a technique of both secret and open cooperation. They
still nourish a blind devotion to the suspended, but not abandoned,
Nazi program. They will keep alive the hates and ambitions
which generated the orgy of crime we have proved. They
are carriers, from this generation to the next, of the infection
of aggressive and ruthless war. The Tribunal has seen on the
screen how easily an assemblage that ostensibly is only a common
labor force can be in fact a military training unit drilling
with shovels. The next war and the next pogroms will be
hatched in the nests of these organizations as surely as we leave
their membership with its prestige and influence undiminished by
condemnation and punishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The menace of these organizations is the more impressive when
we consider the demoralized state of German society. It will be
years before there can be established in the German State any
political authority that is not inexperienced and provisional. It
<span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'></span>
cannot quickly acquire the stability of a government aided by long
habit of obedience and traditional respect. The intrigue, obstruction,
and possible overthrow, which older and established governments
fear from conspiratorial groups, is a real and present
danger to any stable social order in the Germany of today and of
tomorrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Insofar as the Charter of this Tribunal contemplates a justice
of retribution, it is obvious that it could not overlook these organized
instruments and instigators of past crimes. In opening
this case, I said that the United States does not seek to convict
the whole German people of crime. But it is equally important
that this trial shall not serve to absolve the whole German people
except 22 men in the dock. The wrongs that have been done to
the world by these defendants and their top confederates was not
done by their will or by their strength alone. The success of
their designs was made possible because great numbers of Germans
organized themselves to become the fulcrum and the lever
by which the power of these leaders was extended and magnified.
If this trial fails to condemn these organized confederates for
share of responsibility for this catastrophe, it will be construed
as their exoneration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Charter was not concerned with retributive justice
alone. It manifests a constructive policy influenced by exemplary
and preventive considerations. The primary objective of requiring
that the surrender be unconditional was to clear the way
for reconstruction of German society on such a basis that it will
not again threaten the peace of Europe and of the world. Temporary
measures of the occupation authorities may, by necessity,
have been more arbitrary and applied with less discrimination
than befits a permanent policy. Under existing denazification policy,
no member of the Nazi party or its formations may be employed
in any position, other than ordinary labor, or in any business
enterprise unless he is found to have been only a nominal
Nazi. Persons in certain categories, whose standing in the community
is one of prominence or influence, are required to meet
this standard, and those who do not may be denied further participation
in their businesses or professions. It is mandatory to
remove or exclude from public office, and from positions of importance
in quasi public and private enterprises, persons falling
within approximately 90 specified categories deemed to consist
of either active Nazis, Nazi supporters, or militarists. The property
of such persons is blocked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is recognized by the Control Council, as it was by the framers
of the Charter, that a permanent, long-term program should be
<span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>
based on a more careful and more individual discrimination than
was possible with sweeping temporary measures. There is a
movement now within the Control Council for reconsideration of
its whole denazification policy and procedure. The action of this
Tribunal in declaring, or in failing to declare, the accused organizations
criminal has a vital bearing on future occupation
policy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the intent of the Charter to utilize the hearing
processes of this Tribunal to identify and condemn those Nazi
and militaristic forces that were so organized as to constitute a
continuing menace to the long-term objectives for which our respective
countries have spent the lives of their young men. It is
in the light of this great purpose that we must examine the provisions
of the Charter.</p>

<h3>B. <span class='it'>The Procedure for Condemning Organizations.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>It was obvious that the conventional litigation procedures could
not, without some modification, be adapted to this task. No system
of jurisprudence has yet evolved any satisfactory technique
for handling a great multiplicity of common charges against a
multitude of accused persons. The number of individual defendants
that fairly can be tried in a single proceeding probably
does not greatly exceed the number now in your dock. Moreover,
the number of separate trials in which the same voluminous
evidence as to common plan must be repeated is very limited as a
practical matter. Yet adversary hearing procedures are the best
assurance the law has evolved that decisions will be well considered
and just. The task of the framers of the Charter was to
find a way to overcome these obstacles to practicable and early
decision without sacrificing the fairness implicit in hearings. The
solution prescribed by the Charter is certainly not faultless, but
not one of its critics has ever proposed an alternative that would
not either deprive the individual of any hearing or contemplate
such a multitude of long trials as to be impracticable. In any case,
it is the plan adopted by our respective governments and our duty
here is to make it work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The plan which was adopted in the Charter essentially is a
severance of the general issues which would be common to all
individual trials from the particular issues which would differ
in each trial. The plan is comparable to that employed in certain
wartime legislation of the United States (<span class='it'>Yakus</span> v. <span class='it'>United
States</span>, 321 U. S., 414, 64 Sup. Ct. 660). The general issues are
to be determined with finality in one trial before the International
<span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>
Tribunal. In this trial, every accused organization must be defended
by counsel and must be represented by at least one leading
member, and other individual members may apply to be heard.
Their applications may be granted if the Tribunal thinks justice
requires it. The only issue in this trial concerns the collective
criminality of the organization or group. It is to be adjudicated
by what amounts to be a declaratory judgment. It does not
decree any punishment, either against the organization or against
the individual members.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The only specification as to the effect of this Tribunal’s declaration
that an organization is criminal, is contained in Article 10
of the Charter, which provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In cases where a group or organization is declared criminal
by the Tribunal, the competent national authority of any
Signatory shall have the right to bring individuals to trial
for membership therein before national, military or occupation
courts. In any such case the criminal nature of the
group or organization is considered proved and shall not be
questioned.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Unquestionably, it would be competent for the Charter to have
declared flatly that membership in any of these named organizations
is criminal and should be punished accordingly. If there
had been such an enactment, it would not have been open to an
individual who was being tried for membership in the organization
to contend that the organization was not in fact criminal.
The framers of the Charter, at a time before the evidence adduced
here was available, did not care to find organizations criminal
by fiat. They left that issue to determination after relevant
facts were developed by adversary proceedings. Plainly, the individual
member is better off because of the procedure of the
Charter, which leaves that finding of criminality to this body
after hearings at which the organization must, and the individual
may, be represented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The groups and organizations named in the Indictment are
not “on trial” in the conventional sense of that term. They are
more nearly under investigation as they might be before a grand
jury in Anglo-American practice. Article 9 recognizes a distinction
between <span class='it'>the declaration</span> of a group or organization as
criminal and “<span class='it'>the trial</span> of any individual member thereof.” The
power of the Tribunal to try is confined to “persons,” and the
Charter does not expand that term by definition, as statutes
sometimes do, to include other than natural persons. The groups
or organizations named in the Indictment were not as entities
served with process. The Tribunal is not empowered to impose
<span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span>
any sentence upon them as entities, nor to convict any person
because of membership.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is to be observed that the Charter does not <span class='it'>require</span> subsequent
proceedings against anyone. It provides only that the
competent national authorities “<span class='it'>shall have the right</span> to bring individuals
to trial for membership therein.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Charter is silent as to the form these trials should take.
It was not deemed wise, on the information available when the
Charter was drawn up, that the Charter should regulate subsequent
proceedings. Nor was it necessary to do so. There is a
continuing legislative authority, representing all four signatory
nations, competent to take over where the Charter leaves off.
Legislative supplementation of the Charter is necessary to confer
jurisdiction on local courts, to define procedures, and to prescribe
different penalties for different forms of activity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fear has been expressed, however, that the Charter’s silence
as to future proceedings means that great numbers of members
will be rounded up and automatically punished as a result of a
declaration of an organization to be criminal. It also has been
suggested that this is, or may be, the consequence of Article II,
1(d) of Control Council Act No. 10, which defines as a crime
“membership in categories of a criminal group or organization
declared criminal by the International Military Tribunal.” A
purpose to inflict punishments without a right of hearing cannot
be spelled out of the Charter, and would be offensive to both its
letter and its spirit. And I do not find in Control Council Act No.
10 any inconsistency with the Charter. Of course, to reach all
individual members will require numerous hearings. But they
will involve only narrow issues; many accused will have no answers
to charges if they are clearly stated, and the proceedings
should be expeditious and nontechnical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I think it is clear that before any person is punishable for
membership in a criminal organization, he is entitled to a hearing
on the facts of his case. The Charter does not authorize the
national authorities to punish membership without a hearing—it
gives them only the right to “bring individuals to trial.” That
means what it says. A trial means there is something to try.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to trials of the individual members, the Charter denies only
one of the possible defenses of an accused: he may not relitigate
the question whether the organization itself was a criminal one.
Nothing precludes him from denying that his participation was
voluntary and proving he acted under duress; he may prove that
he was deceived or tricked into membership; he may show that
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>
he had withdrawn; or he may prove that his name on the rolls
is a case of mistaken identity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The membership which the Charter and the Control Council
Act make criminal, of course, implies a genuine membership involving
the volition of the member. The act of affiliation with
the organization must have been intentional and voluntary. Legal
compulsion or illegal duress, actual fraud or trick of which one
is a victim, has never been thought to be the victim’s crime, and
such an unjust result is not to be implied now. The extent of the
member’s knowledge of the criminal character of the organization
is, however, another matter. He may not have known on the
day he joined but may have remained a member after learning
the fact. And he is chargeable not only with what he knew but
with all of which he reasonably was put on notice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are safeguards to assure that this program will be carried
out in good faith. Prosecution under the declaration is discretionary,
and if there were purpose to punish without trial, it
would have been already done without waiting for the declaration.
We think the Tribunal will presume that signatory powers
which have voluntarily submitted to this process will carry it
out faithfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Control Council Act applies only to “categories of membership
declared criminal.” This language recognizes a power
in this Tribunal to limit the effect of its declaration. I do not
think, for reasons I will later state, that this should be construed
or availed of so as to try here any issues as to sub-groups
or sections or individuals, which can be tried later. It should,
I think, be construed to mean, not those limitations which must
be defined by detailed evidence, but limitations of principle such
as those I have outlined as already implied. It does not require
this Tribunal to delve into evidence to condition its judgment,
if it sees fit, to apply only to intentional, voluntary, and knowing
membership. It does not supplant later trials but guides them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It cannot be said that a plan, such as we have here, for the severance
of general issues common to many cases from particular
issues applicable only to individual defendants and for the litigation
of each type of issue in separate Tribunals specially adapted
to their different tasks, is lacking in reasonableness or fair play.
And while it presents unusual procedural difficulties, I do not
think it presents any insurmountable ones.</p>

<h3><span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span>C. <span class='it'>Criteria, Principles, and Precedents for Declaring Collective Criminality.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>The substantive law which governs the inquiry into criminality
of organizations is, in its large outline, old and well settled and
fairly uniform in all systems of law. It is true that we are dealing
with a procedure easy to abuse and one often feared as an
interference with liberty of assembly or as an imposition of “guilt
by association.” It also is true that proceedings against organizations
are closely akin to the conspiracy charge, which is the
great dragnet of the law, rightly watched by courts lest it be
abused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fact is, however, that every form of government has considered
it necessary to treat some organizations as criminal. Not
even the most tolerant of governments can permit the accumulation
of power in private organizations to a point where it rivals,
obstructs, or dominates the government itself. To do so would be
to grant designing men a liberty to destroy liberty. It was the
very complacency and tolerance as well as the impotence of the
Weimar Republic towards the growing organization of Nazi
power, which spelled the death of German freedom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Protection of the citizen’s liberty has required even free governments
to enact laws making criminal those aggregations of
power which threaten to impose their will on unwilling citizens.
Every one of the nations signatory to this Charter has laws making
certain types of organizations criminal. The Ku Klux Klan
in the United States flourished at about the same time as the Nazi
movement in Germany. It appealed to the same hates, practiced
the same extra-legal coercions, and likewise terrorized by weird
nighttime ceremonials. Like the Nazi Party it was composed of
a core of fanatics, but enlisted support of some respectable persons
who knew it was wrong, but thought it was winning. It
eventually provoked a variety of legislative acts directed against
such organizations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Congress of the United States also has enacted legislation
outlawing certain organizations. A recent example is the Act of
June 28, 1940 (c. 439, Title I, Section 2, 54 Stat. 671, 18 USCA
10) which provides in part as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>“(a)</span><p class='listPara'>It shall be unlawful for any person .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
</div>

<div class='blockquote-right95percent'>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>“(3)</span><p class='listPara'>to organize or help to organize any society, group,
or assembly of persons who teach, advocate, or
encourage the overthrow or destruction of any
government in the United States by force or violence;
or to be or become a member of, or affiliate
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>
with, any such society, group, or assembly of persons,
knowing the purposes thereof.”</p>
</div>

</div>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>There is much legislation by States of the American union creating
analogous offenses. An example is to be found in the Act
of California (Statutes 1919, Chapter 188, p. 281) which, after
defining “criminal syndicalism,” provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Section 2. Any person who .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. (4) organizes or assists in
organizing, or is or knowingly becomes a member of, any
organization, society, group or assemblage of persons organized
or assembled to teach or aid and abet criminal syndicalism .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>“Is guilty of a felony and punishable by imprisonment.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Precedents in English law for outlawing organizations and
punishing membership therein are old and consistent with the
Charter. One of the first is the British India Act No. 30, enacted
November 14, 1836. Section 1 provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“It is hereby enacted that whoever shall be proved to have
belonged either before or after the passing of this Act to any
gang of thugs either within or without the territories of the
East India Company shall be punished with imprisonment
for life with hard labour.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Other precedents in English legislation are the Unlawful Societies
Act of 1799 (3 George III, Chapter 79); the Seditious
Meetings Act of 1817 (57 George III, Chapter 19); the Seditious
Meetings Act of 1846 (9 and 10 Victoria, Chapter 33); the Public
Order Act of 1936 and Defense Regulation 18(b). The last, not
without opposition, was intended to protect the integrity of the
British Government against the fifth-column activities of this
same Nazi conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soviet Russia punishes as a crime the formation of and membership
in a criminal gang. Criminologists of the U.S.S.R. call
this crime the “crime of banditry,” a term appropriate to the German
organizations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>French criminal law makes membership in subversive organizations
a crime. Membership of the criminal gang is a crime in
itself. (Articles 265-268, French Penal Code, “<span class='it'>Association de
Malfaiteurs</span>”; Garaud, <span class='it'>Précis de Droit Criminel</span>, 1934 Edition
Sirey, p. 1518 and seq. See also Act of December 18, 1893.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>For German precedents, it is neither seemly nor necessary to
go to the Nazi regime. Under the Empire and the Weimar Republic,
however, German jurisprudence deserved respect and it
presents both statutory and juridical examples of declarations of
the criminality of organizations. Among statutory examples are:
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>1. The German Criminal Code enacted in 1871. Section 128
was aimed against secret associations and Section 129 was directed
against organizations inimical to the State.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. The law of March 22, 1921 against paramilitary organizations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. The law of July 21, 1922 against organizations aimed at
overthrowing the constitution of the Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Section 128 of the Criminal Code of 1871 is especially pertinent.
It reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The participation in an organization the existence, constitution,
or purposes of which are to be kept secret from the
Government, or in which obedience to unknown superiors or
unconditional obedience to known superiors is pledged, is
punishable by imprisonment up to six months for the members
and from one month to one year for the founders and
officers. Public officials may be deprived of the right to hold
public office for a period of from one to five years.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Under the Empire, various Polish national unions were the
subject of criminal prosecution. Under the Republic, judicial
judgments in 1927-28 held criminal the entire Communist Party
of Germany. In 1922 and 1928 judgments ran against the political
Leadership Corps of the Communist Party, which included
all its so-called “body of functionaries,” corresponding to the
Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party which we have accused. The
judgment included every cashier, every employee, every delivery
boy and messenger, and every district leader. In 1930 a judgment
of criminality against the “Union of Red Front Fighters”
of the Communist Party made no discrimination between leaders
and ordinary members.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most significant of all is the fact that on 30 May, 1924 the
German courts rendered judgment that the whole Nazi Party
was a criminal organization. This decision referred not only to
the Leadership Corps, which we are indicting here, but to all
other members as well. The whole subsequent rise to power of
the Nazi Party was in the shadow of this judgment of illegality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German courts in dealing with criminal organizations proceeded
on the theory that all members were held together by a
common plan in which each one participated even though at
various levels. Moreover, the fundamental principles of responsibility
of members as stated by the German Supreme Court are
strikingly like the principles that govern our Anglo-American
law of conspiracy. Among them were these:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>1. “It is a matter of indifference whether all the members
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>
pursued the forbidden aims. It is enough if a part exercised
the forbidden activity.” (R.G. VIa 97/22 of the 8.5.22.)</p>

<p>2. “It is a matter of indifference whether the members of
the group or association agree with the aims, tasks, means
of working and means of fighting.” (R.G. 58, 401 of the
24.10.24.)</p>

<p>3. “The real attitude of mind of the participants is a matter
of indifference. Even if they had the intention of not participating
in criminal efforts, or hindering them, this can
not eliminate their responsibility.” (R.G. 58, 401 of the
24.10.24.)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Organizations with criminal ends are everywhere regarded as
in the nature of criminal conspiracies, and their criminality is
judged by the application of conspiracy principles. The reason
why they are offensive to law-governed people has been succinctly
stated as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The reason for finding criminal liability in case of a combination
to effect an unlawful end or to use unlawful means,
where none would exist, even though the act contemplated
were actually committed by an individual, is that a combination
of persons to commit a wrong, either as an end or as
a means to an end, is so much more dangerous, because of
its increased power to do wrong, because it is more difficult
to guard against and prevent the evil designs of a group of
persons than of a single person, and because of the terror
which fear of such a combination tends to create in the
minds of people.” (<span class='it'>Miller on Criminal Law</span>, 1932, p. 110.)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Charter, in Article 6, provides that “Leaders, organizers,
instigators and accomplices participating in the formulation or
execution of a common plan or conspiracy to commit any of the
foregoing crimes are responsible for all acts performed by any
persons in execution of such plan.” The individual defendants
are arraigned at your bar on this charge which, if proved, makes
them responsible for the acts of others in execution of the common
plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Charter did not define responsibility for the acts of others
in terms of “conspiracy” alone. The crimes were defined in non-technical
but inclusive terms, and embraced formulating and
executing a “common plan” as well as participating in a “conspiracy.”
It was feared that to do otherwise might import into
the proceedings technical requirements and limitations which
have grown up around the term “conspiracy.” There are some
divergences between the Anglo-American concept of conspiracy
and that of either Soviet, French, or German jurisprudence. It
<span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>
was desired that concrete cases be guided by the broader considerations
inherent in the nature of the social problem, rather
than controlled by refinements of any local law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, except for procedural difficulties arising from their multitude,
there is no reason why every member of any Nazi organization
accused here could not have been indicted and convicted
as a part of the conspiracy under Article 6 even if the
Charter had never mentioned organizations at all. Voluntary
affiliation constituted a definite act of adherence to some common
plan and purpose. These did not pretend to be merely social
or cultural groups; admittedly they were united for action. In
the case of several of the Nazi organizations, the fact of confederation
was evidenced by formal induction into membership,
the taking of an oath, the wearing of a distinctive uniform, the
submission to a discipline. That all members of each Nazi organization
did combine under a common plan to achieve some
end by combined efforts is abundantly established.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The criteria for determining the collective guilt of those who
thus adhered to a common plan obviously are those which would
test the legality of any combination or conspiracy. Did it contemplate
illegal methods or aim at illegal ends? If so, the liability
of each member of one of these Nazi organizations for
the acts of every other member is not essentially different from
the liability for conspiracy enforced in Courts of the United
States against business men who combine in violation of the anti-trust
laws, or of other defendants accused under narcotic drugs
laws, sedition acts, or other federal penal enactments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the principles every day enforced in Courts of Great
Britain and the United States in dealing with conspiracy are
these:</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. No meeting or formal agreement is necessary. It is sufficient,
although one performs one part and other persons other
parts, if there be concert of action, and working together understandingly
with a common design to accomplish a common
purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. One may be liable even though he may not have known who
his fellow-conspirators were, or just what part they were to take,
or what acts they committed, and though he did not take personal
part in them or was absent when criminal acts occurred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. There may be liability for acts of fellow-conspirators
although the particular acts were not intended or anticipated, if
they were done in execution of the common plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>4. It is not necessary to liability that one be a member of a
conspiracy at the same time as other actors, or at the time of
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>
criminal acts. When one becomes a party to it, he adopts and
ratifies what has gone before and remains responsible until he
abandons the conspiracy with notice to his fellow-conspirators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, members of criminal organizations or conspiracies
who personally commit crimes are individually punishable for
those crimes exactly as are those who commit the same offenses
without organizational backing. But the very gist of the crime
of conspiracy or membership in a criminal association is liability
for acts one did not personally commit but which his acts facilitated
or abetted. The crime is to combine with others and to
participate in the unlawful common effort, however innocent the
personal acts of the participant when considered by themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The very innocent act of mailing a letter is enough to implicate
one in a conspiracy if the purpose of the letter is to advance a
criminal plan. There are countless examples of this doctrine in
Anglo-American jurisprudence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sweep of the law of conspiracy is an important consideration
in determining the criteria of guilt for organizations. Certainly
the vicarious liability imposed in consequence of voluntary
membership, formalized by oath, dedicated to a common organizational
purpose and submission to a discipline and chain of command,
can not be less than that which follows from informal cooperation
with a nebulous group to a common end as is sufficient
in conspiracy. This meets the suggestion that the prosecution is
required to prove every member, or every part, fraction, or division
of the membership to be guilty of criminal acts. The suggestion
ignores the conspiratorial nature of the charge. Such an
interpretation also would reduce the Charter to an unworkable
absurdity. To concentrate in one International Tribunal inquiries
requiring such detailed evidence as to each member would set a
task not possible of completion within the lives of living men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is easy to toss about such a plausible but superficial cliché as,
“One should be convicted for his activities, not for his membership.”
But this ignores the fact that membership in Nazi bodies
was itself an activity. It was not something passed out to a passive
citizen like a handbill. Even a nominal membership may aid
and abet a movement greatly. Does anyone believe that Hjalmar
Schacht sitting in the front row of the Nazi Party Congress of
1935, wearing the insignia of the Party, was included in the Nazi
propaganda films merely for artistic effect? This great banker’s
mere loan of his name to this shady enterprise gave it a lift and
a respectability in the eyes of every hesitating German. There
may be instances in which membership did not aid and abet the
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>
organizational ends and means, but individual situations of that
kind are for appraisal in the later hearings and not by this Tribunal.
By and large, the use of organization affiliation is a quick
and simple, but at the same time fairly accurate outline of the
contours of a conspiracy to do what the organization actually did.
It is the only one workable at this stage of the trial. It can work
no injustice because before any individual can be punished, he
can submit the facts of his own case to further and more detailed
judicial scrutiny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the Charter does not so provide, we think that on ordinary
legal principles the burden of proof to justify a declaration
of criminality is upon the prosecution. It is discharged, we think,
when we establish the following:</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. The organization or group in question must be some aggregation
of persons associated in some identifiable relationship with
a collective general purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. While the Charter does not so declare, we think it implied
that membership in such an organization must be generally voluntary.
That does not require proof that every member was a
volunteer. Nor does it mean that an organization is not to be
considered voluntary if the defense proves that some minor fraction
or small percentage of its membership was compelled to join.
The test is a common-sense one: Was the organization on the
whole one which persons were free to join or to stay out of?
Membership is not made involuntary by the fact that it was good
business or good politics to identify one’s self with the movement.
Any compulsion must be of the kind which the law normally recognizes,
and threats of political or economic retaliation would be
of no consequence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. The aims of the organization must be criminal in that it was
designing to perform acts denounced as crimes in Article 6 of the
Charter. No other act would authorize conviction of an individual
and therefore no other act would authorize conviction of
an organization in connection with the conviction of the individual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>4. The criminal aims or methods of the organization must have
been of such character that its membership in general may properly
be charged with knowledge of them. This again is not specifically
required by the Charter. Of course, it is not incumbent
on the prosecution to establish the individual knowledge of every
member of the organization or to rebut the possibility that some
may have joined in ignorance of its true character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>5. Some individual defendant must have been a member of the
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>
organization and must be convicted of some act on the basis of
which the organization is declared to be criminal.</p>

<h3>D. <span class='it'>Definition of Issues for Trial.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>The progress of this trial will be expedited by clear definition
of the issues to be tried. I have indicated what we consider to be
the proper criteria of guilt. There are also subjects which we
think are not relevant before this Tribunal, some of which are
mentioned in the specific questions asked by the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only a single ultimate issue is before this Tribunal for decision.
That is whether accused organizations properly may be characterized
as criminal ones or as innocent ones. Nothing is relevant
here that does not bear on a question that would be common to
the case of every member. Any matter which would be exculpating
for some members but not for all is irrelevant here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We think it is not relevant to this proceeding at this stage that
one or many members were conscripted if in general the membership
was voluntary. It may be conceded that conscription is a
good defense for an individual charged with membership in a
criminal organization, but an organization can have criminal purposes
and commit criminal acts even if a portion of its membership
consists of persons who were compelled to join it. The issue
of conscription is not pertinent to this proceeding but it is pertinent
to the trials of individuals for membership in organizations
declared criminal by this Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We also think it is not relevant to this proceeding that one or
more members of the named organizations were ignorant of its
criminal purposes or methods if its purposes or methods were open
and notorious. An organization may have criminal purposes and
commit criminal acts although one or many of its members were
without personal knowledge thereof. If a person joined what he
thought was a social club but what in fact was a gang of cutthroats
and murderers, his lack of knowledge would not exonerate the
gang considered as a group, although it might possibly be a factor
in extenuation of a charge of criminality brought against him for
mere membership in the organization. Even then the test would
be not what the man knew, but what, as a person of common understanding,
he should have known.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not relevant to this proceeding that one or more members
of the named organizations were themselves innocent of unlawful
acts. This proposition is basic to the entire theory of the
declaration of organizational criminality. The purpose of declaring
criminality of organizations, as in every conspiracy charge,
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>
is punishment for aiding crimes, although the precise perpetrators
may never be found or identified. We know that the Gestapo
and SS, as organizations, were given principal responsibility
for the extermination of the Jewish people in Europe—but beyond
a few isolated instances, we can never establish which
members of the Gestapo or SS actually carried out the murders.
Any member guilty of direct participation in such crimes can be
tried on the charge of having committed specific crimes in addition
to the general charge of membership in a criminal organization.
Therefore, it is wholly immaterial that one or more members
of the organizations were themselves allegedly innocent of
specific wrongdoing. The purpose of this proceeding is not to
reach instances of individual criminal conduct, even in subsequent
trials and, therefore, such considerations are irrelevant
here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another question raised by the Tribunal is the period of time
during which the groups or organizations named in the Indictment
are claimed by the Prosecution to have been criminal. The Prosecution
believes that each organization should be declared criminal
during the period referred to in the Indictment. We do not contend
that the Tribunal is without power to condition its declaration
so as to cover a lesser period of time than that set forth in
the Indictment. The Prosecution feels, however, that there is in
the record at this time adequate evidence to support the charge
of criminality with respect to each of the named organizations
during the full period of time set forth in the Indictment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another question raised by the Tribunal is whether any classes
of persons included within the accused groups or organizations
should be excluded from the declaration of criminality. It is, of
course, necessary that the Tribunal relate its declaration to some
identifiable group or organization. The Tribunal, however, is not
expected or required to be bound by formalities of organization.
In framing the Charter, the use was deliberately avoided of terms
or concepts which would involve this trial in legal technicalities
about “juristic persons” or “entities.” Systems of jurisprudence
are not uniform in the refinements of these fictions. The concept
of the Charter, therefore, is a nontechnical one. “Group” or “organization”
should be given no artificial or sophistical meaning.
The word “group” was used in the Charter as a broader term,
implying a looser and less formal structure or relationship than is
implied in the “organization.” The terms mean in the context of
the Charter what they mean in the ordinary speech of people. The
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>
test to identify a group or organization is, we submit, a natural
and common-sense one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is important to bear in mind that while the Tribunal no doubt
has power to make its own definition of the groups it will declare
criminal, the precise composition and membership of groups and
organizations is not an issue for trial here. There is no Charter
requirement and no practical need for the Tribunal to define a
group or organization with such particularity that its precise composition
or membership is thereby determined. The creation of a
mechanism for later trial of such issues was a recognition that the
declaration of this Tribunal is not decisive of such questions and
is likely to be so general as to comprehend persons who on more
detailed inquiry will prove to be outside of it. An effort by this
Tribunal to try questions of exculpation of individuals, few or
many, would unduly protract the trial, transgress the limitation
of the Charter, and quite likely do some mischief by attempting to
adjudicate precise boundaries on evidence which is not directed
to that purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prosecution stands upon the language of the Indictment
and contends that each group or organization should be declared
criminal as an entity and that no inquiry should be entered
upon and no evidence entertained as to the exculpation of
any class or classes of persons within such descriptions. Practical
reasons of conserving the Tribunal’s time combine with practical
considerations for the defendants. A single trial held in
one city to deal with questions of excluding thousands of defendants
living all over Germany could not be expected to do
justice to each member unless it was expected to endure indefinitely.
Provision for later, local trial of individual relationships
protects the rights of members better than can possibly
be done in proceedings before this Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With respect to the Gestapo, the United States consents to
exclude persons employed in purely clerical, stenographic, janitorial
or similar unofficial routine tasks. As to the Nazi Leadership
Corps we abide by the position taken at the time of submission
of the evidence, that the following should be included:
the Fuehrer, the <span class='it'>Reichsleitung</span> (i.e., the <span class='it'>Reichsleiters</span>, main departments
and officeholders), the <span class='it'>Gauleiters</span> and their staff
officers, the <span class='it'>Kreisleiters</span> and their staff officers, the <span class='it'>Ortsgruppenleiters</span>,
the <span class='it'>Zellenleiters</span>, and the <span class='it'>Blockleiters</span>, but not members of
the staff of the last three officials. As regards the SA, it is considered
advisable that the Declaration expressly exclude (1) wearers
of the SA Sports Badge; (2) SA controlled Home Guard Units
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>
(<span class='it'>SA Wehrmannschaften</span>) which were not strictly part of the SA;
(3) The <span class='it'>Marchabteilungen</span> of the N.S.K.O.V. (National Socialist
League for Disabled Veterans); and (4) the SA Reserve, so as to
include only the active part of the organization, and that members
who were never in any part of that organization other than the
Reserve should be excluded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution does not feel that there is evidence of the
severability of any class or classes of persons within the organizations
accused which would justify any further concessions
and feels that no other part of the named groups should be excluded.
In this connection, we would again stress the principles
of conspiracy. The fact that a section of an organization itself
committed no criminal act, or may have been occupied in technical
or administrative functions, does not relieve that section of
criminal responsibility if its activities contributed to the accomplishment
of the criminal enterprise.</p>

<h3>E. <span class='it'>Further Steps Before This Tribunal.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Over 45,000 persons have joined in communications to this
Tribunal asking to be heard in connection with the accusations
against organizations. The volume of these applications has
caused apprehension as to further proceedings. No doubt there
are difficulties yet to be overcome, but my study indicates that
the difficulties are greatly exaggerated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal is vested with wide discretion as to whether it
will entertain an application to be heard. The Prosecution
would be anxious, of course, to have every application granted
that is necessary, not only to do justice but to avoid the appearance
of doing anything less than justice. And we do not consider
that expediting this trial is so important as affording a fair
opportunity to present all really pertinent facts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Analysis of the conditions which have brought about this
flood of applications indicates that their significance is not proportionate
to their numbers. The Tribunal sent out 200,000
printed notices of the right to appear before it and defend. They
were sent to Allied prisoner of war and internment camps. The
notice was published in all German language papers and was repeatedly
broadcast over the radio. The 45,000 persons who responded
with applications to be heard came principally from
about 15 prisoner of war and internment camps in British or
United States control. Those received included an approximate
12,000 from Dachau, 10,000 from Langwasser, 7,500 from Auerbach,
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>
4,000 from Staumuehle, 2,500 from Garmisch, and several
hundred from each of the others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We undertook investigation of these applications from Auerbach
camp as probably typical of all. The camp is for prisoners
of war, predominantly SS members, and its prisoners number
16,964 enlisted men and 923 officers. The notice of the International
Tribunal was posted in each barracks and was read to
all inmates. The applications to the Tribunal were forwarded
without censorship. Applications to defend were made by 7,509
SS members.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Investigation indicates that these were filed in direct response
to the notice and that no action was directed or inspired from
any other source within the camp. All who were interrogated
professed no knowledge of any SS crimes or of SS criminal
purpose, but expressed interest only in their individual fate.
Our investigators report no indication that the SS members had
additional evidence or information to submit on the general
question of the criminality of the SS as an organization. They
seemed to think it necessary to make the application to this Tribunal
in order to protect themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Examination of the applications made to the Tribunal indicates
that most members do not profess to have evidence on the
general issue triable here. They assert that the writer has
neither committed, witnessed, nor known of the crimes charged
against the organization. On a proper definition of the issues
such an application is insufficient on its face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A careful examination of the Tribunal’s notice to which these
applications respond will indicate that the notice contains no
word which would inform a member, particularly if a layman,
of the narrowness of the issues here, or of the later opportunity
of each member, if and when prosecuted, to present personal
defenses. On the other hand, I think the notice creates the impression
that every member may be convicted and punished by
this Tribunal and that his only chance to be heard is here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In view of these facts we suggest consideration of the following
program for completion of this trial as to organizations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. That the Tribunal formulate and express in an order the
scope of the issues and the limitations on the issues to be heard
by it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. That a notice adequately informing members as to the
limitation on issues and the opportunity for later, individual
trial, be sent to all applicants and published as was the original
notice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. That a panel of masters be appointed as authorized in
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>
Article 17(e) of the Charter to examine applications and report
those insufficient on their own statements, and to go to the camps
and supervise the taking of any relevant evidence. Defense
counsel and prosecution representatives should of course attend
and be heard before the masters. The masters should reduce
any evidence to deposition form and report the whole to the
Tribunal to be introduced as a part of its record.</p>

<p class='pindent'>4. The representative principle may also be employed to simplify
this task. Members of particular organizations in particular
camps might well be invited to choose one or more to
represent them in presenting evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may not be untimely to remind the Tribunal and defense
counsel that the prosecution has omitted from evidence many
relevant documents which show repetition of crimes by these organizations
in order to save time by avoiding cumulative evidence.
It is not too much to expect that cumulative evidence of a negative
character will likewise be limited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some concern has been expressed as to the number of persons
who might be affected by the declarations of criminality we
have asked. Some people seem more susceptible to the shock of
a million punishments than to the shock of 5 million murders. At
most the number of punishments will never catch up with the
number of crimes. However, it is impossible to state even with
approximate accuracy the number of persons who might be affected.
Figures from German sources seriously exaggerate the
number, because they do not take account of heavy casualties in
the latter part of the war, and make no allowances for duplication
of membership, which was large. For example, the evidence
is to the effect that 75 percent of the Gestapo men also were members
of the SS. We know that the United States forces have in
detention a roughly estimated 130,000 persons who appear to be
members of accused organizations. I have no figures from other
Allied forces. But how many of these actually would be prosecuted,
instead of being dealt with under the denazification program,
no one can foretell. Whatever the number, of one thing
we may be sure: it is so large that a thorough inquiry by this
Tribunal, into each case, would prolong its session beyond endurance.
All questions as to whether individuals or sub-groups
of accused organizations should be excepted from the Declaration
of Criminality, should be left for local courts, located near the
home of the accused and near sources of evidence. These courts
can work in one or at most in two languages, instead of four, and
can hear evidence which both parties direct to the specific issues.</p>

<h3><span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>F. <span class='it'>Conclusion.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>This is not the time to review the evidence against particular
organizations which, we take it, should be reserved for summation
after all the evidence is presented. But it is timely to say that
the selection of the six organizations named in the Indictment was
not a matter of chance. The chief reasons they were chosen are
these: collectively they were the ultimate repositories of all power
in the Nazi regime; they were not only the most powerful, but
the most vicious organizations in the regime; and they were organizations
in which membership was generally voluntary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi Leadership Corps consisted of the directors and principal
executors of the Nazi Party, which was the force lying behind
and dominating the whole German state. The Reichs Cabinet
was the facade through which the Nazi Party translated its will
into legislative, administrative, and executive acts. The two pillars
on which the security of the regime rested were the armed
forces, directed and controlled by the General Staff and High
Command, and the police forces—the Gestapo, the SA, the SD,
and the SS. These organizations exemplify all the evil forces of
the Nazi regime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These organizations were also selected because, while representative,
they were not so large or extensive as to make it
probable that innocent, passive, or indifferent Germans might be
caught up in the same net with the guilty. State officialdom is
represented, but not all administrative officials or department
heads or civil servants; only the <span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span>, the very heart
of Nazidom within the Government, is named. The armed forces
are accused, but not the average soldier or officer, no matter how
high ranking. Only the top policy-makers—the General Staff and
High Command—are named. The police forces are accused, but
not every policeman: not the ordinary police, which performed
only normal police functions. Only the most terroristic and repressive
police elements—the Gestapo and SD—are named. The
Nazi Party is accused, but not every Nazi voter, not even every
member; only the leaders, the <span class='it'>Politische Leiter</span>. (<span class='it'>See Chart No.
14.</span>) And not even every Party official or worker is included; only
“the bearers of sovereignty,” in the metaphysical jargon of the
Party, who were the actual commanding officers and their staff
officers on the highest levels, are accused. The “formations” or
strong arms of the Party are accused, but not every one of the
seven formations, nor any of the twenty or more supervised or affiliated
party groups. Nazi organizations in which membership
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>
was compulsory, either legally or in practice (like the Hitler Youth
and the <span class='it'>Deutsche Studentschaft</span>); Nazi professional organizations
(like the Civil Servants Organization, the National Socialist
Teachers Organization, and the National Socialist Lawyers Organization);
Nazi organizations having some legitimate purpose
(like the welfare organizations), have not been indicted. Only
two formations are named, the SA and the SS, the oldest of the
Nazi organizations, groups which had no purpose other than carrying
out the Nazi schemes and which actively participated in
every crime denounced in the Charter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In administering preventive justice with a view to forestalling
repetition of these crimes against peace, crimes against humanity,
and war crimes, it would be a greater catastrophe to acquit these
organizations than it would be to acquit the entire 22 individual
defendants in the box. These defendants’ power for harm is spent.
That of these organizations goes on. If they are exonerated here,
the German people will infer that they did no wrong and will
easily be regimented in reconstituted organizations under new
names behind the same program.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In administering retributive justice it would be possible to exonerate
these organizations only by concluding that no crimes
have been committed by the Nazi regime. Their sponsorship of
every Nazi purpose and their confederation to execute every measure
to attain those ends is beyond denial. A failure to condemn
these organizations under the terms of the Charter can only mean
that such Nazi ends and means cannot be considered criminal,
and that the Charter of the Tribunal is considered a nullity.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg23a'>2. THE NAZI PARTY LEADERSHIP CORPS</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi Party Leadership Corps—it is proposed to demonstrate—was
responsible for planning, directing, and supervising
the criminal measures carried into execution by the Nazi Party,
which was the central core of the common plan or conspiracy
charged in Count I of the Indictment. Moreover, it will be shown,
the members of the Leadership Corps themselves actively participated
in the commission of illegal measures in aid of the conspiracy.
In the light of the evidence to be discussed, the Leadership
Corps may be fairly described as the brain, the backbone,
and the directing arms of the Nazi Party. Its responsibilities are

<h3><span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>A. <span class='it'>Composition, Functions, Responsibilities, and Powers of the Leadership Corps.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>In considering the composition and organizational structure of
the Leadership Corps, preliminary reference is made to the organization
chart of the Nazi Party (<span class='it'>Chart Number 1</span>) as well as
a chart of the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party appearing at
page 9 of a magazine published by the Chief Education Office of
the Nazi Party entitled “<span class='it'>Das Gesicht der Partei</span>” (The Face of the
Party). These charts and the evidence to follow show that the
Leadership Corps constituted the sum of the officials of the Nazi
Party: it included the Fuehrer; the <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> and Reich office
holders; the five categories of leaders who were area commanders
(called <span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span>, or “bearers of sovereignty”) ranging all
the way from the 40-odd <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> in charge of large districts
down through the intermediate political leaders to the <span class='it'>Blockleiter</span>,
charged with looking after 40 to 60 households; and what may
best be described as the Staff Officers attached to each of the 5
levels of <span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Organized upon a hierarchical basis, forming a pyramidal structure,
the principal Political Leaders on a scale of descending
authority were:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Fuehrer</span></p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> (Reich Leaders) and <span class='it'>Main Office</span> and <span class='it'>Office Holders</span></p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> (District Leaders) and Staff Officers</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Kreisleiter</span> (County Leaders) and Staff Officers</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Ortsgruppenleiter</span> (Local Chapter Leaders) and Staff Officers</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Zellenleiter</span> (Cell Leaders) and Staff Officers</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Blockleiter</span> (Block Leaders) and Staff Officers</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>A large part of this and other evidence relating to the composition
of the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party is to be found in the
1943 edition of the <span class='it'>Organization Book of the NSDAP</span>, an authoritative
primer on Nazi organizations which was edited by the defendant,
Reich Organization Leader of the NSDAP, Dr. Robert
Ley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Reichsleitung</span> of the Leadership Corps consisted of the
<span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> or Reich Leaders of the Party, the <span class='it'>Hauptaemter</span>
(Main Offices) and the <span class='it'>Aemter</span> (or Offices). The <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> of
the Party were, next to Hitler, the highest officeholders in the
Party hierarchy. All the <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> and Main Office and officeholders
within the <span class='it'>Reichsleitung</span> were appointed by Hitler and
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>
were directly responsible to him. <span class='it'>The Organization Book of the
NSDAP</span> puts it as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer appoints the following Political Directors:
“<span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> and all Political Directors, to include the Directors
of the Womens Leagues within the Reich Directorate or
<span class='it'>Reichsleitung</span>.” (<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The significant fact is that through the <span class='it'>Reichsleitung</span> perfect
coordination of Party and State machinery was guaranteed. The
Party Manual describes it this way:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the <span class='it'>Reichsleitung</span> the arteries of the organization of the
German people and of the German State merge.” (<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>To demonstrate that the <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> of the Leadership Corps
included the most powerful coalition of political overlords in Nazi
Germany, it is necessary only to mention their names. The list
of <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> includes the following defendants on trial: Rosenberg,
Von Schirach, Frick, Bormann, and Ley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The evidence to be presented will show that Rosenberg was the
leader of an organization named for him, the <span class='it'>Einsatzstab</span> Rosenberg,
which carried out a vast program of looting and plunder of
art treasures throughout occupied Europe. The evidence will
further show that, as Representative of the Fuehrer for the Supervision
of Nazi Ideology and Schooling, Rosenberg participated
in an aggressive campaign to undermine the Christian churches
and to supersede Christianity by a German National Church
founded upon a combination of irrationality, pseudo-scientific
theories, mysticism, and the cult of the racial state.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It will be shown that the late Defendant Ley, acting as the
agent of Hitler and the Leadership Corps, directed the Nazi assault
upon the independent labor unions of Germany and before
destroying himself first destroyed the free and independent labor
movement; and that he replaced it by a Nazi organization, the
German Labor front or DAF, which he employed as a means of
exploiting the German labor force in the interests of the conspiracy
and to instill Nazi ideology among the ranks of the German
workers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It will be shown that Frick participated in the enactment of
many laws which were designed to promote the conspiracy in its
several phases. Frick shares responsibility for the grave injury
done by the officials of the Leadership Corps to the concept of the
rule of law by virtue of his efforts to give the color of law and
formal legality to a large volume of Nazi legislation violative of
the rights of humanity, such as the legislation designed to stigmatize
and eliminate the Jewish people of Germany and German-occupied
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>
Europe. As chief of the Party Chancellery, immediately
under Hitler, Bormann was an extremely important force in directing
the activities of the Leadership Corps. As will be shown,
a decree of 16 January 1942 provided that the participation of
the Party in all important legislation, governmental appointments,
and promotions had to be undertaken exclusively by Bormann.
He took part in the preparation of all laws and decrees issued by
the Reich authorities and gave his assent to those of the subordinate
governments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The list of <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> of the NSDAP set forth in the <span class='it'>National
Socialist Yearbook</span> (1943 Edition) shows that the following 15
<span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> were in office in 1943 (<span class='it'>2473-PS</span>):</p>

The principal functions of the <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> included carrying
out the tasks and missions assigned to them by the Fuehrer or
by the Chief of the Party Chancellery, Martin Bormann. The
<span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> were further charged with insuring that Party
policies were being executed in all the subordinate areas of the
Reich. The <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> were also responsible for insuring a
continual flow of new leadership into the Party. With respect
to the function and responsibilities of the <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span>, the Organization
Book of the NSDAP states as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The NSDAP represents the political conception, the political
conscience, and the political will of the German nation.
Political conception, political conscience, and political will
are embodied in the person of the Fuehrer. Based on his
directives and in accordance with the program of the
NSDAP the organs of the Reich Directorate directionally
determine the political aims of the German people. It is in
the Reich Directorate that the arteries of the organization
of the German people and the State merge. It is the task
of the separate organs of the Reich Directorate to maintain
as close a contact as possible with the life of the nation
through their sub-offices in the Gau * * *</p>

<p>“The structure of the Reich Directorate is thus that the
channel from the lowest Party office upwards shows the most
minute weaknesses and changes in the mood of the people
* * *</p>

<p>“Another essential task of the Reich Directorate is to assure
a good selection of leaders. It is the duty of the Reich Directorate
to see that there is leadership in all phases of life, a
leadership which is firmly tied to National Socialist ideology
and which promotes its dissemination with all its energy
* * *</p>

<p>“* * * It is the supreme task of the Reich Organization
Leader to preserve the Party as a well-sharpened sword
for the Fuehrer.” (<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The domination of the German Government by the top members
of the Leadership Corps was facilitated by a circular decree
of the Reich Minister of Justice, dated 17 February 1934, which
established equal rank for the offices within the <span class='it'>Reichsleitung</span> of
the Leadership Corps and the Reich offices of the government.
In this decree it was expressly provided that
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“the supreme offices of the <span class='it'>Reichsleitung</span> are equal in rank
to the supreme Reich Government authorities.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The Party Manual termed the control exercised over the machinery
of government by the Leadership Corps “the permeation
of the State apparatus with the political will of the Party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Domination by the Leadership Corps over the German State
and Government was facilitated by uniting in the same Nazi
chieftains both high office within the <span class='it'>Reichsleitung</span> and corresponding
offices within the apparatus of government. For example,
Goebbels was a <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> in charge of Party propaganda,
but he was also a cabinet minister in charge of Propaganda
and Public Enlightenment. Himmler held office within the
<span class='it'>Reichsleitung</span> as head of the Main Office for “Volkdom” and as
Reichsfuehrer of the SS. At the same time, Himmler held the
governmental position of Reich Commission for the Consolidation
of Germandom and was the governmental head of the
German police system (<span class='it'>Chart Number 1</span>). This personal union
of high office in the Leadership Corps and high governmental
position in the same Nazi Leaders greatly assisted the plan of
the Leadership Corps to dominate and control the German State
and Government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to the <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span>, the <span class='it'>Reichsleitung</span> (Reich Party
Directorate) included about eleven <span class='it'>Hauptamter</span>, or Main Offices,
and about four <span class='it'>Amter</span>, or Offices. The <span class='it'>Hauptamter</span> of the Party
included such main organizations as those for personnel, training,
technology (headed by Speer), “Volkdom,” (headed by
Himmler), civil servants, communal policy, and the like. The
<span class='it'>Amter</span>, or offices, of the Party within the <span class='it'>Reichsleitung</span> included
the Office for Foreign Policy under Rosenberg which actively
participated in plans for aggression against Norway, the Office
for Colonial Policy, the Office for Geneology, and the Office for
Racial Policy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Certain of the main offices and offices within the <span class='it'>Reichsleitung</span>
appeared again within the <span class='it'>Gauleitung</span>, or Gau Party Directorate,
and <span class='it'>Kreisleitung</span>, or County Party Directorate. Thus, the <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span>
and main office and office holders within the <span class='it'>Reichsleitung</span>
exercised, through functional channels running through subordinate
offices on lower regional levels, total control over the
various sectors of the national life of Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Gauleiter.</span> For Party purposes Germany was divided into
major administrative regions, <span class='it'>Gaue</span>, which, in turn, were subdivided
into <span class='it'>Kreise</span> (counties), <span class='it'>Ortsgruppen</span> (local chapters),
<span class='it'>Zellen</span> (cells), and <span class='it'>Blocke</span> (blocks). Each <span class='it'>Gau</span> was in charge of
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>
a <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> who was the political leader of the <span class='it'>Gau</span> or district.
Each <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> was appointed by and was responsible to Hitler
himself. The <span class='it'>Organization Book of the NSDAP</span> states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The <span class='it'>Gau</span> represents the concentration of a number of Party
counties, or <span class='it'>Kreise</span>. The <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> is directly subordinate to
the Fuehrer. He is appointed by the Fuehrer. The <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span>
bears overall responsibility to the Fuehrer for the sector
of sovereignty entrusted to him. The rights, duties, and
jurisdiction of the <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> result primarily from the mission
assigned by the Fuehrer and, apart from that, from
detailed directives.” (<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The responsibility and function of the <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> and his staff
officers or office holders were essentially political, namely, to
insure the authority of the Nazi Party within his area, to coordinate
the activities of the Party and all its affiliated and supervised
organizations, and to enlarge the influence of the Party
over people and life in his <span class='it'>Gau</span> generally. Following the outbreak
of the war, when it became imperative to coordinate the
various phases of the German war effort, the <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> were
given additional important responsibilities. The Ministerial
Council for the Defense of the Reich, which was a sort of general
staff for civil defense and the mobilization of the German war
economy, by a decree of 1 September 1939 (1939, <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>,
Part I, page 1565), appointed about sixteen <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> as
Reich Defense Commissars. Later, under the impact of mounting
military reverses and an increasingly strained war economy,
more and more important administrative functions were put on a
<span class='it'>Gau</span> basis; the Party Gaue became the basic defense areas of the
Reich and each <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> became a Reich Defense Commissar
(Decree of the Ministerial Council for the Defense of the Reich
of 16 November 1942, 1942 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I, page 649).
In the course of the war, additional functions were entrusted
to the <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> so that at the end, with the exception of certain
special matters, such as police affairs, almost all phases of the
German war economy were coordinated and supervised by them.
For instance, regional authority over price control was put under
the <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> as Reich Defense Commissars, and housing administration
was placed under the <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> as <span class='it'>Gau</span> Housing
Commissar. Toward the end of the war, the <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> were
charged even with military and quasi military tasks. They were
made commanders of the <span class='it'>Volkssturm</span> in their areas and were entrusted
with such important functions as the evacuation of civilian
population in the path of the advancing Allied armies, as
well as measures for the destruction of vital installations.
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The structure and organization of the Party <span class='it'>Gau</span> were substantially
repeated in the lower levels of the Party organization
such as the <span class='it'>Kreise</span>, <span class='it'>Ortsgruppen</span>, Cells, and Blocks. Each of
these was headed by a political leader who, subject to the Fuehrer
principle and the orders of superior political leaders, was sovereign
within his sphere. The Leadership Corps of the Nazi
Party was in effect a “hierarchy of descending caesars.” Each
of the subordinate Party levels, such as <span class='it'>Kreise</span>, <span class='it'>Ortsgruppen</span>, and
so on, was organized into offices or <span class='it'>Amter</span> dealing with the various
specialized functions of the Party. But the number of such
departments and offices diminished as the Party unit dropped in
the hierarchy, so that, while the <span class='it'>Kreise</span> office contained all, or
most of the offices in the <span class='it'>Gau</span> (such as the deputy, the staff office
leader, an organization leader, school leader, propaganda leader,
press office leader, treasurer, judge of the Party Court, inspector,
and the like), the <span class='it'>Ortsgruppe</span> had less and the <span class='it'>Zellen</span> and <span class='it'>Blocke</span>
fewer still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Kreisleiter</span> (<span class='it'>County Leaders</span>). The <span class='it'>Kreisleiter</span> was appointed
and dismissed by Hitler upon the nomination of the
<span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> and directly subordinate to the <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> in the Party
hierarchy. The <span class='it'>Kreis</span> usually comprised a single county. The
<span class='it'>Kreisleiter</span>, within the <span class='it'>Kreis</span>, had in general the same position,
powers, and prerogatives granted the <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> in the <span class='it'>Gau</span>. In
cities they constituted the very core of Party power and organization.
According to the <span class='it'>Organization Book of the NSDAP</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The <span class='it'>Kreisleiter</span> carries over-all responsibility towards the
<span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> within his zone of sovereignty for the political and
ideological training and organization of the Political Leaders,
the Party members, as well as the population.” (<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Ortsgruppenleiter</span> (<span class='it'>Local Chapter Leaders</span>). The area of
the <span class='it'>Ortsgruppenleiter</span> comprised one or more communes or, in a
town, a certain district. The <span class='it'>Ortsgruppe</span> was composed of a combination
of blocks and cells and, according to local circumstances,
contained up to 1500 households. The <span class='it'>Ortsgruppenleiter</span> also had
a staff of office leaders to assist him in the various functional activities
of the Party. All other political leaders in his area of
responsibility were subordinate to and under the direction of the
<span class='it'>Ortsgruppenleiter</span>. For example, the leaders of the various affiliated
organizations of the Party, within his area, such as the
German Labor Front, and the Nazi organizations for lawyers,
students, and civil servants, were all subordinate to the <span class='it'>Ortsgruppenleiter</span>.
In accordance with the Fuehrer principle, the
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>
<span class='it'>Ortsgruppenleiter</span> or Local Chapter Leaders were appointed by
the <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> and were directly under and subordinate to the
<span class='it'>Kreisleiter</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The party Manual provides as follows with respect to the <span class='it'>Ortsgruppenleiter</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“As <span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span> [Bearer of Sovereignty] all expressions
of the Party will emanate from the <span class='it'>Ortsgruppenleiter</span>; he is
responsible for the political and ideological leadership and
organization within his zone of sovereignty.</p>

<p>“The <span class='it'>Ortsgruppenleiter</span> carries the over-all responsibility for
the political results of all measures initiated by the offices,
organizations, and affiliated associations of the Party.
* * * The <span class='it'>Ortsgruppenleiter</span> has the right to protest to
the <span class='it'>Kreisleiter</span> against any measures contrary to the interests
of the Party with regard to an outside political appearance in
public.” (<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>Zellenleiter</span> (<span class='it'>Cell Leaders</span>). The <span class='it'>Zellenleiter</span> was responsible
for four to eight blocks. He was the immediate superior of
and had control and supervision over the <span class='it'>Blockleiter</span> (Block
Leader). His mission and duties, according to the Party Manual,
corresponded to the missions of the <span class='it'>Blockleiter</span>. (<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(5) <span class='it'>Blockleiter</span> (<span class='it'>Block Leaders</span>). The <span class='it'>Blockleiter</span> was the one
Party official who was peculiarly in a position to have continuous
contact with the German people. The <span class='it'>block</span> was the lowest unit
in the Party pyramidal organization. The <span class='it'>block</span> of the Party
comprised 40 to 60 households and was regarded by the Party as
the focal point upon which to press the weight of its propaganda.
The <span class='it'>Organization Book of the NSDAP</span> states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The household is the basic community upon which the block
and cell system is built. The household is the organizational
focal point of all Germans united in an apartment and includes
roomers, domestic help, etc. * * * The <span class='it'>Blockleiter</span>
has jurisdiction over all matters within his zone relating
to the Movement and is fully responsible to the <span class='it'>Zellenleiter</span>.
* * *” (<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Blockleiter</span>, as in the case of other political leaders, was
charged with planning, disseminating, and developing a receptivity
to the policies of the Nazi Party among the population in
his area of responsibility. It was also the expressed duty of the
<span class='it'>Blockleiter</span> to spy on the population. According to the Party
Manual:
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“It is the duty of the <span class='it'>Blockleiter</span> to find people disseminating
damaging rumors and to report them to the <span class='it'>Ortsgruppe</span> so
that they may be reported to the respective State authorities.</p>

<p>“The <span class='it'>Blockleiter</span> must not only be preacher and defender of
the National Socialist ideology towards the members of nation
and Party entrusted to his political care, but he must
also strive to achieve practical collaboration of the Party
members within his block zone * * *.”</p>

<p>“The <span class='it'>Blockleiter</span> shall continuously remind the Party members
of their particular duties towards the people and the
State * * * The <span class='it'>Blockleiter</span> keeps a list (card file)
about the households * * * In principle, the <span class='it'>Blockleiter</span>
will settle his official business verbally and he will receive
messages verbally and pass them on in the same way. Correspondence
will only be used in cases of absolute necessity
* * * The <span class='it'>Blockleiter</span> conducts National Socialist propaganda
from mouth to mouth. He will eventually awaken the
understanding of the eternally dissatisfied as regards the
frequently misunderstood or wrongly interpreted measures
and laws of the National Socialist Government * * * It
is not necessary to him to fall in with complaints and gripes
about possibly obvious shortcomings of any kind in order to
demonstrate * * * solidarity * * * A condition
to gain the confidence of all people is to maintain absolute secrecy
in all matters.” (<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>There were in Germany around a half million of these <span class='it'>Blockleiter</span>.
Large though this figure may appear, there can be no
doubt that these officials were in and of the Leadership Corps of
the Nazi Party. Though they stood at the broad base of the Party
pyramid rather than at its summit, where rested the <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span>,
by virtue of this fact they were stationed at close intervals
throughout the German civil population. It may be doubted that
the average German ever looked upon the face of Heinrich Himmler.
But the man in the street in Nazi Germany could not have
avoided an uneasy acquaintance with the <span class='it'>Blockleiter</span> in his neighbourhood.
It was the block leaders who represented to the people
of Germany the police-state of Hitler’s Germany. In fact, the
<span class='it'>Blockleiter</span> were little fuehrers with real power over the civilians
in their domains. The authority of the <span class='it'>Blockleiter</span> to exercise
coercion and the threat of force upon the civil population is shown
in an excerpt from page 7 of the magazine published by the Chief
Education Office of the Party, entitled “The Face of the Party”:

Party certain of the Political Leaders possessed a higher degree
of responsibility than others, were vested with special prerogatives,
and constituted a distinctive and elite group. These were
the so-called “<span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span>” (Bearers of Sovereignty) who represented
the Party within their area of jurisdiction, the so-called
<span class='it'>Hoheitsgebiet</span>. The Party Manual (<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>) states as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Among the Political Leaders, the <span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span> assumed a

<p class='pindent'>The distinctive character of the <span class='it'>Politischer Leiter</span> (Political
Leaders) constituting the <span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span>, and their existence and
operation as an identifiable group, are indicated by the publication
of a magazine, entitled <span class='it'>Der Hoheitstraeger</span>, whose distribution
was limited by regulation of the Reich Organization Leader
to the <span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span> and certain other designated <span class='it'>Politischer
Leiter</span>. The inside cover of this exclusive Party magazine reads
as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“<span class='it'>DER HOHEITSTRAEGER</span>, the contents of which is to be
handled confidentially, serves only for the orientation of the
competent leaders. It may not be loaned out to other persons
* * *” [then follows a list of the Hoheitstraeger
and other Political Leaders authorized to receive the magazine.]
(<span class='it'>2660-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The magazine states that, in addition, the following were
entitled to receive it:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Commandants, Unit Commanders and Candidates of Order
Castles; the Reich, Shock Troop and <span class='it'>Gaue</span> Speakers of the
NSDAP; the Lieutenant Generals and Major Generals of
SA, SS, NSFK, and NSKK; Lieutenant Generals and Major
Generals of the HJ.” (<span class='it'>2660-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The fact that this magazine existed, that it derived its name
from the Commanding Officers of the Leadership Corps, that it
was distributed to the elite of the Leadership Corps—that a
House Bulletin was circulated down the command channels of
the Leadership Corps—demonstrates that the Leadership Corps
of the Nazi Party was an identifiable group or organization
within the meaning of Article 9 of the Charter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An examination of the contents of the magazine <span class='it'>Der Hoheitstrager</span>
reveals a continuing concern by the Leadership Corps of
the Nazi Party in measures and doctrines which were employed
throughout the course of the conspiracy. The plans and policies
of the inner elite of the Leadership Corps gain clarity through
a random sampling of articles published and policies advocated
in various issues of the magazine <span class='it'>Der Hoheitstrager</span>. From
February 1937 to October 1938 these included the following:
anti-Semitic articles, attacks on Catholicism and the Christian
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>
religion and clergy; the need for motorized armament; the
urgent need for expanded <span class='it'>Lebensraum</span> and colonies; persistent
attacks on the League of Nations; the use of the Block and Cell
in achieving favorable votes in Party plebiscites; the intimate
association between the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> and the Political Leadership;
the racial doctrines of Fascism; the cult of “leadership”;
the role of the <span class='it'>Gaue</span>, <span class='it'>Ortsgruppen</span>, and <span class='it'>Zellen</span> in the expansion
of Germany; and related matters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) <span class='it'>Organization of Political Leaders.</span> The Political Leaders
were organized according to the leadership principle (<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The basis of the Party organization is the Fuehrer thought.
The public is unable to rule itself either directly or indirectly
* * * All Political Leaders stand as appointed
by the Fuehrer and are responsible to him. They possess
full authority toward the lower echelons * * * Only a
man who has absorbed the school of subordinate functions
within the Party has a claim to the higher Fuehrer offices.
We can only use Fuehrers who have served from the ground
up. Any Political Leader who does not conform to these
principles is to be dismissed or to be sent back to the lower
offices, as <span class='it'>Blockleiter</span>, <span class='it'>Zellenleiter</span> for further training
* * *</p>

<p>“The Political Leader is not an office worker but the Political
Deputy of the Fuehrer * * * Within the Political Leadership,
we are building the Political Leadership of the state
* * * The type of the Political Leader is not characterized
by the office which he represents. There is no such
thing as a Political Leader of the NSBO, etc., but there is
only the Political Leader of the NSDAP.” (<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Each Political Leader was sworn in yearly. According to the
Party Manual (<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>), the wording of the oath was as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I pledge eternal allegiance to Adolf Hitler. I pledge unconditional
obedience to him and the Fuehrers appointed by
him.” (<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Organization Book of the NSDAP also provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Political Leader is inseparably tied to the ideology and
the organization of the NSDAP. His oath only ends with
his death or with his expulsion from the National Socialist
community.” (<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) <span class='it'>Appointment of Political Leaders.</span> The appointment of
the political leaders constituting the Leadership Corps of the
Nazi Party proceeded as follows, according to the Party Manual:</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>c.</span> Power <span class='it'>of Hoheitstraeger to Call Upon Party Formations</span>.
The <span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span> among the Leadership Corps were entitled to
call upon and utilize the various Party Formations as necessary
for the execution of Nazi Party policies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Party Manual makes it clear that the <span class='it'>Hoheitstrager</span> has
power and authority to requisition the services of the SA:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The <span class='it'>Hoheitstrager</span> is responsible for the entire political appearance
of the Movement within his zone. The SA leader
of that zone is tied to the directives of the <span class='it'>Hoheitstrager</span> in
that respect.</p>

<p>“The <span class='it'>Hoheitstrager</span> is the ranking representative of the
Party to include all organizations within his zone. He may
requisition the SA located within his zone from the respective
SA leader if they are needed for the execution of a political
mission. The <span class='it'>Hoheitstrager</span> will then assign the mission
to the SA * * *</p>

<p>“Should the <span class='it'>Hoheitstrager</span> need more SA for the execution
of political mission than is locally available, he then applies
to the next higher office of sovereignty which, in turn, requests
the SA from the SA office in his sector.” (<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The <span class='it'>Hoheitstrager</span> also had the same authority to call upon the
services of the SS and NSKK (<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Hoheitstrager</span> further, had authority to call upon the services
of the Hitler Youth (HJ):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Political Leader has the right to requisition the HJ in
the same manner as the SA for the execution of a political
action.</p>

<p>“In appointing leaders of the HJ and the DJ, the office of the
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>
HJ must procure the approval of the <span class='it'>Hoheitstrager</span> of his
zone. This means that the <span class='it'>Hoheitstrager</span> can prevent the
appointment of leaders unsuited for the leadership of youth.
If his approval has not been procured, an appointment may
be cancelled if he so requests.” (<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>An example of the use of the Party Formations at the call of
the Leadership Corps of the Party is provided by the action taken
by the <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> for Party Organization of the NSDAP, Dr.
Robert Ley, leading to the deliberate dissolution of the Free Trade
Unions on 2 May 1933. A directive issued by <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> Ley on
21 April 1933 (<span class='it'>392-PS</span>) ordered the employment of the SA and
the SS in occupying trade union properties and in taking trade

<p class='pindent'>A decree issued by Hess as Deputy of the Fuehrer, dated 25

with respect to the Party Formations:</p>

<p>“The political leadership within the Party and its political
representation towards all offices, State or others, which are

</div>

<p><span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the official policy of the Leadership Corps to establish
close and cooperative relations with the Gestapo. The Head of
the German Police and SS, Himmler, was a <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> on the
top level of the Leadership Corps. A decree issued by Bormann,
as Chief of Staff of the Deputy of the Fuehrer, dated 26 June
1935, provided the following:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“In order to effect a closer contact between the offices of the
Party and its organizations with the Directors of the Secret
State Police [Gestapo], the Deputy of the Fuehrer requests

the larger official rallies of the Party and its organization.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>d</span>) <span class='it'>Meetings of the Political Leaders.</span> The contention of the
Prosecution that the members of the Leadership Corps constituted
a distinctive and identifiable group or organization is
strongly supported by the fact that the various <span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span>
(such as the <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span>, <span class='it'>Kreisleiter</span>, <span class='it'>Ortsgruppenleiter</span>, and so on)
were under an absolute obligation to meet and confer periodically,
not only with the staff officers on their own staffs, but with
the political leaders and staff officers immediately subordinate
to them. For example, the <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> was bound to confer with his
staff officers (such as his deputy, his staff office leader, his organization
leader, school leader, propaganda leader, press leader,
his <span class='it'>Gau</span> Party Judge, and so on) every 8 to 14 days. Furthermore,
the <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> was obligated to meet with the various <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span>
subordinate to him once every 3 months for a 3-day convention
for the purpose of discussing and clarifying Nazi Party
policies and directives, for hearing basic lectures on Party policy,
and for the mutual exchange of information pertinent to the
Party’s current program. The <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> was also obligated to
meet at least once a month with the leaders of the Party formations
and affiliated organizations within his <span class='it'>Gau</span> area, such as
the leaders of the SA, SS, Hitler Youth and others. These matters
are set forth in the <span class='it'>Organization Book of the NSDAP</span>
(<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>) as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Leader conferences in the District:</p>

<p>“(a) District Leaders (<span class='it'>Gauleiter</span>) with his staff every 8 to
14 days.</p>

<p>“(b) It is further absolutely necessary that the directors
of the <span class='it'>Gau</span> offices will meet with the county directors of their
district once every three months for a three-day convention
(possibly at a district schooling castle) where they will
have an opportunity to overcome difficulties of personal and
professional nature, apart from hearing fundamental lectures,
by social gatherings in the presence of the bearer of
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>
the sovereignty, by getting to know each other and by a
mutual exchange of ideas. Participation in these conferences
is compulsory and duty would not constitute an excuse
under any circumstances.</p>

<p>“(c) The arrangement of social meeting in the presence
of leaders of the organizations of RAD and NSFK of the
respective zone of sovereignty. In the course of these meetings
differences of opinion may be straightened out in discussions.</p>

<p>“(d) The bearer of sovereignty will meet at least once a
month with the leaders of the SA, SS, NSKK, HJ, as well as
the RAD and the NSFK who are within the zone for the
purpose of mutual orientation.” (<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Organization Book of the Party</span> imposes a similar requirement
of regular and periodical conferences and meetings
upon all the other <span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span>, including the <span class='it'>Kreisleiter</span>, <span class='it'>Ortsgruppenleiter</span>,
<span class='it'>Zellenleiter</span>, and <span class='it'>Blockleiter</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clear consequence of such regular and obligatory conferences
and meetings by all the <span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span>, both with their own
staff officers and with the political leaders and staff officers
subordinate to them, was that basic Nazi policies and directives
issued by Hitler and the leader of the Party Chancellery, Bormann,
directly through the chain of command of the <span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span>,
and functional policies issued by the various <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span>
and Reich office holders through functional and technical channels,
were certain to be brought to the attention and understanding
of the bulk of the membership of the Leadership Corps.
When this fact is coupled with the further fact that all the members
of the Leadership Corps under the Leadership Principle
and their sworn oaths, were bound to obey blindly and without
question orders received from their competent superiors, it is
clear that the general membership of the Leadership Corps is
responsible for measures taken or ordered by that organization
in furtherance of the conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(7) <span class='it'>Statistics Relating to the Leadership Corps.</span> As previously
shown, the Leadership Corps comprised the sum of officials of the
Nazi Party, including, in addition to Hitler and the members of
the <span class='it'>Reichsleitung</span>, such as the <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> and the Reich office
holders, a hierarchy of <span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span> (ranging from the <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span>
down to the <span class='it'>Blockleiter</span>) as well as the staff officers attached
to the <span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span>. According to page 10 of issue No.

<p class='pindent'>However, as shown by previous evidence, the Leadership Corps
was composed not only of the <span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span> (such as <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span>,
<span class='it'>Kreisleiter</span>, <span class='it'>Ortsgruppenleiter</span>, <span class='it'>Zellenleiter</span>, and <span class='it'>Blockleiter</span>) but
also of the staff officers or office holders attached to these <span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span>.
The <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span>, for example, was assisted by a deputy
<span class='it'>Gauleiter</span>, several <span class='it'>Gau</span> inspectors, and a staff which was divided
into main offices (<span class='it'>Hauptamter</span>) and offices (<span class='it'>Amter</span>), including
such departments as the <span class='it'>Gau</span> staff Office, Treasury, Education Office,
Propaganda Office, Press Office, University Teachers, Communal
Policy, etc. As previously shown in evidence, the staff office
structure of the <span class='it'>Gau</span> was substantially represented in the
lower levels of the Leadership Corps organization such as the
<span class='it'>Kreise</span>, <span class='it'>Ortsgruppen</span>, and so on. The <span class='it'>Kreise</span> and the smaller territorial
areas of the Party were also organized into staff offices
dealing with the various activities of the Leadership Corps. But,
of course, the importance and the number of such staff offices
diminished as the unit dropped in the hierarchy; so that, while the
<span class='it'>Kreisleiter</span> staff contained all or most of the departments mentioned
for the <span class='it'>Gau</span>, the <span class='it'>Ortsgruppe</span> had fewer departments and
the lower ones fewer still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Firm figures have not been found as to the total number of
staff officers, as distinguished from the <span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span> or political
commanders themselves included within the Leadership Corps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is the view of the prosecution that in defining the scope and
composition of the Leadership Corps, staff officers should be included
only down to and including the <span class='it'>Kreise</span>. Upon this basis,
the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party constituted the Fuehrer,
the members of the <span class='it'>Reichsleitung</span>, the 5 levels of <span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span>
(ranging from <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> down through the <span class='it'>Blockleiter</span>), and the
staff officers attached to the 40-odd <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> and the eight to
nine hundred <span class='it'>Kreisleiter</span>. Adopting this definition of the Leadership
Corps, it will be seen that the total figure for the membership
of that organization, based upon the statistics cited from the
basic handbook for Germany, amounts to around 700,000.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is true that this figure is based upon an admittedly limited
view of the size of the membership of the Leadership Corps of the
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>
Nazi Party; for the evidence has shown that the Leadership Corps
in effect embraced staff officers attached to the subordinate <span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span>,
and inclusion of such staff officers in the estimation
of the size of the Leadership Corps would have very considerably
enlarged the final figure estimated to a total of 2,000,000. The
Prosecution, however, proposes to exclude such subordinate staff
officers for the reason that their participation in and responsibility
for the Conspiracy were measurably less extensive than
those of the staff officers and office holders on the higher levels of
the Leadership Corps. The subordinate staff officers thus excluded
were responsible functionally to the higher staff officers with respect
to their particular specialty, such as propaganda, Party organization,
and so on, and to their respective <span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span> with
respect to discipline and policy control. Likewise, such higher
staff officers participated in planning and policy discussions, and
also issued orders through technical channels to lower staff officers.</p>

<h3>B. <span class='it'>Participation of the Leadership Corps in the Conspiracy.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>The Program of the Nazi Party, proclaimed by Hitler, the
Fuehrer of the Leadership Corps, on 24 February 1920 (<span class='it'>1708-PS</span>),
contained the chief elements of the Nazi plan for domination and
conquest. The first point required the incorporation of all Germans
into a Greater German Reich. Point 2 demanded unilateral
abolition of the Peace Treaties of Versailles and St. Germain.
Point 3 stated the demand for “land and soil” (colonies). Point 4
proclaimed the Nazi doctrines of racial discrimination and anti-Semitism.
Point 6 proclaimed the fight against the democratic-parliamentary
system, as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * We demand that every public office, of any sort,
whatsover, whether in the Reich, the county or municipality,
be filled only by citizens. We combat the corrupting parliamentary
economy, office-holding only according to Party
inclinations without consideration of character or abilities.”
(<span class='it'>1708-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Point 22 expressed the Nazi plans and policies for rearmament as
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“We demand the abolition of the mercenary troops and formation
of a National Army.” (<span class='it'>1708-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>The official Party Program declares on its face that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The program is the political foundation of the NSDAP and
accordingly the primary political law of the State * * *
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span></p>

<p>“All legal precepts are to be applied in the spirit of the Party
Program.</p>

<p>“Since the taking over of control, the Fuehrer has succeeded
in the realization of the essential portions of the Party Program
from the fundamentals to the details.</p>

<p>“The Party Program of the NSDAP was proclaimed on 24
February 1920 by Adolf Hitler at the first large Party gathering
in Munich and since that day has remained unaltered
* * * The National Socialist philosophy is summarized
in 25 points.” (<span class='it'>1708-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As previously stated, the Party Program was binding upon the
Political Leaders of the Leadership Corps, and they were under
a duty to support and carry out that Program. As the Party
Manual puts it:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Commandments of the National Socialists:</p>

<p>“The Fuehrer is always right * * *.</p>

<p>“The Program be your dogma.</p>

<p>“It demands your utter devotion to the Movement * * *.</p>

<p>“Right is what serves the Movement and thus Germany.</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“* * * Leader Corps is responsible for the complete penetration
of the German Nation with the National Socialist
spirit * * *.” (<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The oath of the Political Leader to Hitler has been previously
referred to. In connection therewith, the Party Manual provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Political Leader is inseparably tied to the ideology and
the organization of the NSDAP. His oath only ends with his
death or with his expulsion from the National Socialist community.”
(<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>While the leadership principle assured the binding nature of
Hitler’s statements, program, and policies upon the entire Party
and the Leadership Corps, the leadership principle also established
the full responsibility of the individual Political Leader
within the province and jurisdiction of his office or position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The leadership principle applied not only to Hitler as the supreme
leader, but also to the Political Leaders under him, and
thus permeated the entire Leadership Corps:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The basis of the Party Organization is the Fuehrer thought
* * * All Political Leaders stand as appointed by the
Fuehrer and are responsible to him. They possess full authority
toward the lower echelons * * *.” (<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The various <span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span> of the Leadership Corps were, in
their respective areas of responsibility, themselves <span class='it'>Fuehrer</span>:
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Within their sector of sovereignty, the <span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span> (<span class='it'>Gauleiter</span>,
<span class='it'>Kreisleiter</span>, <span class='it'>Ortsgruppenleiter</span>, <span class='it'>Zellenleiter</span>, <span class='it'>Blockleiter</span>)
have sovereign political rights * * * They are
responsible for the entire political situation within their sector
* * *” (<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>As stated in the <span class='it'>Organization Book of the NSDAP</span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Party is an order of ‘Fuehrer’.” (<span class='it'>1814-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The subjection of the entire membership of the Leadership
Corps to the fiat of the Fuehrer Principle is clearly shown in the
following passage from the Party Manual:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * a solid anchorage for all the organizations within
the party structure is provided and a firm connection with
the sovereign leaders of the NSDAP is created in accordance
with the Fuehrer Principle.” (<span class='it'>1814-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Domination and Control of the German State and Government
by the Nazi Party, directed by the Leadership Corps.</span> On 23
March 1933 the Reichstag enacted a law conferring power on the
Reich Cabinet to legislate on its own authority (<span class='it'>2001-PS</span>). Prominent
members of the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party were
members of the Reich Cabinet. The presence of <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> and
other prominent members of the Leadership Corps in the Cabinet
facilitated the domination of the Cabinet by the Nazi Party and
the Leadership Corps. For example, a decree of 13 March 1933
established the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda.
The head of this ministry was Goebbels, who simultaneously
was <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> for Propaganda of the NSDAP (<span class='it'>2029-PS</span>).
Examples of personal union between high officials in the Leadership
and Cabinet membership existed in the case of the Food
Minister, the Chief of the German Police, the Reich Labor Leader,
the Chief of the Party Organization in Foreign Countries, and the
Reich Youth Fuehrer (<span class='it'>2473-PS</span>). Moreover, the majority of the
Reich Ministries were occupied by leading old Party Members.
All Reich Ministers were accepted by the Party on 30 January
1937 and were decorated with the Golden Party Insignia. (<span class='it'>1774-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>A law of 14 July 1933 outlawed and forbade the formation of
any political parties other than the Nazi Party and made violation
of this decree a punishable crime. Thereby the one party
State was established and the Leadership Corps was rendered
immune from the opposition of organized political groups. This
Law Against the Formation of New Political Parties reads as
follows:
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The National Socialist German Workers’ Party constitutes
the only political party in Germany. Whoever undertakes to
maintain the organizational structure of another political
party or to form a new political party will be punished with
penal servitude up to three years or with imprisonment of
from six months to three years, if the deed is not subject to
a greater penalty according to other regulations.” (<span class='it'>1388-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A law was enacted on 20 July 1933 providing for the dismissal
of officials who belonged to the Communist Party or who were
otherwise active in furthering the aims of Communism. The law
also provided for the dismissal of those who were in the future
active for Marxism, Communism, or Social Democracy (Law to
Supplement the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil
Service, 20 July 1933, (1933 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I, page 518)).
(<span class='it'>1398-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 13 October 1933 a “law to guarantee public peace” was enacted
which provided, <span class='it'>inter alia</span>, that the death penalty or other
severe punishment should be imposed upon any person who—</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * undertakes to kill a member of the SA or the SS,
a trustee or agent of the NSDAP * * * out of political
motives or on account of their official activity.” (<span class='it'>1394-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 1 December 1933 a law was enacted “to secure the unity of
Party and State.” This law provided that the Nazi Party was the
pillar of the German State, and was linked to it indissolubly; it
also made the Deputy of the Fuehrer (then Hess) and the Chief
of Staff of the SA (then Roehm) members of the Reich Cabinet
(<span class='it'>1395-PS</span>). The pertinent provisions of this law read as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“After the victory of the National Socialist Revolution, the
National Socialistic German Labor Party is the bearer of
the concept of the German State and is inseparably the State.
It will be a part of the public law. Its organization will be
determined by the Fuehrer * * *.</p>

<p>“The Deputy of the Fuehrer and the Chief of Staff of the SA
will become members of the Reich Government in order to
insure close cooperation of the offices of the Party and SA
with the public authorities * * *.” (<span class='it'>1395-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This law was a basic measure in enthroning the Leadership
Corps in a position of supreme political power in Germany. For it
laid it down that the Party, directed by the Leadership Corps, was
the embodiment of the State and, in fact, was the State. Moreover,
this law made both the Fuehrer’s Deputy and the Chief of
Staff of the SA, which was a Party Formation subject to the call
of the <span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span>, Cabinet Members. Thus, the Leadership
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>
Corps’ control of the Cabinet was further solidified. The dominant
position of the Leadership Corps is further revealed by the provision
that the Reichs-Chancellor would issue the regulations
carrying out this law in his capacity as Fuehrer of the Nazi Party.
The fact that Hitler, as Fuehrer of the Leadership Corps, could
promulgate rules which would have statutory force and be published
in the <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, the proper compilation for State
enactments, is but a further reflection of the reality of the Party’s
domination of the German State.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a declaration to the 1935 Party Congress at Nurnberg, Hitler
stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is not the State which gives orders to us, it is we who
give orders to the State.” (<span class='it'>2775-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>That categorical statement of the Fuehrer of the Leadership
Corps affirms the dominance of Party over State which the evidence
makes undeniably clear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 30 June 1934 Hitler, as Head of the Nazi Party, directed
the massacre of hundreds of SA-men and other political opponents.
Hitler sought to justify these mass murders by declaring to the
Reichstag that “at that hour I was responsible for the fate of the
German nation and supreme judge of the German people.” (The
evidence relating to these events is discussed in Section 4, infra.)
On 3 July 1934 the Cabinet issued a decree describing the murders
of 30 June 1934, in effect, as legitimate self-defense by the
State. By this law the Reich Cabinet made themselves accessories
after the fact of these murders. The domination of State by
Party, however, makes the Cabinet’s characterization of these
criminal acts by Hitler and his top Party Leaders as state measures
consistent with political reality. The single article of the
law of 3 July 1934 reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The measures taken on 30 June and 1 and 2 July 1934 to
counteract attempt at treason and high treason shall be considered
as national emergency defense.” (<span class='it'>2057-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 12 July 1934 there was enacted a law defining the function
of the Academy for German law:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Closely connected with the agencies competent for legislation,
it [the Academy] shall further the realization of the
National Socialist program in the realm of the law.” (<span class='it'>1391-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 30 January 1933, Hitler, the Leader of the Nazi Party and
Fuehrer of the Leadership Corps, was appointed Chancellor of
the Reich. When President von Hindenburg died in 1934, the
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>
Fuehrer amalgamated in his person the offices of Chancellor and
Reich President. (<span class='it'>2003-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>By a decree of 20 December 1934 Party uniforms and institutions
were granted the same protection as those of the State. This
law was entitled “Law Concerning Treacherous Acts Against the
State and Party, and for the Protection of Party Uniforms.” This
law imposed heavy penalties upon any person making false statements
injuring the welfare or prestige of the Nazi Party or its
agencies. It authorized the imprisonment of persons making or
circulating malicious or baiting statements against leading personalities
of the Nazi Party. And it provided punishment by
forced labor for the unauthorized wearing of Party uniforms or
symbols. (<span class='it'>1393-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>By a law of 15 September 1934, the Swastika flag of the Party
was made the official flag of the Reich (<span class='it'>2079-PS</span>). This law, enacted
by the Reichstag, indicates on its face that it issued from
Nurnberg on the Party Day of 15 September 1935. Article 2 of
this law reads as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Reich and National flag is the swastika flag.” (<span class='it'>2079-PS</span>)
The Swastika was the flag and symbol of the Leadership Corps of
the Nazi Party. The law making it the flag of the State constituted
a recognition that the Party and its Corps of Political Leaders
were the sovereign powers in Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 23 April 1936, a law was enacted granting amnesty for
crimes which the offender had committed “in his eagerness to
fight for the National Socialist Ideal.” (<span class='it'>1386-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In furtherance of the Conspiracy to acquire totalitarian control
over the German people, a law was enacted on 1 December
1936, which incorporated the entire German youth within the
Hitler Youth, thereby achieving a “total mobilization of German
youth” (<span class='it'>1392-PS</span>). The law further provided that the task of
educating the German youth through the Hitler Youth was entrusted
to the <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> of German Youth in the NSDAP. By
this law a monopoly control over the entire German youth was
placed in the hands of a top official, a <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span>, of the Leadership
Corps of the Nazi Party, the defendant von Schirach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 4 February 1938, the Fuehrer of the Leadership Corps of
the NSDAP, Hitler, issued a decree in which he took over directly
the command of the whole Armed Forces (<span class='it'>1915-PS</span>). In this decree,
Hitler declared, in part, as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“From now on, I take over directly the command of the whole
Armed Forces.” (<span class='it'>1915-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>By the decree of 4 February 1938, Hitler became Supreme Commander
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>
of the Armed Forces. He was, at the time of its issuance,
Fuehrer of the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party. By virtue
of the earlier law of 1 August 1934, he combined the office of
Reich President with that of the Chancellorship. In the final result,
therefore, Hitler was Supreme Commander of the Armed
Forces, Head of the German State, and Fuehrer of the Nazi Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With respect to the foregoing point, the Party Manual (<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>)
states as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * the Fuehrer created the National Socialist German
Workers’ Party. He filled it with his spirit and his will
and with it he conquered the power of the State on 30 January
1933. The Fuehrer’s will is supreme in the Party.</p>

<p>“By authority of the law about the Chief of State of the German
Reich, dated 1 August 1934, the office of the Reich President
has been combined with that of the Reich Chancellery.
Consequently, the powers heretofore possessed by the Reich
President were transferred to the Fuehrer, Adolf Hitler.
Through this law, the conduct of Party and State has been
combined in one hand. By desire of the Fuehrer, a plebiscite
was conducted on this law on 19 August 1934. On this day,
the German people chose Adolf Hitler to be their sole leader.
He is responsible only to his conscience and to the German
nation.” (<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A decree of 16 January 1942 provided that the Party should
participate in legislation, official appointments, and promotions
(<span class='it'>2100-PS</span>). The decree further provided that such participation
should be undertaken exclusively by Bormann, Chief of the Party
Chancellery and a <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> of the Leadership Corps of the
Nazi Party. The decree provided that the Chief of the Party Chancellery
was to take part in the preparation of all laws and decrees
issued by Reich authorities, including those issued by the Ministerial
Council for Defense of the Reich, and to give his assent to
those of the Laender and the Reich governors; all communications
between State and Party authorities, unless within one <span class='it'>Gau</span> only,
were to pass through his hands. This decree is of crucial importance
in demonstrating the ultimate control and responsibility
imputable to the Leadership Corps for governmental policy and
actions taken in furtherance of the conspiracy. (<span class='it'>2100-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On or about 26 April 1942, Hitler declared in a speech that, in
his capacity as Leader of the Nation, Supreme Commander of the
Armed Forces, Supreme Head of the Government, and as Fuehrer
of the Party, his right must be recognized to compel with all
means at his disposal, every German, whether soldier, judge, State
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>
official, or party official, to fulfill his desire. He demanded that
the Reichstag officially recognize this asserted right. On 26 April
1942, the German Reichstag issued a decision in which full recognition
was given to the rights which the Fuehrer had asserted
(<span class='it'>1961-PS</span>). The Reichstag decreed as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“At the proposal of the President of the Reichstag, on its
session of 26 April 1942, the greater German Reichstag has
approved of the rights which the Fuehrer has postulated in
his speech with the following decision:</p>

<p>“There can be no doubt, that in the present war, in which
the German people is faced with a struggle for its existence
or annihilation, the Fuehrer must have all the rights postulated
by him which serve to further or achieve victory. Therefore—without
being bound by existing legal regulations—in
his capacity as Leader of the Nation, Supreme Commander
of the Armed Forces, Governmental Chief and Supreme Executive
Chief, as Supreme Justice and Leader of the Party—the
Fuehrer must be in a position to force with all means at
his disposal every German, if necessary, whether he be common
soldier or officer, low or high official or judge, leading or
subordinate official of the Party, worker or employee—to fulfill
his duties. In case of violation of these duties, the Fuehrer
is entitled, after conscientious examination, regardless of so-called
well-deserved rights, to mete out due punishment and
to remove the offender from his post, rank and position without
introducing prescribed procedures.</p>

<p>“At the order of the Fuehrer, this decision is hereby made
public. Berlin, 26 April 1942.” (<span class='it'>1961-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler himself perhaps best summarized the political realities
of his Germany, in showing the domination of the German State
and Government by the Leadership Corps and its following. The
core of the matter was stated by Hitler in his speech to the Reichstag
on 20 February 1938, when he declared in effect that every
institution in Germany was under the direction of the Leadership
Corps of the Nazi Party:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“National Socialism has given the German people that leadership
which as Party not only mobilizes the nation but also
organizes it, so that on the basis of the natural principle of
selection, the continuance of a stable political leadership is
safeguarded forever * * * National Socialism * * *
possesses Germany entirely and completely since the day
when, five years ago, I left the house in Wilhelmsplatz as
Reich Chancellor. There is no institution in this state which
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>
is not National Socialist. Above all, however, the National
Socialist Party in these five years not only has made the nation
National Socialist, but also has given itself that perfect
organizational structure which guarantees its permanence
for all future. The greatest guarantee of the National Socialist
revolution lies in the complete domination of the Reich
and all its institutions and organizations, internally and externally
by the National Socialist Party. Its protection
against the world abroad, however, lies in its new National
Socialist armed forces. * * * In this Reich, anybody
who has a responsible position is a National Socialist * * *
Every institution of this Reich is under the orders of the
supreme political leadership * * * The Party leads the
Reich politically, the armed forces defend it militarily
* * * There is nobody in any responsible position in this
state who doubts that I am the authorized leader of this
Reich.” (<span class='it'>2715-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The supreme power which the Leadership Corps exercised over
the German State and Government is sharply pointed up by an
article published in the February 1939 issue of the authoritative
magazine, “<span class='it'>Der Hoheitstrager</span>”. In this article, addressed to all
<span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span>, the Leadership Corps is reminded that it has conquered
the State and that it possesses absolute and total power in
Germany. The article is significantly entitled, “Fight and Order—Not
Peace and Order.” It trumpets forth, in the accents of
Caesarism, the battle call of the Leadership Corps of German
life:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Fight? Why do you always talk of fighting? You have
conquered the State, and if something does not please you,
then just make a law and regulate it differently? Why must
you always talk of fighting? For you have every power!
Over what do you fight? Outer-politically? You have the
Wehrmacht—it will wage the fight if it is required. Inner-politically?
You have the law and the police which can
change everything which does not agree with you.” (<span class='it'>3230-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In view of the domination of the German State and Government
by the Nazi Party and the Leadership Corps thereof, as
established by the foregoing evidence, the Leadership Corps is
responsible for the measures, including legislative enactments,
taken by the German State and Government in furtherance of
the Conspiracy formulated and carried out by the co-conspirators
and the organizations charged with criminality.
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>For example, as revealed by the above evidence, Point 4 of the
original Party Program declared that a Jew was not a member
of the German race and, therefore, was not entitled to citizenship.
This premise was incorporated into the law of the Third
Reich by numerous anti-Semitic and discriminatory laws. Consequently,
it is submitted that, by virtue of their control over the
German State and Government, the Nazi Party and the Leadership
Corps share responsibility for, among other enactments and
measures furthering the Conspiracy, discriminatory laws against
the Jews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Overt Acts and Crimes of the Leadership Corps.</span> The membership
of the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party actively participated
in measures designed to further the progress of the
Conspiracy. The evidence will show that the participation by the
Leadership Corps in the Conspiracy embraces such measures as
anti-Semitic activities, war crimes committed against members
of the Allied forces, the forced labor program, measures to subvert
and undermine the Christian religion and persecute the
Christian clergy, the plundering and spoliation of cultural and
other property in German-occupied territories of Europe, and
plans and measures leading to the initiation and prosecution of
aggressive war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) <span class='it'>Crimes against Jews.</span> The <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> and <span class='it'>Kreisleiter</span> participated
in what were disingenuously described by the Nazis as
the “spontaneous uprising of the people” against the Jews
throughout Germany on 9 and 10 November 1938 in connection
with the assassination of an official of the German Embassy in
Paris on 7 November. (The evidence relating to these programs
is discussed in Chapter XI on the concentration camps, and Chapter
XII on the persecution of the Jews.) It will be recalled that
in the teletyped directive from SS-Gruppenfuehrer Heydrich, issued
on 10 November 1938, to all police headquarters and SD
districts, all chiefs of the State Police were ordered to arrange
with the political leaders in the <span class='it'>Gaue</span> and <span class='it'>Kreise</span> the organization
of the so-called spontaneous demonstrations against the Jews
(<span class='it'>3051-PS</span>). Pursuant to this directive, a large number of Jewish
shops and businesses were pillaged and wrecked, synagogues were
set on fire, individual Jews were beaten up, and large numbers
were taken off to concentration camps. These events forcefully illustrate
the employment and participation of all the <span class='it'>Kreisleiter</span>
and <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> in illegal measures designed to further the anti-Semitic
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>
program, which was an original and continuing objective
of the Leadership Corps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) <span class='it'>Crimes against Allied Airmen.</span> The members of the
Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party participated in the murder,
beating, and ill-treatment of American airmen who landed in
German or German-controlled territory. American airmen who
bailed out of disabled planes over Germany were not treated as
prisoners of war, but were beaten and murdered by German civilians
with the active condonence, indeed at the instigation of the
Leadership Corps. Such a course of conduct by the Leadership
Corps represented a deliberate violation by the German Government
of its obligations, under the Geneva Prisoners of War Convention,
to protect prisoners of war against acts of violence and
ill-treatment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Heinrich Himmler was a <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> of the Nazi Party and thus
a top official in the Leadership Corps by virtue of his positions as
Reichsfuehrer of the SS and Delegate for German Folkdom
(<span class='it'>2473-PS; Chart No. 1</span>). An order signed by Himmler (<span class='it'>R-110</span>),
dated 10 August 1943, reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is not the task of the police to interfere in clashes between
Germans and English and American terror fliers who
have bailed out.” (<span class='it'>R-110</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This order was transmitted in writing to all senior executive SS
and police officers, and orally to their subordinate officers and to
all <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joseph Goebbels was a top-flight official in the Leadership Corps
of the Nazi Party by virtue of his position as Propaganda Leader
of the Party (<span class='it'>2473-PS; Chart No. 1</span>). In the issue of the <span class='it'>Voelkischer
Beobachter</span> for 26/29 May 1944, there appeared an article
written by Goebbels, the <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> for Party Propaganda, in
which he openly invited the German civil population to murder
Allied fliers shot down over Germany (<span class='it'>1676-PS</span>). After alleging
that Anglo-American pilots have engaged in machine gun attacks
against civilians, Goebbels continues:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is only possible with the aid of arms to secure the lives
of enemy pilots who were shot down during such attacks, for
they would otherwise be killed by the sorely tried population.
Who is right here? The murderers who, after their cowardly
misdeeds, await a humane treatment on the part of their victims,
or the victims who wish to defend themselves according
to the principle: ‘An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth’?
This question is not hard to answer.” (<span class='it'>1676-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> Goebbels then proceeds to answer his question in the
following language:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It seems to us hardly possible and tolerable to use German
police and soldiers against the German people when it treats
murderers of children as they deserve.” (<span class='it'>1676-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 30 May 1944, Bormann, <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> and Chief of the Party
Chancellery, issued a circular letter on the subject which furnishes
indisputable proof that British and American fliers who were shot
down were lynched by the German population (<span class='it'>057-PS</span>). After
alleging that in recent weeks English and American fliers had
repeatedly shot children, women, peasants, and vehicles on the
highway, Bormann then states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Several instances have occurred where members of the
crews of such aircraft, who have bailed out or who have
made forced landings, were lynched on the spot immediately
after capture by the populace, which was incensed to the
highest degree. No police measures or criminal proceedings
were invoked against the German civilians who participated
in these incidents.” (<span class='it'>057-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This letter of Bormann was distributed through the chain of command
of the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party. Express mention
on the distribution list is made of <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span>, <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span>,
<span class='it'>Kreisleiter</span>, and leaders of the incorporated and affiliated organizations
of the Party. Bormann requested that the local group
leaders (<span class='it'>Ortsgruppenleiter</span>) be informed of the contents of his
circular letter only by oral means. (<span class='it'>057-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The effect of <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> Bormann’s circular letter may be seen
in an order dated 25 February 1945 (<span class='it'>L-154</span>). This is an order
from Albert Hoffman, an important member of the Leadership
Corps by virtue of his position as <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> and National Defense
Commissioner of the Gau Westfalen-South, and it is addressed
to all County Councillors, mayors, and police officials, and to
county leaders and county staff chiefs of the <span class='it'>Volkssturm</span>. The
order reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Fighter bomber pilots who are shot down are not to be protected
against the fury of the people. I expect from all police
officers that they will refuse to lend their protection to these
gangster types. Authorities acting in contradiction to the
popular sentiment will have to account to me. All police and
gendarmerie officials are to be informed immediately of this,
my attitude.” (<span class='it'>L-154</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The obligations of belligerents towards prisoners of war are
clearly set forth in the Geneva Prisoners of War Convention of
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>
27 July 1929, which was ratified by both Germany and the United
States. Article Two of the Convention provides as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Prisoners of war are in the power of the hostile power, but
not of the individuals or corps who have captured them.</p>

<p>“They must at all times be humanely treated and protected,
particularly against acts of violence, insults and public
curiosity.</p>

<p>“Measures of reprisal against them are prohibited.” (<span class='it'>3738-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The Geneva Prisoners of War Convention clearly imposes upon
its signatories the strict obligation to protect prisoners of war
from violence. The evidence just discussed shows that the German
State flagrantly violated its obligations under that Convention
to protect captured airmen who were shot down in German
hands. The evidence also proves that the entire hierarchy of the
Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party participated in the conspiracy
to incite the German civil population to murder Allied airmen and
also ordered police and Party officials to take no steps to secure
the safety of these airmen.</p>

for the Party Organization, Dr. Ley, concerning a “central inspection

<p class='pindent'>On 17 October 1944, <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> Rosenberg sent a letter to

the latter that he had sent a telegram to <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> urging them
not to interfere in the liquidation of certain listed companies and

that any “delay of liquidation or * * * independent confiscation

<p class='pindent'>On 7 November 1943, the Chief of the General Staff of the

was to give a review of the strategic position at the outset of the
fifth year of war. He stated his realization that the Political
Leaders in the Reich and Gau areas, in view of their burdensome
tasks in supporting the German War Effort, were in need
of information he could give. He stated, in part, as follows:</p>

<p>“<span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> Bormann has requested me to give you a review

The order of the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> states that the question of
treatment of prisoners of war is continually being discussed by

prisoners of war refuse to obey orders to work, the guard has “in

obedience with the weapon if he has no other means. He can use
the weapon as much as is necessary to attain his goal * * *.”

education camps, the young Latvians are trained under Latvian
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>
leaders in the Latvian language not because this is our ideal, but
because absolute military necessity demands this.” Lohse further
stated:</p>

German Leadership and, as military education camps of
the Hitler Youth, they must be a symbol of our educational
mission beyond Germany’s borders * * * I consider the
execution of the military education of the Estonian and Latvian
youth not only a military necessity, but also a war mission
of the Hitler Youth especially. I would be thankful to

itself at our disposal with the same readiness with which
they have so far supported our work in the Baltic area.”

(<span class='it'>D-75</span>). In this decree <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> Bormann flatly declared that
National Socialism and Christianity are incompatible and that
the influence of the churches in Germany must be eliminated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“National Socialist and Christian concepts are irreconcilable.
* * * Our National Socialist ideology is far loftier than
the concepts of Christianity, which, in their essential points,
have been taken over from Jewry. For this reason also, we
do not need Christianity. * * * If, therefore, in the
future our youth learns nothing more of this Christianity,
whose doctrines are far below ours, Christianity will disappear
by itself. * * * It follows from the irreconcilability
of National Socialist and Christian concepts that a
strengthening of existing confessions and every demand of
originating Christian confessions is to be rejected by us. A
differentiation between the various Christian confessions is
not to be made here. For this reason, also, the thought of
an erection of an Evangelical National Church by merger
of the various Evangelical churches has been definitely given
up, because the Evangelical Church is just as inimicable to
us as the Catholic Church. Any strengthening of the Evangelical
Church would merely react against us. * * *</p>

<p>“For the first time in German history, the Fuehrer consciously
and completely has the leadership of the people in
his own hand. With the Party, its components, and attached
units, the Fuehrer has created for himself, and thereby the
German Reich leadership, an instrument which makes him
independent of the Church. All influences which might impair
or damage the leadership of the people exercised by the
Fuehrer, with the help of the NSDAP, must be eliminated.
More and more the people must be separated from the
churches and their organs, the pastors. Of course, the
churches must and will, seen from their viewpoint, defend
themselves against this loss of power. But never again must
an influence on leadership of the people be yielded to the
churches. This influence must be broken completely and
finally.</p>

<p>“Only the Reich Government and, by its direction, the Party,
its components and attached units have a right to leadership
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>
of the people. Just as the deleterious influences of astrologers,
seers and other fakers are eliminated and suppressed
by the State, so must the possibility of Church influence also
be totally removed. Not until this has happened, does the State
leadership have influence on the individual citizens. Not until
then are people and Reich secure in their existence for all the
future.” (<span class='it'>D-75</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 25 April 1941 a letter was issued from Bormann’s office to
Rosenberg, in his capacity as the Fuehrer’s Representative for
the Supervision of the Entire Mental and Ideological Training and
Education of the NSDAP (<span class='it'>070-PS</span>). In this letter Bormann’s
office stated that measures had been taken leading to the progressive
cancellation of morning prayers and other religious services
and their substitution by Nazi mottos and slogans:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“We are inducing schools more and more to reduce and abolish
religious morning services. Similarly the confessional
and general prayers in several parts of the Reich have already
been replaced by national socialist mottos. I would be
grateful, to know your opinion on a future national socialist
morning service instead of the present confessional morning
services which are usually conducted once per week
* * *.” (<span class='it'>070-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In a letter from <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> Bormann to <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> Rosenberg,
dated 22 February 1940, Bormann declared to Rosenberg
that the Christian religion and National Socialism are incompatible
(<span class='it'>098-PS</span>). Bormann cited, as examples of hostile divergence
between Naziism and the churches, the attitude of the latter on
the racial question, celibacy of the priests, monasteries and nunneries,
etc. Bormann further declared that the churches could
not be subjugated through compromise, but only through a new
philosophy of life as prophesied in Rosenberg’s writings. In this
letter, Bormann proposed the creation of a National Socialist
Catechism, in order to give that part of the German youth which
declines to practice confessional religion, a moral foundation, and
to lay a moral basis for National Socialist doctrines, which were
gradually to supplant the Christian religions. Bormann suggested
that some of the Ten Commandments could be merged with the
National Socialist Catechism and stated that a few new Commandments
should be added, such as: Thou shalt be courageous;
Thou shalt not be cowardly; Thou shalt believe in God’s presence
in the living nature, animals, and plants; Thou shalt keep thy
blood pure; etc. Deputy of the Fuehrer Bormann concluded that
he considered the problem so important that it should be discussed
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>
with the members of the Reich Directorate, comprising
the top leaders of the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party, as
soon as possible. (<span class='it'>098-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>At one point in this letter, Bormann stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Christianity and National Socialism are phenomena which
originated from entirely different basic causes. Both differ
fundamentally so strongly, that it will not be possible to construct
a Christian teaching which would be completely compatible
with the point of view of the National Socialist ideology;
just as the communications of Christian faith would
never be able to stand by the ideology of National Socialism
in its entirety * * *.” (<span class='it'>098-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>After discussing various proposals for the formulation of a Nazi
religious credo for instruction in the German school system, Bormann
stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Fuehrer’s deputy finds it necessary that all these questions
should be thoroughly discussed in the near future in the
presence of the Reich Leaders [<span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span>] who are especially
effected by them * * *.” (<span class='it'>098-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In a circular letter, dated 17 June 1938, addressed by Bormann
as <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> and Deputy of the Fuehrer to all <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> and
<span class='it'>Gauleiter</span>, there was enclosed a copy of rules prepared by <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span>
Hierl, setting forth certain restrictive regulations with respect
to participation of the Reich Labor Service in religious celebrations
(<span class='it'>107-PS</span>). Pertinent portions of the directives issued
by <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> Hierl read as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Reich Labor Service is a training school in which the
German youth should be educated to national unity in the
spirit of National Socialism * * *.</p>

<p>“What religious beliefs a person has is not a decisive factor,
but it is decisive that he first of all feels himself a German.</p>

<p>“Every religious practice is forbidden in the Reich Labor
Service because it disturbs the comradelike harmony of all
working men and women.</p>

<p>“On this basis, every participation of the Reich Labor Service
in churchly, that is religious, arrangements and celebrations
is not possible.” (<span class='it'>107-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The position of Bormann as Deputy of the Fuehrer and chief
of the Nazi Party Chancellery, and the position of Rosenberg as
the Fuehrer’s Representative for the Whole Spiritual and Philosophical
Education of the Nazi Party, give to the foregoing views
on religion and religious policy the highest official backing. The
anti-Christian utterances and policies of these two conspirator-defendants
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>
reveal a community of mind and intention amongst
the most powerful leaders of the party which was amply confirmed
by the actual treatment of the churches since 1933 and
throughout the course of the conspiracy. An excerpt from page
514 of “The Myth of the 20th Century,” written by Rosenberg,
reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The idea of honor—national honor—is for us the beginning
and the end of our entire thinking and doing. It does
not admit of any equal-valued center of force along side of
it, no matter of what kind, neither Christian love, nor the
Free-Masonic humanity, nor the Roman philosophy.” (<span class='it'>2349-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to promoting beliefs and practices fundamentally
incompatible with Christianity, the Leadership Corps participated
in the persecution of priests, clergy, and members of religious
orders. A Gestapo telegram, dated 24 July 1938, dispatched from
Berlin to Nurnberg, deals with demonstrations and acts of violence
against Bishop Sproll in Rottenburg (<span class='it'>848-PS</span>). The Gestapo
office in Berlin wired its Nurnberg office the following teletype
account received from its Stuttgart office of disorderly conduct
and vandalism carried out by Nazi Party members against
Bishop Sproll:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Party on 23 July 1939 from 2100 on carried out the
third demonstration against Bishop Sproll. Participants,
about 2500-3000, were brought in from outside by bus, etc.
The Rottenburg populace again did not participate in the
demonstration. This town took rather hostile attitude toward
the demonstrations. The action got completely out of hand
of the Party member responsible for it. The demonstrators
stormed the palace, beat in the gates and doors. About 150
to 200 people forced their way into the palace, searched
through the rooms, threw files out of the windows and rummaged
through the beds in the rooms of the palace. One bed
was ignited * * * The Bishop was with Archbishop
Groeber of Freiburg and the ladies and gentlemen of his
menage in the chapel at prayer. About 25 to 30 people
pressed into this chapel and molested those present. Bishop
Groeber was taken for Bishop Sproll. He was grabbed by
the robe and dragged back and forth * * *.” (<span class='it'>848-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The Gestapo official in Stuttgart added that Bishop Groeber desired
“to turn to the Fuehrer and Reich Minister of the Interior,
Dr. Frick, anew”; and that he had found a full report of the demonstration
after “suppressing counter mass meetings.” (<span class='it'>848-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 23 July 1938 the Reich Minister for Church Affairs, Kerrl,
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>
sent a letter to the Minister of State and Chief of the Praesidium
Chancellery, Berlin, stating that Bishop Sproll had angered the
population by abstaining from the plebiscite of 10 April (<span class='it'>849-PS</span>).
In this letter Kerrl stated that the <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> and Governor
of Wuerttemberg had decided that, in the interest of preserving
the State’s authority and in the interest of quiet and order, Bishop
Sproll could no longer remain in office. The letter reads in part
as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * The Reich Governor had explained to the Ecclesiastical
Board that he would no longer regard Bishop Sproll
as Head of the Diocese of Rottenburg on account of his refraining
from the election in the office and that he desired
Bishop Sproll to leave the Gau area * * * because he
could assume no guarantee for his personal safety; that in
the case of the return of the Bishop of Rottenburg he would
see to it that all personal and official intercourse with him on
the part of State offices as well as Party offices and the
Armed Forces would be denied.” (<span class='it'>849-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Kerrl further stated in the foregoing letter that his Deputy
had moved the Foreign Office, through the German Embassy at
the Vatican, to urge the Holy See to persuade Bishop Sproll to
resign his Bishopric. Kerrl concluded by stating that should the
effort to procure the Bishop’s resignation prove unsuccessful</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * the Bishop would have to be exiled from the land
or there would have to be a complete boycott of the Bishop
by the authorities * * *.” (<span class='it'>849-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 14 July 1939 Bormann, in his capacity as Deputy of the
Fuehrer, issued a party regulation which required party members
entering the clergy or undertaking the study of theology to
leave the party (<span class='it'>840-PS</span>). The last paragraph of the regulation
reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I decree that in the future party members who enter the
clergy or who turn to the study of theology have to leave the
party.” (<span class='it'>840-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In this directive Bormann also referred to an earlier decree,
dated 9 February 1937, in which he had ruled that the admission
of members of the clergy into the party was to be avoided. In that
decree also Bormann referred with approval to a regulation of
the Reich Treasurer of the NSDAP, dated 10 May 1939, providing
that—</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“clergymen, as well as other fellow Germans, who are also
closely connected with the church, cannot be admitted into
the party.” (<span class='it'>840-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Allocution of His Holiness, Pope Pius XII, to the Sacred
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>
College on 2 June 1945, His Holiness, after declaring that he had
acquired an appreciation of the great qualities of the German
people in the course of 12 years of residence in their midst, expressed
the hope that Germany could rise to new dignity and new
life once it had laid the satanic specter raised by National Socialism,
and after the guilty had expiated the crimes they have
committed (<span class='it'>3268-PS</span>). After referring to repeated violations by
the German government of the Concordat concluded in 1933, His
Holiness declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The struggle against the Church did, in fact, become ever
more bitter: there was the dissolution of Catholic organizations;
the gradual suppression of the flourishing Catholic
schools, both public and private; the enforced weaning of
youth from family and Church; the pressure brought to bear
on the conscience of citizens, and especially of civil servants;
the systematic defamation, by means of a clever, closely-organized
propaganda, of the Church, the clergy, the faithful,
the Church’s institutions, teachings and history; the closing,
dissolution, confiscation of religious houses and other ecclesiastical
institutions; the complete suppression of the Catholic
press and publishing houses * * *.</p>

<p>“In the meantime the Holy See itself multiplied its representations
and protests to governing authorities in Germany,
reminding them, in clear and energetic language, of their
duty to respect and fulfill the obligations of the natural law
itself that were confirmed by the Concordat. In those critical
years, joining the alert vigilance of a Pastor to the long-suffering
patience of a father, Our great Predecessor Pius
XI fulfilled his mission as Supreme Pontiff with intrepid
courage.</p>

<p>“But when, after he had tried all means of persuasion in
vain, he saw himself clearly faced with deliberate violations
of a solemn pact, with a religious persecution masked or
open, but always rigorously organized, he proclaimed to the
world, on Passion Sunday 1937, in his Encyclical <span class='it'>Mit brennender
Sorge</span>, what National-Socialism really was; the arrogant
apostasy from Jesus Christ, the denial of His doctrine
and of His work of redemption, the cult of violence, the
idolatry of race and blood, the overthrow of human liberty
and dignity * * *.</p>

<p>“From the prisons, concentration camps and fortresses are
now pouring out, together with the political prisoners, also
the crowds of those, whether clergy or laymen, whose only
crime was their fidelity to Christ and to the faith of their
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>
fathers or the dauntless fulfillment of their duties as priests
* * *.</p>

<p>“In the forefront, the number and harshness of the treatment
meted out to them, were the Polish priests. From 1940
to 1945, 2,800 Polish ecclesiastica and religious were imprisoned
in that camp; among them was the Auxiliary bishop of
Wloclawek, who died there of typhus. In April last there
were left only 816, all the others being dead except for two
or three transferred to another camp. In the summer of
1942, 480 German-speaking ministers of religion were
known to be gathered there; of these, 45 were Protestants,
all the others Catholic priests. In spite of the continuous inflow
of new internees, especially from some dioceses of Bavaria,
Rhenania and Westphalia, their number, as a result of
the high rate of mortality, at the beginning of this year, did
not surpass 350. Nor should we pass over in silence those
belonging to occupied territories, Holland, Belgium, France
(among whom the Bishop of Clermont), Luxembourg, Slovenia,
Italy. Many of those priests and laymen endured indescribable
sufferings for their faith and for their vocation.
In one case the hatred of the impious against Christ reached
the point of parodying on the person of an interned priest,
with barbed wire, the scourging and crowning with thorns
of our Redeemer.” (<span class='it'>3268-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Leadership Corps participated in the confiscation of church
and religious property. A letter dated 19 April 1941 from <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span>
Bormann to <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> Rosenberg exposes the participation
of the <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> in measures relating to the confiscation of
religious property (<span class='it'>072-PS</span>). The letter reads in part as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The libraries and art objects of the monasteries confiscated
in the Reich were to remain for the time being in these monasteries,
insofar as the Gauleiter had not determined otherwise.”
(<span class='it'>072-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 21 February 1940, the Chief of the Security Police and SD,
Heydrich, wrote a letter to the Reichsfuehrer SS, Himmler, proposing
that certain listed churches and monasteries be confiscated
for the accommodation of so-called racial Germans. (Himmler
was a <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> in the Leadership Corps by virtue of his position
as Reichsfuehrer of the SS.) After pointing out that, on political
grounds, outright expropriation of religious property
would not be feasible at the time, Heydrich suggested certain specious
interim actions with respect to the church properties in
question, to be followed progressively by outright confiscation
(<span class='it'>R-101-A</span>). Heydrich’s letter makes the following statements:
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Enclosed is a list of church possessions which might be
available for the accommodation of Racial Germans. The
list, which please return, is supplemented by correspondence
and illustrated material pertinent to the subject.</p>

<p>“For political reasons, expropriation without indemnity of
the entire property of the churches and religious orders will
hardly be possible at this time.</p>

<p>“Expropriation with indemnity or in return for assignment
of other lands and grounds will be even less possible.</p>

<p>“It is therefore suggested that the respective authorities of
the Orders be instructed that they make available the monasteries
concerned for the accommodation of Racial Germans
and remove their own members to other less populous monasteries.
[Marginal note in pencil opposite this paragraph:
“Very good!”]</p>

<p>“The final expropriation of these properties thus placed at
our disposal can then be carried out step by step in course of
time.” (<span class='it'>R-101-A</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 5 April 1940, the Chief of the Security Police and of the Security
Service SS sent a letter to the Reich Commissioner for the
consolidation of Germandom, enclosing a copy of the foregoing
letter from Heydrich to Himmler proposing the confiscation of
church properties (<span class='it'>R-101-A</span>). The letter of 5 April 1940 stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Reich Leader SS has agreed to the proposals made in
the enclosed letter and has ordered the matter to be dealt
with by collaboration between the Chief of the Security Police
and Security Service and your office.” (<span class='it'>R-101-A</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A letter dated 30 July 1941 (<span class='it'>R-101-C</span>) written by an SS-Standartenfuehrer
whose signature is illegible, to the Reich Leader of
the SS, supplies further evidence of the participation of the <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span>
in the seizure of church property:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Further to report of 30 May 1941 this office considers it its
duty to call the Reich Leader’s attention to the development
which is currently taking place in the incorporated Eastern
countries with regard to seizure and confiscation of Church
property.</p>

<p>“As soon as the Reich Laws on expropriation had been introduced,
the Reich Governor and <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> in the Wartheland
adopted the practice of expropriating real estate belonging
to churches for use as dwellings. He grants compensation to
the extent of the assessed value and pays the equivalent
amount into blocked accounts.</p>

<p>“Moreover the East German Estate Administration Limited
reports that in the ‘<span class='it'>Warthegau</span>’ all real estate owned by the
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>
churches is being claimed by the local <span class='it'>Gau</span> administration
[<span class='it'>Gauselbstverwaltung</span>].” (<span class='it'>R-101-C</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Another letter, this one from the Chief of the Staff Main Office
to Himmler, dated 30 March 1942, dealing with the confiscation of
church property, evidences the active participation of the Party
Chancellery in the confiscation of religious property (<span class='it'>R-101-D</span>).
In this letter the Chief of the Staff Main Office reports to Himmler
concerning the policy of the SS in suspending all payments of
rent to monasteries and other church institutions whose property
had been expropriated. The letter discusses a proposal made by
the Reich Minister of the Interior, in which the Party Chancery
prominently participated, to the effect that the church institutions
should be paid amounts corresponding to current mortgage
charges on the premises without realizing any profit. The writer
further suggests that such payments should never be made directly
to the ecclesiastical institutions but rather should be made
to the creditors of such institutions:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Such an arrangement would be in line with the basic idea
of the settlement originally worked out between the Party
Chancery and the Reich Minister of the Interior.” (<span class='it'>R-101-D</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party participated in the suppression
of religious publications and interfered with free religious
education. In a letter dated 27 September 1940, <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span>
and Deputy of the Fuehrer Bormann transmitted to Rosenberg
a photostatic copy of a letter from <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> Florian to Hess,
dated 23 September 1940, which expresses the <span class='it'>Gauleiter’s</span> intense
disapproval on Nazi ideological grounds of a religious pamphlet
entitled “The Spirit and Soul of the Soldiers,” written by a Major
General von Rabenau (<span class='it'>064-PS</span>). The <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> urges that the
religious writings of General von Rabenau be suppressed. Florian
also discusses a conversation he had with General von Rabenau at
the close of a lecture delivered by the General to a group of
younger Army officers at Aachen. This conversation illumines the
hostile attitude of the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party toward
the Christian churches:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“After he had affirmed the necessity of the churches, Rabenau
said, with emphasized self-assurance, something like the following:
‘Dear Gauleiter, the Party is making mistake after
mistake in the business with the churches. Obtain for me the
necessary powers from the Fuehrer and I guarantee that I
shall succeed in a few months in establishing peace with the
churches for all times.’ After this catastrophic ignorance, I
gave up the conversation. Dear Party Member Hess: the
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>
reading of von Rabenau’s pamphlet ‘Spirit and Soul of the
Soldier’ has reminded me again of this. In this brochure,
Rabenau affirms the necessity of the Church straight-forward
and clearly, even if it is prudently careful. He writes on
page 28 ‘There could be more examples; they would suffice
to show that a soldier in this world can scarcely get along
without thoughts about the next one.’ Because von Rabenau
is falsely based spiritually, I consider his activities as an
educator in spiritual affairs as dangerous, and I am of the
opinion that his educational writings are to be dispensed with
absolutely and that the publication section of the NSDAP
can and must renounce these writings * * * The churches
with their Christianity are this danger against which the
struggle must always be carried on.” (<span class='it'>064-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That the Party Chancellery shared the <span class='it'>Gauleiter’s</span> hostility to
the Christian churches is further revealed by Bormann’s instruction
to Rosenberg to “take action” on the <span class='it'>Gauleiter’s</span> recommendation
that the General’s writings be suppressed. (<span class='it'>064-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another letter from Bormann to Rosenberg, dated 8 March
1940, enclosed a copy of Bormann’s letter of the same date to
<span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> Amann (<span class='it'>089-PS</span>). Amann was a top member of the
Leadership Corps by virtue of his position as <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> for the
Press and Leader of the Party Publishing Company. In this letter
to Amann, Bormann expressed his dismay and dissatisfaction
that only 10 percent of the 3,000 Protestant periodicals in Germany
had ceased publication for what are described as “paper
saving” reasons. Bormann then advised Amann that “the distribution
of any paper whatsoever for such periodicals” was barred
(<span class='it'>089-PS</span>). Bormann also instructed Amann to make sharper restrictions
in the distribution of paper against religious writings
in favor of publications more acceptable to the Nazi ideology:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I urge you [Bormann is addressing <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> Amann] to
see to it in any redistribution of paper to be considered later
that the confessional writing, which according to experiences
so far gathered possesses very doubtful value for strengthening
the power of resistance of the people toward the external
foe receives still sharper restrictions in favor of literature,
politically and ideologically more valuable.” (<span class='it'>089-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A further letter from Bormann to Rosenberg, dated 17 January
1940, expressed the Party’s opposition to the circulation of religious
literature to the members of the German Armed Forces
(<span class='it'>101-PS</span>). Pertinent excerpts from Bormann’s letter read as
follows:
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Nearly all the districts [<span class='it'>Gaue</span>] report to me regularly that
the churches of both confessions are administering spiritually
to members of the Armed Forces. This administering
finds its expression especially in the fact that soldiers are
being sent religious publications by the spiritual leaders of
the home congregations. These publications are, in part,
very cleverly composed. I have repeated reports that these
publications are being read by the troops and thereby exercise
a certain influence on the morale.</p>

<p>“I have, in the past, sought by sounding out the General
Field Marshal, the High Command of the Armed Forces, and
* * * Reich Director Amann, to restrict considerably
the production and shipment of publications of this type.
The result of these efforts remains unsatisfactory. As
<span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> Amann has repeatedly informed me, the restriction
of these pamphlets by means of the * * * paper
rationing has not been achieved because the paper * * *
is being purchased on the open market.</p>

<p>“If the influencing of the soldiers by the church is to be
effectively combatted, this will only be accomplished by
producing many good publications in the shortest possible
time under the supervision of the Party * * *.</p>

<p>“Thus at the last meeting of the Deputy <span class='it'>Gauleiters</span>, comments
were uttered on this matter to the effect that a considerable
quantity of such publications are not available.</p>

<p>“I maintain that it is necessary that in the near future we
transmit to the Party Service Office down to <span class='it'>Ortsgruppenleitern</span>
a list of additional publications of this sort which
should be sent to our soldiers by the <span class='it'>Ortsgruppen</span>. * * *”

<p class='pindent'>The Leadership Corps also participated in measures leading
to the closing and dissolution of theological schools and other religious
institutions. In a letter dated 17 April 1939 Bormann
transmitted to Rosenberg photostatic copy of a plan suggested
by the Reich Minister for Science, Education, and Training for
the combining and closing of certain specifically listed theological
faculties (<span class='it'>122-PS</span>). In his letter of transmittal Bormann requested
Rosenberg to take “cognizance and prompt action” with
respect to proposed suppression of religious institutions. The
plan to suppress the religious institutions was summarized as
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“To recapitulate, this plan would include the complete closing
of the theological faculties at Innsbruck, Salzburg, and
Munich, the transfer of the faculty of Graz to Vienna, and
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>
the vanishing of four Catholic faculties; closing of three
Catholic theological faculties or higher schools, and of four
evangelical faculties in the Winter semester 1939/1940;
closing of one further Catholic and of three further evangelical
faculties in the near future.” (<span class='it'>122-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A final letter from Bormann to Rosenberg, dated 24 January
1939, enclosed for Rosenberg’s cognizance a copy of Bormann’s
letter to the Reich Minister for Knowledge and Education (<span class='it'>116-PS</span>).
In the enclosed letter, Bormann informed the Minister as
to the Party’s position in favor of restricting and suppressing
theological faculties. Bormann stated that, owing to the effects
of the introduction of military service, the consequences of the
Four Year Plan, and the extraordinary lack of replacements, it
would become necessary to carry out a reorganization of the
German high schools. In view of these developments, he requested
the Minister to restrict and suppress the theological
faculties:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * I would appreciate it very much if you would
restrict the theological faculties in so far as they cannot be
wholly suppressed in accordance with the above statement.
I request in this instance the omission of any expressed
declaration to the Churches or to other places, as well as
the avoiding of a public announcement of these measures.
Complaints and the like must be answered (if they are to
be replied to) in the fashion that these measures are being
executed in the course of the economic plan of reorganization
and that similar things are happening to other faculties.</p>

<p>“I would appreciate it very much if professional chairs thus
vacated can be then turned over to the newly created fields
of inquiry of these last years, such as Racial Research,
Archeological Studies, etc.” (<span class='it'>116-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the foregoing evidence it is clear the Leadership Corps
of the Nazi Party shares in the responsibility for the measures
taken to subvert the Christian churches and persecute the Christian
clergy, both in Germany and in German-occupied territories
of Europe. The Prosecution stresses the significance of the appointment
of Rosenberg, whose anti-Christian views are open
and notorious, as the Fuehrer’s Representative for the Whole
Spiritual and Philosophical Education of the Nazi Party. It was
precisely this position which gave Rosenberg his seat in the
<span class='it'>Reichsleitung</span>. But emphasis is placed not merely upon the fact
that anti-Christs such as Bormann and Rosenberg held directive
positions within the Leadership Corps, but upon the further
fact that their directives and orders were passed down the chain
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>
of command of the Leadership Corps and caused the participation
of its membership in acts subversive of the Christian Church.</p>

Control over the Productive Labor Capacity of Germany.</span> The
evidence relating to the destruction of the independent trade

hereinafter taken up is offered to prove the responsibility of the
Leadership Corps for participation in the smashing of the unions
and the imposition of Nazi Party control over the productive
labor capacity of the German nation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after the seizure of power (mid-April 1933), <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span>
Robert Ley was directed by Hitler to smash the independent
unions. <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> Ley, in his speech to the Nurnberg Party
Congress of 1936, declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * My Fuehrer! When you, my Fuehrer, ordered
me in mid-April 1933 to take over the trade unions, I could
not understand why you gave this order to me since I could
not see any connection between my task as Organizational
Leader of the Party and my new task. Very soon, however,
your decision, my Fuehrer, became clear to me and I recognized
that the organizational measures of the Party could
only come to full fruition when supplemented by the organization
of the people, that is to say, by the mobilization of the
energies of the people and by their concentration and alignment.
If the <span class='it'>Party</span> represents the <span class='it'>concentration of the Political
Leaders of the people</span>—as you, my Fuehrer, have told us
again and again—then the <span class='it'>people</span> is the <span class='it'>retinue</span> and must be
organized and trained according to the same principles.
<span class='it'>Leader and retinue, elite and community at large</span>—these were
the clear directives for my work. These were the consequences:</p>

<p>“(1) <span class='it'>My tasks as Organizational Leader of the Party and
as the leader of the German Labor Front were a completely
homogeneous task: in other words, in everything I did I
acted as Reich Organization Leader of the NSDAP.</span></p>

<p>“(2) <span class='it'>The German Labor Front was an institution of the
Party and was led by it.</span></p>

<p>“(3) <span class='it'>The German Labor Front had to be organized regionally
and professionally according to the same principles as the
Party.</span></p>

<p>“That is why trade union and employer associations had to
be smashed unrelentingly, and the basis of construction was
formed, as in the Party, by the cell and the local section
[<span class='it'>Ortsgruppe</span>].</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>In furtherance of the Nazi policy to destroy the independent
trade unions of Germany, Ley issued a Party directive on 21 April
1933 outlining what was termed a “coordination action” scheduled
for 2 May 1933 against the General German Trade Union
Federation and the General Independent Employee Federation
(<span class='it'>392-PS</span>). This directive ordered the SA and the SS to occupy
trade union premises, seize trade union funds, and take into protective
custody the higher union leaders.</p>

<p class='noindent'>Pertinent portions of Ley’s order provide:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Ley’s order for the dissolution of the independent trade unions
was carried out as planned and directed. Trade union premises
all over Germany were occupied by the SA and the unions dissolved.
On 2 May 1933, the official NSDAP Press Service reported
that the National Socialist Factory Cells Organization
(NSBO) had “eliminated the old leadership” of “Free Trade
Unions” and taken over their leadership (<span class='it'>2224-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“National Socialism, which today has assumed leadership of
the German working class, can no longer bear the responsibility
for leaving the men and women of the German working
class, the members of the largest trade organization in
the world, the German Trade Union Movement, in the hands
of a people who do not know a fatherland that is called Germany.
Because of that, the National Socialist Factory Cell
Organization (NSBO) has taken over the leadership of the
trade unions. The NSBO has eliminated the old leadership
of the trade unions of the General German Trade Unions
League and of the General Independent Employees’ Federation
* * *.</p>

<p>“On 2 May 1933, the National Socialist Factory Cell Organization
(NSBO) took over the leadership of all trade unions;
all trade union buildings were occupied and most stringent
control has been organized over financial and personnel matters
of the organization.” (<span class='it'>2224-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This assault on the independent unions directed by Ley in his
capacity as <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> in charge of Party Organization, assisted
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>
by the <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span>, and Party Formations, included the seizure of
trade union funds and property. In a speech on 11 September
1937 to the 5th Annual Session of the German Labor Front
(<span class='it'>1678-PS</span>), Ley admitted the confiscation of trade union funds.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Once I said to the Fuehrer: ‘My Fuehrer, actually I am standing
with one foot in jail, for today I am still the trustee of
the comrades “Leipart” and “Imbusch,” and should they some
day ask me to return their money, then it will be found that
I have spent it, either by building things, or otherwise. But
they shall never again find their property in the condition in
which they handed it over to me. Therefore I would have to
be convicted.’</p>

<p>“The Fuehrer laughed then and remarked that apparently I
felt extremely well in this condition.</p>

<p>“It was very difficult for us all. Today we laugh about it
* * *.” (<span class='it'>1678-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The plan of the Nazi conspirators to eliminate the Free Trade
Unions was advanced by the enactment on 19 May 1933 of a law
which abolished collective bargaining between workers and employers
and replaced it with a regulation of working conditions
by Labor Trustees appointed by Hitler (<span class='it'>405-PS</span>). After providing
in Section 1 for the appointment by Hitler of trustees of
labor, this law provides, in Section 2:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Until a new revision of the social constitution, the trustees
are to regulate the conditions for the conclusion of labor
contracts. This practice is to be legally binding for all persons
and replaces the system found on combinations of
workers, of individual employers or of combinations of employers
* * *.”(<span class='it'>405-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Having destroyed the independent unions and collective bargaining,
the next step of the Nazi conspirators was to Nazify industrial
relations. The Law of 20 January 1934, entitled “Law
Regulating National Labor,” imposed the Leadership Principle
upon industrial enterprisers (<span class='it'>1861-PS</span>). Section I, paragraph 1,
provided that the enterpriser should be the leader of the plant
and the workers would “constitute his followers.” Section 1, paragraph
2 reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Leader of the plant makes the decisions for the employees
and laborers in all matters concerning the enterprise,
as far as they are regulated by this law.</p>

<p>“He is responsible for the well-being of the employees and
laborers. The employees and laborers owe him faithfulness
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>
according to the principles of the factory community.”
(<span class='it'>1861-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The trade unions having been dissolved and the Leadership
Principle superimposed upon the relationship of management and
labor, the members of the Leadership Corps joined in and directed
measures designed to replace the independent unions by the German
Labor Front, the DAF, an affiliated Party organization. On
the very day the Nazi conspirators seized and dissolved the Free
Trade Unions, 2 May 1933, they publicly proclaimed that a
“united front of German workers” would be formed with Hitler
as honorary patron at a workers’ congress on 10 May 1933 (<span class='it'>2224-PS</span>).
A release of the Nazi Party Press Agency stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The National Socialist Party Press Agency is informed that
a great workers’ congress will take place on Wednesday, 10
May, in the Russian House of Lords in Berlin. The United
Front of German workers will be formed there. Adolf Hitler
will be asked to assume the position of Honorary Patron.”
(<span class='it'>2224-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The action committee, which supervised the smashing of the
unions under <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> Ley, met with Hitler and reported that
the independent unions had been effectively dissolved. The Fuehrer
then consented to be Honorary Patron at the Great Workers’
Congress. (<span class='it'>2224-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party was not only employed
in measures taken to dissolve the independent unions, but certain
of its members were given important and directive positions
within the German Labor Front, the Nazi Organization which replaced
the free trade unions. On 10 May 1933, Hitler appointed
Ley Leader of the German Labor Front (DAF) (<span class='it'>1940-PS</span>). By
the same edict, Hitler appointed <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> Forster as Leader of
the Employees’ Associations, and Schumann, Leader of the Nazi
Factory Cell Organization (NSBO), as Leader of the Workers’
Associations. The Hitler edict stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Fuehrer, Adolf Hitler, has issued the following edict:</p>

<p>“I appoint the Chief of Staff of the Political Organization of
the NSDAP, Dr. Robert Ley, as leader of the German Labor
Front.</p>

<p>“I appoint <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> Forster, Danzig, as leader of the Employees’
Associations.</p>

<p>“I appoint the leader of the National Socialist Factory Cell
Organizations (NSBO), Schumann, as leader of the Workers’
Associations.</p>

<p><span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi conspirators employed the German Labor Front
(DAF) as an instrument for propagandizing its millions of compulsory
members with Nazi ideology. The control of the Leadership
Corps over the German Labor Front was assured not only
by the designation of <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> Ley as head of the DAF, but by
the employment of a large number of <span class='it'>Politischen Leiter</span> (political
leaders) charged with disseminating Nazi ideology to the large
membership of the DAF. These facts are apparent from pages
185-187 of the <span class='it'>Organization Book of the NSDAP</span> (<span class='it'>2271-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The National Socialist Factory Cells Organization [NSBO],
is a union of the political leaders [<span class='it'>Politischen Leiter</span>] of the
NSDAP in the German Labor Front.</p>

<p>“The NSBO is the carrier of the organization of the German
Labor Front.</p>

<p>“The duties and responsibilities of the NSBO have passed
over to the DAF.</p>

<p>“The political leaders who have been transferred from the
NSBO to the German Labor Front guarantee the ideological
education of the DAF in the spirit of the National Socialistic
idea.” (<span class='it'>2271-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The foregoing evidence fixes upon the Leadership Corps of the
Nazi Party responsibility for participation in the measures leading
to the destruction of the independent trade unions and to
Nazi Party control over the productive capacity of the German
Labor Movement. Not only were these actions directed by Ley
in his capacity as <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span>, but they were supervised on a
regional basis by the <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> as district representatives of the
Leadership Corps. Moreover, the German Labor Front (DAF)
which replaced the dissolved trade unions was an affiliated organization
of the NSDAP and, as such, remained under the control
of the Leadership Corps and was employed by it to nazify the
labor population of Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>f</span>) <span class='it'>Plunder of Art Treasures.</span> The Leadership Corps of the
NSDAP is also responsible for the plundering of art treasures

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg91a'>3. THE REICH CABINET</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The Reich Cabinet, or <span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span>, unlike most of the
other Nazi organizations, was not especially created by the Nazi
Party to carry out or implement its purposes. The <span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span>
had, before the Nazis came to power, a place in the constitutional
and political history of the country. As with other cabinets
of duly constituted governments, the executive power of the realm
was concentrated in that body. The Nazi conspirators well realized
this fact. Their aim for totalitarian control over the State
could not be secured, they realized, except by acquiring, holding,
and utilizing the machinery of the State. And this they did.
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>
Under the Nazi regime the <span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span> gradually became a
primary agent of the Nazi Party, with functions and policies
formulated in accordance with the objectives and methods of the
Party itself. The <span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span> became—at first gradually
and then with more rapidity—polluted by the infusion of the
Nazi conspirators sixteen of whom are accused in the Indictment.
Its purpose came to be to clothe every scheme and purpose of the
Party, however vile, with the semblance of legality.</p>

<h3>A. <span class='it'>Composition and Nature of the Reichsregierung.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>The term <span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span> literally translated means “Reich
Government”. Actually, it was commonly taken to refer to the
ordinary Reich Cabinet. In the Indictment the term <span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span>
is defined to include not only those persons who were
members of the ordinary Reich Cabinet, but also persons who
were members of the Council of Ministers for the Defense of the
Reich (<span class='it'>Ministerrat fuer die Reichsverteidigung</span>) and the Secret
Cabinet Council (<span class='it'>Geheimer Kabinettsrat</span>). The most important
body, however, was the ordinary cabinet. Between it and the
other two groups there was in reality only an artificial distinction.
There existed, in fact, a unity of personnel, action, function,
and purpose that obliterated any academic separation. As
used in the Indictment, the term “ordinary cabinet” means Reich
Ministers, i.e., heads of departments of the central government;
Reich Ministers without portfolio; State Ministers acting as
Reich Ministers; and other officials entitled to take part in Cabinet
meetings. Altogether, 48 persons held positions in the ordinary
cabinet. 17 of them have been indicted as defendants. Of
the remaining 31, eight are believed to be dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>The Ordinary Cabinet.</span> Into the ordinary cabinet were
placed the leading Nazi trusted henchmen. Then, when new governmental
agencies or bodies were created, either by Hitler or
by the Cabinet itself, the constituents of these new bodies were
taken from the rolls of the ordinary cabinet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the first Hitler Cabinet was formed on 30 January 1933,
there were 10 ministries which could be classified as departments
of the central government. This fact appears from the minutes
of the first meeting of that cabinet, which were found in the files
of the Reich Chancellery and bear the typed signature of one
Weinstein, who is described in the minutes as “Responsible for
the Protocol—Counsellor in the Ministry” (<span class='it'>351-PS</span>). The ten
ministers who attended are set forth:
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Reichs Minister of Foreign Affairs (von Neurath); Reichs
Minister of the Interior (Frick); Reichs Minister of Finance
(Graf Schwerin von Krosigk); Reichs Minister of Economy;
Reichs Minister for Food and Agriculture (Dr. Hugenberg);
Reichs Minister of Labor (Seldte); Reichs Minister of Justice
[no name given; the post was filled two days later by
Gurtner]; Reichs Defense Minister (von Blomberg); the
Reichs Postmaster General; and Reichs Minister for Transportation
(Freiherr von Eltz-Ruebanach).” (<span class='it'>351-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In addition, Goering attended as Reichs Minister (he held no
portfolio at that time) and Reichs Commissar for Aviation. Dr.
Perecke attended as Reich Commissar for Procurement of Labor.
Two state secretaries were present—Dr. Lammers of the Reichs
Chancellery and Dr. Meissner of the Reich’s Presidential Chancellery.
In addition, Funk was present as Reichs Press Chief,
and von Papen was present as Deputy of the Reichs Chancellor
and Reichs Commissar for the State of Prussia. (<span class='it'>351-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not long afterwards new ministries or departments were created,
into which leading Nazi figures were placed. On 13 March
1933, the Ministry of Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda
was created, and Paul Josef Goebbels was named as Reich Minister
of Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda (<span class='it'>2029-PS</span>). On
5 May 1933 the Ministry of Air (<span class='it'>2089-PS</span>), on 1 May 1934 the
Ministry of Education (<span class='it'>2078-PS</span>), and on 16 July 1935 the Ministry
for Church Affairs (<span class='it'>2090-PS</span>) were created. Goering was
made Air Minister; Bernhard Rust, Gauleiter of South Hanover,
was named Education Minister; and Hans Kerrl was named
Minister for Church Affairs. Two Ministries were added after
the war started. On 17 March 1940 the Ministry of Armaments
and Munitions was established (<span class='it'>2091-PS</span>). Dr. Fritz Todt, a
high party official, was appointed to this post. Speer succeeded
him. The name of this department was changed to “Armaments
and War Production” in 1943 (<span class='it'>2092-PS</span>). On 17 July 1941, when
the seizure of Eastern territories was in progress, the Ministry
for the Occupied Eastern Territories was created. There was no
published decree for this act. A file found in the Presidential
Chancellery contains a typewritten copy of the decree of Hitler
establishing that post (<span class='it'>1997-PS</span>). The decree provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Decree of the Fuehrer concerning the administration of
the newly-occupied Eastern Territories dated 17 July 1941.”</p>

<p>“In order to maintain public order and public life in the
newly-occupied Eastern territories I decree that:</p>

<p>“As soon as the military operations in the newly-occupied
territories are over, the administration of these territories
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>
shall be transferred from the military establishments to the
civil-administration establishments. I shall from time to time
determine by special decree, the territories which according
to this are to be transferred to the civil administration
and the time when this is to take place.</p>

<p>“The Civil Administration in the newly occupied Eastern
territories, where these territories are not included in the
administration of the territories bordering on the Reich or
the General government, is subject to the ‘Reich Minister
for the Occupied Eastern territories.’</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“I appoint Reichsleiter Alfred Rosenberg as Reich Minister
for the Occupied Eastern Territories. He will hold office in
Berlin.” (<span class='it'>1997-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>During the years 1933 to 1945, one ministry was dropped—the
Ministry of Defense (later called War). This took place on
4 February 1938, when Hitler took over command of the whole
Armed Forces. At the same time he created the office of the
“Chief of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces” or Chief
of the OKW. This was held by Keitel. The decree accomplishing
this change provides in part as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“He [the Chief of the supreme command of the armed
forces] is equal in rank to a Reich Minister. At the same
time, the supreme command takes the responsibility for the
affairs of the Reichs Ministry of War, and by my order, the
chief of the supreme command of the Armed Forces exercises
the authority formerly belonging to the Reichs Minister.”
(<span class='it'>1915-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Another change in the composition of the cabinet during the
years in question should be noted. The post of vice-chancellor
was never refilled after the departure of von Papen on 30 July
1934.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to the heads of departments mentioned above, the
ordinary cabinet also contained Reich Ministers without portfolio.
Among these were Frank, Seyss-Inquart, Schacht (after
he left the Economics Ministry), and von Neurath (after he
was replaced as Ministry of the Interior). Other positions also
formed an integral part of the cabinet. Those were the Deputy
of the Fuehrer, Hess, and later his successor, the Leader of the
Party Chancellery, Bormann; the Chief of Staff of the SA, Ernst
Roehm, for the seven months prior to his assassination; the
Chief of the Reich Chancellery, Lammers; and, as already mentioned,
the Chief of the OKW, Keitel. These men had either
the title or rank of Reich Minister.
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Cabinet also contained other functionaries, such as State
Ministers acting as Reich Ministers. Only two persons fell within
this category—the Chief of the Presidential Chancellery, Otto
Meissner, and the State Minister of the Protectorate of Bohemia
and Moravia, Karl Hermann Frank. In addition, as named in
the Indictment, the ordinary cabinet included “others entitled to
take part in Cabinet meetings”. Many governmental agencies
were created by the Nazis between the years 1933 and 1945, but
the peculiarity of these creations was that in most instances the
new officials were given the right to participate in cabinet meetings.
Among those entitled to take part in Cabinet meetings were
the Commanders in Chief of the Army and the Navy; the Reich
Forest Master; the Inspector General for Water and Power; the
Inspector General of German Roads; the Reich Labor Leader; the
Reich Youth Leader; the Chief of the Foreign Organization in
the Foreign Office; the Reichsfuehrer SS and Chief of the German
Police in the Reich Ministry of the Interior; the Prussian
Finance Minister; and the Cabinet Press Chief. These posts and
officials comprising the ordinary cabinet all appear on the chart
entitled “Organization of the Reich Government,” and authenticated
by Frick (<span class='it'>Chart Number 18</span>). The persons who held these
posts in the ordinary cabinet varied between the years 1933 to
1945. Their names are listed in the chart (<span class='it'>Chart Number 18</span>),
which discloses that 17 of these officials are defendants in these
proceedings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>The Secret Cabinet Council.</span> Proof that there was only an
artificial distinction between the ordinary cabinet, the Secret
Cabinet Council, and the Council of Ministers for the Defense of
the Reich, is shown by the unity of personnel among the three
subdivisions. Thus, on 4 February 1938, Hitler created the
Secret Cabinet Council (<span class='it'>2031-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“To advise me in conducting the foreign policy I am setting
up a secret cabinet council.</p>

<p>“As president of the secret cabinet council, I nominate:
Reichsminister Freiherr von Neurath</p>

<p>“As members of the secret cabinet council I nominate:
Reichsminister for Foreign Affairs, Joachim von Ribbentrop</p>

<p>Prussian Prime Minister, Reichsminister of the Air, Supreme
Commander of the Air Forces, General Field Marshall
Hermann Goering</p>

<p>The Fuehrer’s Deputy, Reichsminister Rudolf Hess
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span></p>

<p>Reichsminister for the Enlightenment of the people and
of Propaganda, Dr. Joseph Goebbels</p>

<p>Reichsminister and Chief of the Reichs Chancellery Dr.
Hans-Heinrich Lammers</p>

<p>The Supreme Commander of the Army, General Walther
von Brauchitsch</p>

<p>The Supreme Commander of the Navy, Grand Admiral
Dr. (honorary) Erich Raeder</p>

<p>The Chief of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces
Lt. Gen. Wilhelm Keitel.” (<span class='it'>2031-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>It will be noted that every member of this group was either a
Reichsminister or, as, in the case of the Army, Navy, and OKW
heads, had the rank and authority of a Reich Minister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>The Council of Ministers for the Defense of the Reich.</span> On
30 August 1939 Hitler established the Council of Ministers for the
Defense of the Reich (better known as the Ministerial Council).
This was the so-called war cabinet. The decree establishing this
Council provided (<span class='it'>2018-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;'>“Article I</p>

<p>“(1) A Ministerial Council for Reich Defense shall be established
as a standing committee out of the Reich Defense
Council.</p>

<p>“(2) The standing members of the Ministerial Council for
Reich Defense shall include: General Field Marshall Goering
as chairman; Fuehrer’s Deputy [Hess]; Commissioner General
(or Plenipotentiary) for Reich Administration [Frick];
Commissioner General (or Plenipotentiary) for Economy
[Funk]; Reich Minister and Chief of the Reich Chancellery
[Dr. Lammers]; Chief of the High Command for the Armed
Forces [Keitel].</p>

<p>“(3) The chairman may draw on other members of the Reich
Defense Council including further personalities for advice.”
(<span class='it'>2018-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Again, all members of this group were also members of the
ordinary Cabinet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Reich Defense Council, for secret war planning, was created
by the Cabinet on 4 April 1933 (cf. the unpublished Reich
Defense Law of 21 May 1935 (<span class='it'>2261-PS</span>)). The membership of
that Council when first created is shown by the minutes of the
second session of the working committee of the delegates for
Reich Defense, dated 22 May 1933 and signed by Keitel (<span class='it'>EC-177</span>):

<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>
if necessary. Further personalities can be called as the case
demands.” (<span class='it'>2194-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On that date all the members also belonged to the ordinary
cabinet, for by that time the supreme commanders of the Army
and Navy had been given ministerial rank and authorized to participate
in cabinet meetings (<span class='it'>2098-PS</span>). It is also worth noting
that two members of the Reich Defense Council also appear in the
Ministerial Council under the same title—The Plenipotentiary for
Administration, and the Plenipotentiary for Economy. The former
post was held by Frick, while the latter was first held by
Schacht and then by Funk. These facts are verified by Frick on
the Nazi governmental organization chart (<span class='it'>Chart Number 18</span>).
Many other ministries were subordinated to these two posts for
war-planning aims and purposes. These two officials, together
with the Chief of the OKW, formed a powerful triumvirate known
as the “Three-Man College” (Frick, Funk, and Keitel) which figured
prominently in war plans and preparations.</p>

<h3>B. <span class='it'>Functions of the Reichsregierung.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>The utilization of the ordinary cabinet as a manpower reservoir
for other governmental agencies, the chronological development
of the offshoots of the ordinary cabinet, and the cohesion between
all of these groups, is apparent from the Nazi governmental organization
chart (<span class='it'>Chart Number 18</span>). The chart shows the following
offshoots of the ordinary cabinet: 1933, the Reich Defense
Council; 1935, the Three-Man College; 1936, the Delegate for the
Four Year Plan; 1938, the Secret Cabinet Council; 1939, The
Ministerial Defense Council; and 1944, the Delegate for Total War
Effort (Goebbels). In every case these important Nazi agencies
were staffed with personnel taken from the ordinary cabinet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>The Ordinary Cabinet.</span> The unity, cohesion, and interrelationship
of the sub-divisions of the <span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span> was not the
result of a co-mixture of personnel alone. It was also realized by
the method in which it operated. The ordinary cabinet consulted
together both by meetings and through the so-called circulation
procedure. Under the latter procedure, which was chiefly used
when meetings were not held, drafts of laws prepared in individual
ministries were distributed to other cabinet members for approval
or disapproval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man primarily responsible for the circulation of drafts of
laws under this procedure was Dr. Lammers, the Leader and Chief
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>
of the Reich Chancellery. Lammers has described that procedure
in an affidavit (<span class='it'>2999-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * I was Leader of the Reich Chancellery (<span class='it'>Leiter
der Reichskanzlei</span>) from 30 January 1933 until the end of
the war. In this capacity I circulated drafts of proposed
laws and decrees submitted to me by the Minister who had
drafted the law or decree, to all members of the Reich
Cabinet. A period of time was allowed for objections, after
which the law considered as being accepted by the various
members of the Cabinet. This procedure continued throughout
the whole war. It was followed also in the Council of
Ministers for Defense of the Reich (<span class='it'>Ministerrat fuer die
Reichsverteidigung</span>).” (<span class='it'>2999-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A memorandum dated 9 August 1943, which bears the facsimile
signature of Frick and is addressed to the Reich Minister
and Chief of the Reich Chancellery, illustrates how the circulation
procedure worked (<span class='it'>1701-PS</span>). Attached to the memorandum
is a draft of the law in question and a carbon copy of a letter
dated 22 December 1943 from Rosenberg to the Reich Minister
of the Interior, containing his comments on the draft:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='hang'>“To the Reich Minister and Chief of the Reich Chancellery,
in <span class='it'>Berlin W8</span>.</p>

<p>“For the information of the other Reich ministers.</p>

<p>“Subj: Law on the treatment of enemies of the society.</p>

<p>“In addition to my letter of 19 March, 1942.</p>

<p>“<span class='it'>Enclosures: 55.—</span></p>

<p>“After the draft of the law on the treatment of enemies of
the society has been completely rewritten, I am sending the
enclosed new draft with the consent of the Reich Minister of
Justice, Dr. Thierack, and ask that the law be approved in a
circulatory manner. The necessary number of prints is
attached.” (<span class='it'>1701-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Council of Ministers for the Defense of the Reich.</span> The
same procedure was followed in the Council of Ministers when
that body was created. And the decrees of the Council of Ministers
were also circulated to the members of the ordinary Cabinet.
A memorandum found in the files of the Reich Chancellery and
addressed to the members of the Council of Ministers, dated 17
September 1939, and bearing the typed signature of Dr. Lammers,
Reich Minister and Chief of the Reich Chancellery, states
(<span class='it'>1141-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Matters submitted to the Council of Ministers for the Reich
Defense have heretofore been distributed only to the members
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>
of the Council. I have been requested by some of the
Reichsministers who are not permanent members of the Council
to inform them of the drafts of decrees which are being
submitted to the Council, so as to enable them to check these
drafts from the point of view of their respective offices. I
shall follow this request so that all the Reichsministers will
in future be informed of the drafts of decrees which are to
be acted upon by the Council for the Reich Defense. I
therefore request to add forty-five additional copies of the
drafts, as well as of the letters which usually contain the
arguments for the drafts, to the folders submitted to the
Council.” (<span class='it'>1141-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Von Stutterheim, who was an official of the Reich Chancellery,
comments on this procedure at page 34 of a pamphlet entitled
“<span class='it'>Die Reichskanzlei</span>”:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * It must be noted that the peculiarity in this
case is that the subjects dealt with by the Cabinet Council—(Council
of Ministers for the Defense of the Reich), are
distributed not merely among the members of the Cabinet
Council, but also among all the members of the Cabinet
(<span class='it'>Kabinett</span>) who are thereby given the opportunity of guarding
the interests of their spheres of office by adding their
appropriate standpoints in the Cabinet Council legislation,
even if they do not participate in making the decree.”
(<span class='it'>2231-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>For a time the Cabinet consulted together through actual
meetings. The Council of Ministers did likewise, but those members
of the Cabinet who were not already members of the Council
also attended the meetings of the Ministerial Council. And
where they did not attend in person, they were usually represented
by the state secretaries of their Ministries. The minutes
of six meetings of the Council of Ministers, on 1, 4, 8, and 19 September
1939, on 16 October 1939, and on 15 November 1939,
demonstrate this procedure. (<span class='it'>2852-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the meeting held on 1 September 1939, which was probably
the first meeting since the Council was created on 30 August
1939, the following were in attendance:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Present were the permanent members of the Council of
Ministers for the Reich Defense: The Chairman and Generalfield
Marshall, Goering; the Deputy of the Fuehrer, Hess
[a line appears through the name Hess]; the Plenipotentiary
for Reich Administration, Dr. Frick; the Plenipotentiary for
Economy, Funk; the Reich Minister and Chief of the Reich
Chancellery, Dr. Lammers; and the Chief of the High Command
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>
of the Armed Forces, Keitel, represented by Major
General Thomas.” (<span class='it'>2852-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>These were the regular members of the Council. Also present
was the Reich Minister for Food and Agriculture, Darré, and
seven State Secretaries: Koerner, Neumann, Stuckart, Posse,
Landfried, Backe, and Syrup (<span class='it'>2852-PS</span>). These State Secretaries
were from the several Ministries or other supreme Reich
authorities. Koerner was the Deputy of Goering in the Four-Year
Plan; Stuckart was in the Ministry of the Interior; Landfried
was in the Ministry of Economics; Syrup was in the Ministry
of Labor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The minutes dated 8 September 1939 (<span class='it'>2852-PS</span>) note that in
addition to all members of the Ministerial Council, the following
also were present:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Reich Minister for Food and Agriculture * * *
Darré; State Minister * * * Popitz;”</p>

</div>

<p>Then come the names of nine State Secretaries from the several
Ministries, and then:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“SS Gruppenfuehrer * * * Heydrich;”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The close integration of the Ministerial Council with the ordinary
Cabinet is seen by the following excerpt from the minutes
of the same date (8 September 1939):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Council of Ministers for the Reich Defense ratified the
decree for the change of the Labor Service Law which had
already been passed as law by the Reich Cabinet. (<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>,
Part I, page 1744.)”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The minutes of the meeting of 19 September 1939 (<span class='it'>2852-PS</span>)
show the following Reich Ministers to be present in addition to
four members of the Council:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Also: The Reich Minister for Finance, Count Schwerin von
Krosigk.</p>

<p>The Reich Minister for Food and Agriculture, Darré.</p>

<p>The Reich Minister for Enlightenment and Propaganda, Dr.
Goebbels.</p>

<p>State Minister * * * Dr. Popitz.” (<span class='it'>2852-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Then come the names of eight State Secretaries. Others present
included:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“SS Gruppenfuehrer * * * Heydrich; General of the
Police (<span class='it'>Ordnungpolizei</span>) Daluege.” (<span class='it'>2852-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>The minutes dated 15 November 1939 show the same co-mixture
of Ministers, State Secretaries, and similar functionaries. In
addition, the following were also present:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Reichsleiter, Dr. Ley; Reichsleiter, Bouhler; Reichsfuehrer
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>

Himmler; The Reich Labor Service Leader, Hierl * * *
Reich Commissioner for Price Control, Wagner * * *
as well as experts (<span class='it'>Sachbearbeiter</span>) of the German Labor
Front and the Reich Labor Service.” (<span class='it'>2852-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Some of the decrees passed and matters discussed at these meetings
of the Ministerial Council are significant. At the first meeting
of 1 September 1939 14 decrees were ratified by the Council.
Decree No. 6 concerned</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * the organization of the administration and about
the German safety police in the Protectorate of Bohemia and
Moravia. (<span class='it'>RGBl</span>, I, page 1681).” (<span class='it'>2852-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>At the meeting of the Council on 19 September 1939 the following
occurred;</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Chairman of the Council, Generalfieldmarshall Goering,
made comments regarding the structure of civil administration
in the occupied Polish territory. He expressed his intentions
regarding the economic evacuation measures in this
territory. Then the questions of decreasing wages and the
questions of working hours and the support of members of
families of inducted workers were discussed.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The Chairman directed that all members of the Council regularly
receive the situation reports of the Reichsfuehrer SS.
Then the question of the population of the future Polish Protectorate
was discussed and the placement of Jews living in
Germany.” (<span class='it'>2852-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Finally, at the meeting of 15 November 1939 the discussion concerned,
among other things, the “treatment of Polish Prisoners
of War”. (<span class='it'>2852-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The minutes of these meetings (<span class='it'>2852-PS</span>) not only establish the
close working union between agencies of the state and the
party, especially the SS, but also tends to establish that the
<span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span> was responsible for the policies adopted and put
into effect by the government.</p>

<h3>C. <span class='it'>Powers of The Reichsregierung.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>But mere working alliances would be meaningless unless there
was power. And the <span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span> had power. Short of Hitler
himself, it had practically all the power a government can exercise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>The Ordinary Cabinet.</span> The Nazi conspirators secured the
passage by the Reichstag of the “Law for the Protection of the
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>
People and the Reich,” of 24 March 1933 (<span class='it'>2001-PS</span>), which
vested the Cabinet with legislative powers even to the extent of
deviating from previously existing constitutional law. These
powers were retained even after the members of the cabinet were
changed, and the several states, provinces, and municipalities,
which had formerly exercised semi-autonomous powers, were
transformed into mere administrative organs of the central government.
The ordinary cabinet emerged all-powerful from this
rapid succession of events. Frick waxed eloquent upon that
achievement in an article which he wrote for the 1935 National
Socialist Year Book:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The relationship between the Reich and the States has been
put on an entirely new basis, never known in the history of
the German people. It gives to the Reich cabinet (<span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span>)
unlimited power. It even makes it its duty, to
build a completely unified leadership and administration of
the Reich. From now on, there is only one national authority:
The one of the Reich! Thus, the German Reich has become
a unified state, and the entire administration in the
states is only carried out by order or in the name of the
Reich. The state borders are now only administration, technical
are boundaries but no longer boundaries of sovereignty!
In calm determination, the Reich Cabinet (<span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span>)
realizes step by step, supported by the confidence of the entire
German people, the great longing of the Nation. The
creation of the national socialist German, unified state.”
(<span class='it'>2380-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The heightened legislative power of the Cabinet is also emphasized
in an article written by Dr. Franz Medicus, an official in
the Reich Ministry of the Interior, and published in 1939 in Volume
4 of “<span class='it'>Das Dritte Reich in Aufbau</span>”:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * Worked out by the Reich Minister of the Interior,
the ‘Law for Alleviation of the Distress of People and Reich’,
in short called ‘Enabling Law’, was issued on 24 March 1933,
broke with the liberal principle of ‘division of power’ by
transferring the legislature from the Reichstag to the Reich
Cabinet, so that legislation by <span class='it'>personally responsible persons</span>
took the place of ‘anonymous’ legislation.” (<span class='it'>2849-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>When the Ministerial Council was formed in 1939, it too was
given legislative powers (cf. Article II of the decree of 30 August
1939 (<span class='it'>2018-PS</span>)). The ordinary cabinet also continued to legislate
throughout the war. Because of the fusion of personnel between
the Ministerial Council and the ordinary cabinet, questions
were bound to arise as to what forum should lend its name to a
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>
particular law. Dr. Lammers, Chief of the Reich Chancellery and
a member of both agencies, wrote a letter on 14 June 1942 to the
Plenipotentiary for Reich Administration about these questions
(<span class='it'>352-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“To the Plenipotentiary for the Reich Administration (<span class='it'>Generalbevollmaechtigter
die Reich Verwaltung</span>)</p>

<p>“Subject: The Jurisdiction of the Council of Ministers for
the Defense of the Reich (<span class='it'>Ministerat fuer die Reichsverteidigung</span>)</p>

<p>“Your letter of 3 June 1942, No. 493/42/2882.—Recently
the Fuehrer announced in accord with the opinions of the
Reich Marshal of the Greater German Reich as shown in my
letter of 20 Feb. 1940-RK. 624-B—that he believes it practical
to reserve certain legislative missions for the Reich
Cabinet. With this he has not limited the competency of the
Council of Ministers for the defense of the Reich but given
a directive as to how legislation should be handled under the
point of view of practicability. I have no doubt that the
Fuehrer, as well as the Reich Marshal, have not changed
their point of view, in particular, regarding the fact, that
at the present there should be only legislation important in
the cause of war, and that they will stress the fact that the
Fuehrer himself and the Reich Cabinet should not be eliminated
from the powers of legislation. It will have to be
tested from time to time what measures will be reserved for
the Reich Cabinet. My letter of 20 February 1940, and the
opinions of the Fuehrer therein expressed may serve as a
directive even if the limitations indicated by me are no longer
applicable in their full meaning. I would therefore suggest
not basing the discussions with the Reich Minister of Finance
on the question of competency of the Reich Cabinet or the
Council of Ministers for the Defence of the Reich, but on
the question of whether it would be practical to achieve
settlement through either Reich law or a Decree from the
Council of Ministers for the defense of the Reich in the
sense of the opinions voiced by the Fuehrer.</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>(signed)&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Lammers” (<span class='it'>352-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Other officials possessed legislative powers. Hitler was of
course one. Goering, as Deputy of the Four Year Plan, could and
did issue decrees with the effect of law. The Cabinet delegated
power to issue laws deviating from existing law to the Plenipotentiaries
of Economy and Administration and the Chief of the
OKW, the so-called Three-Man College. This was done in the
Secret Defense Law of 1938 (<span class='it'>2194-PS</span>). These three officials—Frick,
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>
Funk, and Keitel—however, were also members of the
Council of Ministers and of the ordinary cabinet as well. It can
therefore be said, in the language of the Indictment, that the
<span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span> “possessed * * * legislative * * * powers
of a very high order in the system of the German government.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The executive and administrative powers of the Reich were
concentrated in the central government primarily as the result
of two basic Nazi laws that reduced the separate states (called
<span class='it'>Laender</span>) to mere geographical divisions. One was the law of
30 January 1934, known as the Law for the Reconstruction of
the Reich (<span class='it'>2006-PS</span>). By that law the States were deprived of
their independent status as States, their legislative assemblies
were abolished, and their sovereign powers were transferred to
the Reich. The other was the Reich Governor’s Law, enacted by
the Cabinet on 30 January 1935 (<span class='it'>2008-PS</span>), which made all Reich
Governors (<span class='it'>Statthalters</span>) permanent delegates of and subject to
the order of the cabinet and, more especially, of the Reich Minister
of the Interior. As a result, the ordinary cabinet was possessed
of wide powers, which are set forth in “Administration
Law,” periodical published in 1944 which was edited by Dr. Wilhelm
Stuckart, State Secretary in the Reich Ministry of the Interior,
and Dr. Harry V. Rosen-v. Hoewel, an <span class='it'>Oberregierungsrat</span>
in the Reich Ministry of the Interior (<span class='it'>2959-PS</span>). The description
of the powers and functions of all the ministries of the ordinary
cabinet illustrates the extent of control vested in the <span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

It is primarily his duty to coordinate the measures for

<h3>D. <span class='it'>Acts and Decrees of the Reichsregierung.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Under the Nazi regime the <span class='it'>Reichsregierung</span> became the instrument
of the Nazi party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Execution of the Nazi Party Program.</span> In the original
Cabinet of 30 January 1933 only three cabinet members were
members of the Party—Goering, Frick, and Hitler. As new
Ministries were added to the Cabinet, prominent Nazis were
placed at their head. On 30 January, 1937, Hitler accepted into
the Party those Cabinet members who were not already members.
This action is reported in the <span class='it'>Voelkischer Beobachter</span>, South German
Edition, of 1 February 1937 (<span class='it'>2964-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“In view of the anticipated lifting of the ban for party membership,
the Fuehrer, as the first step in this regard, personally
carried out the enlistment into the party of the
<span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>
members of the Cabinet, who so far had not belonged to it
and he handed them simultaneously the Gold Party Badge,
the supreme badge of honor of the party. In addition, the
Fuehrer awarded the Gold Party Badge to Generaloberst
Freiherr von Fritsch; Generaladmiral Dr. H. C. Raeder; the
Prussian Minister of Finance, Professor Popitz; and the
Secretary of State and Chief of the Presidential Chancellery,
Dr. Meissner.</p>

<p>“The Fuehrer also honored with the gold party badge the
party members State Secretary Dr. Lammers, State Secretary
Funk, State Secretary Koerner and State Secretary
General of the Airforce Milch.” (<span class='it'>2964-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It was possible to refuse the party membership thus conferred.
Only one man, von Eltz-Ruebenach, who was the Minister of Post
and Minister of Transport at the time, did this. His letter from
von Eltz-Ruebenach to Hitler, dated 30 January 1937, reads as
follows (<span class='it'>1534-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“My Fuehrer:</p>

<p>“I thank you for the confidence you have placed in me during
the four years of your leadership and for the honor you
do me in offering to admit me to the party. My conscience
forbids me however to accept this offer. I believe in the
principles of positive Christianity and must remain faithful
to my Lord and to myself. Party membership however would
mean that I should have to face without contradiction the
steadily aggravating attacks by party offices on the Christian
confessions and those who want to remain faithful to
their religious convictions.</p>

<p>“This decision has been infinitely difficult for me. For never
in my life have I performed my duty with greater joy and
satisfaction than under your wise state leadership.</p>

<p>“I ask to be permitted to resign.</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;'>“With German Greetings:</p>
<p class='line0' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;'>Yours very obediently,</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>But the Nazis did not wait until all members of the cabinet
were party members. Shortly after they came to power, they
quickly assured themselves of active participation in the work of
the Cabinet. On 1 December 1933, the Cabinet passed a law securing
the unity of party and state (<span class='it'>1395-PS</span>). In Article 2 of
that law the Deputy of the Fuehrer, Hess, and the Chief of Staff
of the SA, Roehm, were made members of the Cabinet (<span class='it'>1395-PS</span>).
Lest mere membership in the Cabinet would not be effective, Hitler
endowed his deputy with greater powers of participation. An
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>
unpublished decree signed by Hitler, dated 27 July 1934, and addressed
to the Reich Ministers, provides (<span class='it'>D-138</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I decree that the Deputy of the Fuehrer, Reich Minister
Hess, will have the capacity of a participating Reich Minister
in connection with the preparation of drafts for laws in all
Reich Administrative spheres. All legislative work is to be
sent to him when it is received by the other Reich Minister
concerned. This also applies in cases where no one else
participates except the Reich Minister making the draft.
Reich Minister Hess will be given the opportunity to comment
on drafts suggested by experts.</p>

<p>“This order will apply in the same sense to legislative
ordinances. The Deputy of the Fuehrer in his capacity of
Reich Minister can send as representative an expert on his
staff. These experts are entitled to make statements to
the Reich Ministers on his behalf.</p>

</div>

<p>Hess himself made pertinent comment on his right of participation
on behalf of the party, in a letter dated 9 October 1934,
on the stationery of the NSDAP, addressed to the Reich Minister
for Enlightenment of the People and Propaganda (<span class='it'>D-139</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“By a decree of the Fuehrer dated 27 July 1934, I have been
granted the right to participate in the legislation of the Reich
as regards both formal laws and legal ordinances. This right
must not be rendered illusory by the fact that I am sent the
drafts of laws and decrees so late and am then given a limited
time, so that it becomes impossible for me to deal with the
material concerned during the given time. I must point out
that my participation means the taking into account of the
opinion of the NSDAP as such, and that in the case of the
majority of drafts of laws and decrees, consult with the appropriate
departments of the Party before making my comment.
Only by proceeding in this manner can I do justice
to the wish of the Fuehrer as expressed in the decree of the
Fuehrer of 27 July 1934.</p>

<p>“I must therefore ask the Reich Ministers to arrange that
drafts of laws and decrees reach me in sufficient time. Failing
this, I would be obliged in future to refuse my agreement
to such drafts from the beginning and without giving the
matter detailed attention, in all cases where I am not given a
sufficiently long period for dealing with them.</p>

Such personal unions exist in the cases of Food Minister

Police and the Reich Labor Leader, the Chief of the Organization
in foreign countries, and the Reich Youth Fuehrer.
Furthermore, the majority of the Reich Ministries is occupied
by leading old party members. Finally, all Reich Ministers

the Nazi Party program of 25 points (<span class='it'>1708-PS</span>) was more than a

<p class='pindent'>Point 1 of this program declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“We demand the inclusion of all Germans in a greater Germany

<p class='noindent'>In implication of this demand the Nazi Cabinet enacted, among
others, the following laws: the law of 3 February 1938 concerning
the obligation of German citizens in foreign countries to register
(1938 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I, page 113); the law of 13
March 1938 for the reunion of Austria with Germany (1938

<p class='noindent'>“We demand * * * the cancellation of the treaties of
Versailles and St. Germain.” (<span class='it'>1708-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='noindent'>The following acts of the Cabinet supported this part of the program:
The proclamation of 14 October 1933 to the German people
concerning Germany’s withdrawal from the League of Nations
and the Disarmament Conference (1933 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part
I, page 730); the proclamation and law of 16 March 1935, for the
establishment of the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> and compulsory military service
(1935 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I, pages 369, 375) (<span class='it'>1654-PS</span>); and
the defense law of 21 May 1935 implementing the last-named law
(1935 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I, page 609).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Point 4 of the Party platform read as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Only those who are members of the ‘Volk’ can be citizens.
Only those who are of German blood, without regard to religion,
can be members of the ‘Volk’. No Jew, therefore, can
be a member of the ‘Volk’.” (<span class='it'>1708-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='noindent'>Among the cabinet laws which implemented this point were these:
the law of 14 July 1933 for the recall of naturalization and the
deprivation of citizenship (1933 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I, page
480); the law of 7 April 1933 permitting persons of non-Aryan

1933 restricting the number of non-Aryans in schools and higher
institutions (1933 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I, page 225) (<span class='it'>2022-PS</span>);
the law of 29 September 1933 excluding persons of Jewish
blood from the peasantry (1933 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I, page

on the legal status of Jewish religious communities (1938 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>,
Part I, page 338); and the law of 6 July 1938 prohibiting
Jews from participating in six different types of business

<p class='pindent'>Even the anti-Jewish Nurnberg laws of 15 September 1935,
although technically passed by the Reichstag, were nevertheless
worked out by the Ministry of the Interior. Dr. Franz A.
Medicus, who served as <span class='it'>Ministerialdirigent</span> in the Ministry of
the Interior, made this statement in a book published in 1940
(<span class='it'>2960-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * The work of the Reich Ministry of Interior forms
the basis for the three Nurnberg Laws passed by a resolution
of the Reichstag on the occasion of the Reich party
meeting of Freedom.</p>

<p>“The ‘Reich Citizenship Law’ as well as the ‘Law for the
protection of German blood and German honor’ (Blood Protection
Law) opened extensive tasks for the Ministry of
Interior not only in the field of administration. The same
applies to the ‘Reich Flag Law’ that gives the foundation
for the complete re-organization of the use of the flag

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) <span class='it'>Decrees of The Council of Ministers.</span> Decrees of the
Council of Ministers similarly supplied the “legal” basis for
other criminal actions of the Nazi conspirators. Among these
laws are the following: Decree of 5 August 1940 imposing
a discriminatory tax on Polish workers in Germany (1940
<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I, page 1077); Decree of 4 December
1941 regarding penal measures against Jews and Poles in the
occupied Eastern Territories (1941 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, Part I,
page 759) (<span class='it'>2746-PS</span>); and Decree of 30 June 1942 concerning
<span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>
the employment of Eastern Workers (1942 <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>,
Part I, page 419). (<span class='it'>2039-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost immediately upon Hitler’s coming to power, the Cabinet
participated in the Nazi conspiracy to wage aggressive war.
This fact appears clearly from the minutes of the second session
of the working committee of the Delegates for Reich Defense,
dated 22 May 1933 and signed by Keitel (<span class='it'>EC-177</span>); from a letter
dated 24 June 1935 and signed by von Blomberg, the Reichs
Minister of War, which transmits a copy of the secret, unpublished
Reich Defense Law of 21 May 1935 and also a copy of the
decision of the Reich Cabinet of 21 May 1935 in the Council for
the Defense of the Reich (<span class='it'>2261-PS</span>); and from a letter dated 5
September 1939 transmitting a copy of the secret, unpublished
Reich Defense Law of 4 September 1938 (a note dated 4 September
1938 attached to this law states that the Reich Defense law of
21 May 1935 and the decisions of the Cabinet previously mentioned
are repeated) (<span class='it'>2194-PS</span>). These three documents, important
in the conspiracy to wage aggressive war emphasize the
participation of the Reich Cabinet and Reich Ministers, through
legislative enactments, in the conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Reich Defense Council was a creation of the Cabinet. On
4 April 1933 the Cabinet decided to form that agency (<span class='it'>2261-PS</span>).
The circumstances of its creation were discussed at the meeting
of 22 May 1933 (<span class='it'>EC-177</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“<span class='it'>Thoughts about a Reich Defense Council</span></p>

<p>“All great European powers which are at freedom to arm,
have a RVR. One does not have to refer to history to prove
the necessity of this institution. The war has shown conclusively
that the cooperation with the various ministries
has not been close enough. The consequences did not fail to
materialize. The soldier is not in a position to have a say in
all matters. The disadvantages of the past system were
caused by parallel efforts of the various ministries in matters
of the Reich defense. To avoid these mistakes a <span class='it'>central
agency</span> has been created which occupies itself already in
peacetime in the widest sense with the problems of Reich
Defense. This working staff will continue its existence in
time of war.</p>

<p>“In accordance with the cabinet decision of the 4 April 1933
the Reich Defense Council, which until now had been prepared
for war emergency, will go into immediate action.</p>

<p>“In time of peace its task will be to decide about all measures
for the preparation of the defense of the Reich, while surveying
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>
and utilizing all powers and means of the nation.”
(<span class='it'>EC-177</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The composition of the Reich Defense Council is thereupon set
out. Hitler was President; the Minister of Defense was his
deputy; and he, plus six more ministers (there were only ten at
that time) and the Chiefs of the Army and Navy Command Staffs
were permanent members. The remaining ministers, as well as
“leading industrialists”, were subject to call. Of the defendants
who were then members of the Council, there was von Neurath
as Foreign Affairs Minister; Frick as Interior Minister, Goering
as Air Minister; and Raeder as Chief of the Navy Command
Staff. (<span class='it'>EC-177</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The presence of Cabinet ministers was indispensable. The
cabinet by that time could legislate for the Reich. It had a
definite role to play in this planning, as Keitel pointed out
(<span class='it'>EC-177</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>Col. Keitel</span>:—Points out once more the urgency of the tasks,
since it had been possible to do only very little in this connection
during the last years. He asks the delegates to consider
the Reich Defense at all times and represent it accordingly
at the drafting of new laws. Experiences of the wars
are available and are at the disposal of the various ministries;
(e.g. Reich Archives, Memorandum of an administrative
official about gasoline supply). All these sources must
be taken advantage of for the future. The task of the full
time delegates is also to bring about a close cooperation of
the ministries with each other.” (<span class='it'>EC-177</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Each separate ministry, moreover, was scheduled for a definite
task.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * In the work plans the questions and ideas are laid
down, which have come up in the <span class='it'>Reichswehr</span> Ministry and
must be considered in case of mobilization. Up to the present
time the support on the part of other Ministries was frequently
based only on personal helpfulness since any authority
from above was lacking. The following work plans
are finished.</p>

<p class='hang'>“<span class='it'>a.</span> Work Plan for the Reich Ministry of Economics.<br/>
Work Plan for the Reich Ministry of Food and Agriculture.<br/>
Work Plan for the Reich Ministry of Labor.</p>

<p>“These three are composed in one work plan for the preparation
of a war economy.</p>

<p class='hang'>“<span class='it'>b.</span> Work Plan for the Reich Postal Ministry.
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span></p>

<p class='hang'>“<span class='it'>c.</span> Work Plan for the Reich Traffic Ministry.</p>

<p>“Request the plans to be worked through carefully by the
competent Ministries. The plans will be discussed beginning
of June, when proposals for improvements may be made.
The other Ministries which have no work plans yet will receive
them later on. The Office of Air Raid Protection will
work out a work plan in conjunction with the Reich Commissariat
for Aviation.” (<span class='it'>EC-177</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>The secrecy of all undertakings was stressed:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;'>“<span class='it'>Security and Secrecy.</span>”</p>

<p>“Question has been brought up by the Reich Ministries.</p>

<p>“The secrecy of all Reich Defense work has to be maintained
very carefully. Communications with the outside by <span class='it'>messenger
service</span> only, has been settled already with the Post
Office, Finance Ministry, Prussian Ministry of the Interior
and the Reichswehr Ministry. <span class='it'>Main Principle of security</span>:
No document must be lost since, otherwise, the enemy propaganda
would make use of it. Matters communicated orally
cannot be proven; they can be denied by us in Geneva. Therefore,
the <span class='it'>Reichswehr</span> Ministry has worked out security directives
for the Reich Ministries and the Prussian Ministry of
the Interior.” (<span class='it'>EC-177</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As time went on and greater concentration of power was
needed, the Cabinet made changes and additions to this secret
war planning body. Article 6 of the Secret Defense Law of 1935
(<span class='it'>2261-PS</span>) provided:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“(1) The Fuehrer and Reichschancellor will appoint a
plenipotentiary-general for war economy to direct the entire
war economy.</p>

<p>“(2) It is the task of the plenipotentiary-general for war
economy to put all economic forces in the service of carrying
on the war and to secure the life of the German people
economically.</p>

<p>“(3) Subordinate to him are:</p>

<div class='lgl' style=''> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>The Reichsminister for Economy.</p>
<p class='line0'>The Reichsminister for Food and Agriculture.</p>
<p class='line0'>The Reichs Labor Minister.</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p>The Reichs Forest Master, and all Reichs’ agencies immediately
subordinate to the Fuehrer and Reichschancellor.
Furthermore the financing of the war effort (in the province
of the Reichs Finance Ministry and of the Reichsbank) will
be carried on under his responsibility.</p>

<p>“(4) The Plenipotentiary-General for War Economy is authorized,
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>
within his realm of responsibility to issue legal
regulations, which may deviate from the existing laws.”
(<span class='it'>2261-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht was named as Plenipotentiary for War Economy. It
will be noted that the Reich Ministers for Food and Agriculture
and for Labor, and the Reichs Forest Master (who by this time
had Cabinet rank) had not been included in the original membership
of the Reichs Defense Council. Darré was Minister for Food
and Agriculture, Seldte for Labor, and Goering was Reich Forest
Master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the same day the Law was passed, the Cabinet made these
decisions covering the newly-created Plenipotentiary-General for
War Economy (<span class='it'>EC-177</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“1. The Plenipotentiary-General for War Economy appointed
by the Fuehrer and Reichschancellor will begin his work
already in peacetime * * *.</p>

<p>“2. The Reichsminister of War and the Plenipotentiary for
War Economy will effect the preparations for mobilization
in closest cooperation on both sides.</p>

<p>“3. The Plenipotentiary-General for War Economy will be a
permanent member of the Reich Defense Council (<span class='it'>Reichsverteidigungsrat</span>).
Within the working committee he represents
through his leadership staff the interests of war economy.”
(<span class='it'>EC-177</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The complete reorganization of this Reich Defense Council
took place in 1938, under the Secret Defense Law of 4th September
of that year. By that time, there had been a reorganization
of the Armed Forces: the chief of the OKW had been created and
the War Ministry had been abolished (<span class='it'>2194-PS</span>). The Reich Defense
Council in 1938 was composed of Goering, as permanent
deputy and Minister of Air and Supreme Commander of the Air
Force; Raeder as Supreme Commander of the Navy; Hess as
Deputy of the Fuehrer; von Neurath as President of the Secret
Cabinet Council; Frick as Plenipotentiary for the Reich Administration;
Keitel as Chief of the OKW; Funk as Plenipotentiary
for Economics; Ribbentrop as Minister of Foreign Affairs;
Schacht as President of the Reichsbank directorate (<span class='it'>2261-PS</span>).
An important part of the Reich Defense Council was the Working
Committee. The minutes of the twelfth meeting of the Reich
Defense Working Committee, on 14 May 1936, read (<span class='it'>EC-407</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“1. <span class='it'>The National Minister of War and Supreme Commander
of the Armed Forces</span>, General Field Marshal von Blomberg,
opened the 12th meeting of the Reichs Defense Committee
<span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span>
by expressing thanks for the work accomplished and pointing
out in principle the necessity of a preparation for a total
mobilization with emphasis on the most important measures
to be taken at this time. (Among others; mobilization
schedule, legal basis, preparations in the demilitarized zone.)
He further indicates the assignment of the national resources
(<span class='it'>Reichsressort</span>) to finance its measures for preparation
of the Reichs defense out of its budget.</p>

<p>“2. The <span class='it'>chairman</span> of the <span class='it'>Reichs Defense</span> Committee,
Lieutenant General Keitel, states:</p>

<p>“In today’s and future meetings of the Reichs Defense Committee
a cross section of the general situation concerning all
matters of the national defense is presented. The picture of
the situation does not appear in the reports of the meetings.</p>

<p>“The open discussion of State secrets before our large committee
gives the special obligation to the chairman of the
Reichs Defense Committee of pointing out its <span class='it'>secrecy</span>.</p>

<p>“Today’s sessions takes place under the auspices of the
restoration of the State authority in the demilitarized zone.</p>

<p>“The difficulties of the economic situation, which are presented
today, must be mastered.” (<span class='it'>EC-407</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>This Working Committee was still functioning in 1939. The
Mobilization Book for Civil Administration of 1939 states, in part
(<span class='it'>1639-A-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>“D.</span><p class='listPara'><span class='it'>Terms for Mobilization Preparations by the Civil Administration.</span></p>

Chief of the Reich Defense Committee (Department of
State Defense in the Armed Forces High Command).”
(<span class='it'>1639-A-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The composition of the Working Committee was redefined by
the Secret Law of 1938 as follows (<span class='it'>2194-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“<span class='it'>The Reich Defense Committee</span> [<span class='it'>Reichsverteidigungsausschuss</span>]
(RVA):</p>

<p>“(1) The Reich Defense Committee is the working Committee
of the RVR. It prepares the decisions of the RVR, sees to
their execution, and secures collaboration between armed
forces, chief Reich offices, and party.</p>

<p>“(2) Presiding is the chief of the OKW. He regulates the
activity of the committee and gives the directions to the GBV
and GBW and to the Reich ministries not subordinated to
them and to the chief Reich offices according to the decisions
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>
of the RVR, which directions are necessary for securing their
uniform execution.</p>

<p>“(3) The RVA is composed of the OKW, deputy of the commissioner
for the four year plan, the leader staffs of the GBV
and GBW, and the Reich Defense officials.</p>

<p>“(4) Chief office officials for the Reich defense (<span class='it'>RV-Referenten</span>)
and their deputies are commissioned by the deputy of
the leader, by the Reich Chancellery, by each Reich Ministry,
by the Reich Leader of the SS and chief of the German police,
by the Reich work leaders, by the Reich Forest Master, by
the Chief Inspector for the German Road Net, by the Reich
Office for Regional Order, by the Reichsbank directorate, and
in the Prussian state ministry. RV-Referent and his deputy
are immediately subordinate to the minister or the state secretary,
and to the chief of the Reich office, resp.” (<span class='it'>2194-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The GBV and the GBW mentioned in the portion quoted above
are, respectively, the Plenipotentiaries for Administration and
for Economy. Under them were grouped other ministries, some
of which were already permanent members of the Council. By
paragraph 3 of the Secret Law the following were made subordinate
to the Plenipotentiary for Administration: the Ministers
of the Interior, Justice, Science and Education, Churches; the
Reich Authority for Spatial Planning; and, for limited purposes,
the Minister of Finance. Subordinate to and under the direction
of the Plenipotentiary for Economy (a position formerly held by
Schacht under the title “War Economy” and later held by Funk)
were the ministers of Economics, Food, Agriculture, Labor, and
for limited purposes, the Reich Finance Ministry and the Reichsbank;
the Reich Forest Master; and the Commissioner for Price
Control from the 4-Year Plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paragraph 5 of the law (<span class='it'>2194-PS</span>) shows that subordinated to
the Chief of the OKW were the Reich Postal Minister, the Reich
Transportation Minister, and the General Inspector for German
Highways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This concentration of power by the Cabinet was for one purpose
only: to plan secretly with the strongest means at hand for
the waging of aggressive war. Further evidence of this objective
is contained in an affidavit by Frick covering the place, activities,
and scope of the Reich Defense Council, including the Three-Man
College (<span class='it'>2986-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I, Wilhelm Frick, being first duly sworn, depose and say:</p>

<p>“I was Plenipotentiary for Reich Administration (<span class='it'>Generalbevollmaechtigter
fuer die Reichsverwaltung</span>) from the time
when this office was created, until 20 August 1943. Heinrich
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>
Himmler was my deputy in this capacity. Before the
outbreak of the war my task as Plenipotentiary for Reich
Administration was the preparation of organization in the
event of war, such as, for instance, the appointment of liaison
men in the different ministries who would keep in touch
with me. As Plenipotentiary for Reich Administration, I,
together with the Plenipotentiary for Economy and OKW
formed what was called a ‘3-Man College’ (<span class='it'>Dreierkollegium</span>).
We also were members of the Reich defense Council
(<span class='it'>Reichsverteidigungsrat</span>), which was supposed to plan preparations
and decrees in case of war which later on were
published by the Ministerial Council for the Defense of the
Reich. Since, as soon as the war started, everything had
to be done speedily and there would have been no time for
planning, such measures and decrees were prepared in advance
in case of war. All one then still had to do was to
pull out of the drawer the war orders that had been prepared.
Later on, after the outbreak of the war, these decrees
were enacted by the Ministerial Council for the defense
of the Reich.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg133a'>4. THE STURMABTEILUNG (SA)</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Sturmabteilung</span>, or SA, is the organization which the
world remembers as the “Brown Shirts” or Storm Troops—the
gangsters of the early days of Nazi terrorism. Since it was
the first of the organizations created by the Nazis as instruments
<span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>
to effectuate their illegal objectives, the SA occupied a
place of peculiar importance in the scheme of the conspirators.
Unlike some of the other organizations, the functions of the SA
were not fixed or static. The SA was an agency adapted to
many designs and purposes, and its role in the conspiracy
changed from time to time various phases toward the final objective—abrogation
of the Versailles Treaty and acquisition of
the territory of other peoples and nations. If the conspiracy
is likened to a pattern, with its various parts fitting together
like the pieces of a jig-saw puzzle, the piece representing the
SA would be found to constitute the essential link in the pattern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The SA participated in the conspiracy as a distinct and separate
unit, having a legal character of its own. An ordinance
passed in March, 1935, provided that the SA and certain other
agencies were thereafter to be considered “components” of the
Nazi Party (<span class='it'>1725-PS</span>). This ordinance further provided, in Article
5, that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * The affiliated organizations can possess their own
legal character.” (<span class='it'>1725-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Similarly, the 1943 Organization Book of the Nazi Party which
characterizes the SA as an “entity,” declares:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Fuehrer prescribes the law of conduct; he commands
its use. The Chief of Staff represents the SA as a complete
entity on the mandate of the Fuehrer.” (<span class='it'>3220-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>While the SA was composed of many individual members, they
acted as a unit. They were closely bound together by many common
factors, including uniform membership standards and disciplinary
regulations; a common and distinctive uniform; common
aims and objectives; common activities, duties, and responsibilities;
and a fanatical adherence to the ideologies conceived by
the Nazis. Although membership in the SA was voluntary, the SA
man was expected to withdraw if</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“he can no longer agree with SA views or if he is not in a
position to fulfill completely the duties imposed upon him as
a member of the SA.” (<span class='it'>2354-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The SA man was well schooled in the philosophies and activities
which he was required to adopt in his daily life. Uniformity of
action and thought in such matters was in part obtained by the
publication and distribution of a weekly periodical entitled “<span class='it'>Der
SA-Mann</span>.” This publication was principally devoted to fostering
various aspects of Nazi ideology. In addition, “<span class='it'>Der SA-Mann</span>”
reported upon the activities of the SA and its constituent groups.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The SA developed from scattered bands of street ruffians into
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>
a cohesive unit organized on a military basis, with military training
and military functions, and with an aggressive spirit and
philosophy. The organization extended throughout the entire
Reich and was organized vertically into local subdivisions. Horizontally,
there were special units including military, cavalry, communications,
engineer, and medical units. These various groups
and branches were coordinated by the SA Headquarters and
operational offices, located in Munich.</p>

<h3>A. <span class='it'>The Relationship Between The SA and The Nazi Party.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>The affiliation between the SA and the Nazi leaders was closely
maintained, for the purpose of enabling the conspirators to employ
the SA for any activity necessary in effectuating the objectives
of the conspiracy. The SA was conceived and created by
Hitler, in 1921, at the very inception of the conspiracy. Hitler
retained the direction of the SA throughout the conspiracy, delegating
responsibility for its leadership to a Chief of Staff. Goering
was an early leader of the SA, and maintained close connection
with it throughout the conspiracy. Hess participated in many
of the early battles of the SA and was leader of an SA group in
Munich. Frank, Streicher, von Schirach, and Sauckel each held
the position of <span class='it'>Obergruppenfuehrer</span> in the SA, a position corresponding
to the rank of Lieutenant General; and Bormann was a
member of the Staff of the SA High Command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The close relationship between the SA and leaders of the Nazi
Party is demonstrated by the fact that the <span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span> (Bearers
of Sovereignty) of the Nazi Leadership Corps were authorized
to call upon the SA for assistance in carrying out particular phases
of the Party program. For example, at page 71 of the Organization
Book of the Nazi Party (1943 edition) the following statement
is made (<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The <span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span> is responsible for the entire political appearance
of the Movement within this zone. The SA leader
of that zone is tied to the directives of the <span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span> in
that respect.</p>

<p>“The <span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span> is the ranking representative of the
Party to include all organizations within his zone. He may
requisition the SA located within his zone for the respective
SA leader if they are needed for the execution of a political
mission. The <span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span> will then assign the mission to
the SA * * *.</p>

<p>“Should the <span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span> need more SA for the execution
of political mission than is locally available, he then applies to
<span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>
the next higher office of sovereignty which, in turn, requests
the SA from the SA office in his sector.” (<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>This close relationship is further shown by an ordinance for the
execution of a Hitler decree (<span class='it'>2383-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The leader of affiliated organizations, as well as the leaders
of the party women’s organization, are subordinate to the
sovereign bearer (<span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span>) politically, functionally,
disciplinarily, and personally.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The formations of the NSDAP, with exception of the SS, for
whom special provisions apply, are subordinated to the sovereign
bearer (<span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span>) politically and in respect to
commitment. Responsibility for the leadership of the units
rests in the hands of the unit leader.” (<span class='it'>2383-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>It was in compliance with the authority of the Leadership Corps
that the SA was used in the seizure of trade union properties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition, the SA demonstrated its close affiliation to the Nazi
Party by participating in various ways in election proceedings. A
pamphlet entitled “The SA,” depicting the history and general
activities of the SA, written by an SA Sturmfuehrer upon orders
from SA Headquarters, declares that the SA stood—</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“at the foremost front of election fights.” (<span class='it'>2168-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Further evidence of the close relationship between the SA and
Nazi leaders is found in the distribution list of the confidential
publication of the Nazi Leadership Corps, which shows that this
strictly confidential magazine was distributed to Lieutenant-Generals
and Major-Generals of the SA. (<span class='it'>2660-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The interest and participation of Nazi leaders in the activities
of the SA is clearly shown in the issues of “<span class='it'>Der SA-Mann</span>” for
the period from 1934 to March 1939 (<span class='it'>3050-A-E-PS</span>). Throughout
these volumes there appear photographs of Nazi leaders participating
in SA activities. The following are descriptions of a few
of these photographs, together with the page numbers upon which
they appear:</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The work of the SA did not end with the seizure of the German
government by the Nazis, but affiliation between the SA and
Nazi leaders continued thereafter. The importance of the SA in
connection with the Nazi Government and control of Germany is
shown by the law of 1 December 1933 entitled, “The Law on Securing
the Unity of Party and State” (<span class='it'>1395-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * The Deputy of the Fuehrer and the Chief of Staff
of SA become members of the Reich Government in order to
insure close cooperation of the offices of the Party and SA
with the public authorities.” (<span class='it'>1395-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Similarly, a decree promulgated by Hitler providing for supervision
of premilitary training by the SA declares:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The offices of the Party and State are to support the SA
in this training program and to value the possession of the
certificate for the SA military insignia.” (<span class='it'>2383-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The complete control of the SA by the Nazis at all times is
shown by the so-called “Roehm Purge” of June 1934 (see <span class='it'>2407-PS</span>).
Roehm had been Chief of Staff of the SA for several years,
and was responsible for the development of SA into a powerful,
organization. SA members were required to take a personal oath
of fidelity to Roehm. But when his policies conflicted with those
of the Nazi leaders, he was removed, murdered, and replaced by
Victor Lutze. This drastic action was accomplished without revolt
or dissension in the ranks of the SA, and with no change in
its objectives or program. The SA remained “a reliable and
strong part of the National Socialist Movement * * * full
<span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>
of obedience and blind discipline,” whose function was to “create
and form the new German citizens.” (<span class='it'>2407-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The importance of the SA in the Nazi plan for the utilization
of the people of Germany is shown in Hitler’s pronouncement
“The Course for the German Person,” which appears in the issue
of “<span class='it'>Der SA-Mann</span>” for 5 September 1936, at page 22. Hitler’s
statement reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The boy, he will enter the Young Volk, and the lad, he will
enter the Hitler Youth, the young man will go into the SA,
in the SS, and in other units, and the SA and SS men will
one day enter into the labor service and from there to the
Army, and the soldier of the Volk will return again into the
Organization of the Movement, the Party, in the SA and SS
and never again will our Volk decay as it once was decayed”.</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Thus the SA was constantly available to the conspirators as an instrument
to further their aims. It was natural that Victor Lutze,
the former Chief of Staff of the SA, in a pamphlet entitled “The
Nature and Tasks of the SA,” declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The SA cannot be independent of the National Socialist
Movement but can only exist as a part of it.” (<span class='it'>2471-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<h3>B. <span class='it'>Participation by the SA in the Conspiracy.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>The principal functions performed by the SA in furtherance of
the objectives of the conspiracy may be classified into four distinct
phases, each of which corresponds with a particular phase in
the progression of the conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first phase consists of the use of the SA and its members
as the instrument for the dissemination of Nazi ideology throughout
Germany. The employment of SA for this purpose continued
throughout the entire period of the conspiracy. In the second
phase, the period prior to the Nazi seizure of power, the SA was a
militant group of fighters whose function was to combat all opponents
of the Party. In the third phase, the period of several
years following the Nazi seizure of power, the SA participated in
various measures designed to consolidate the control of the Nazis,
including the dissolution of the trade unions, the persecution of
the church, and Jewish persecutions. During this period the SA
continued to serve as a force of political soldiers whose purpose
was to combat members of political parties considered hostile to
the Nazi Party. The fourth aspect of SA activities consisted of
its employment as an agency for the building up of an armed force
in Germany in violation of the Treaty of Versailles, and for the
<span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>
preparation of the youth of Germany for the waging of an aggressive
war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>The Propagation of Nazi Doctrine.</span> From the very start
the Nazi leaders emphasized the importance of the SA’s mission
to disseminate Nazi doctrines. The responsibility of propagating
National Socialist ideology remained constant throughout. This
is shown in an excerpt from <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> in which Hitler declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * As the directing idea for the inner training of the
<span class='it'>Sturmabteilung</span>, the intention was always dominant, aside
from all physical education, to teach it to be the unshakeable
convinced defender of the National Socialist idea.” (<span class='it'>2760-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Hitler’s pronouncement as to the function of SA in this respect
became the guiding principle of SA members, for <span class='it'>Mein
Kampf</span> was taken to express the basic philosophy of the SA. The
Organization Book of the Nazi Party declares that the training of
SA members should consist of—</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The training and rearing upon the basis of the teachings
and aims of the Fuehrer as they are put down in ‘Mein
Kampf’ and in the Party program, for all spheres of our life
and our National Socialist ideology.” (<span class='it'>2354-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>The Party Organization Book also declares that the SA is the</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“training and rearing instrument of the Party.” (<span class='it'>2354-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Similarly, in an article which appeared in “<span class='it'>Der SA-Mann</span>”, at
page 1 of the issue of January 1934, the functions of the SA
were set forth as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“First, to be the guaranty of the power of the National
Socialist State against all attacks from without as well as
from within.</p>

<p>“Second, to be the high institute of education of the people
for the living National Socialism.”</p>

</div>

<p>The function of the SA as propagandist of the Party was more
than a responsibility which SA took unto itself. It was a responsibility
recognized by the law of Germany. The law for
“Securing the Unity of Party and State,” promulgated by the
Reich Cabinet in 1933, provided:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The members of the National Socialistic German Labor
Party and the SA (including their subordinate organizations)
as the leading and driving force of the National Socialist
State will bear greater responsibility toward Fuehrer,
people and State.” (<span class='it'>1395-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>As the principal ideology bearers of the Nazi Party SA members
were “the soldiers of an idea,” to use the expression employed
by Nazi writers. Examples of the use of the SA as Nazi
propagandist will be seen in the description of the other functions
performed by the SA. For in each case the SA combined
its propagandist responsibility instrument with the other functions
which it performed in furtherance of the conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Strong-Arm Terrorization of Political Opponents.</span> In the
early stages of the Nazi Movement the SA combined propaganda
with violence along the lines expressed by Hitler in <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Young Movement from the first day, espoused the
standpoint that its idea must be put forward spiritually
but that the defense of this spiritual platform must, if necessary,
be secured by strong-arm means.” (<span class='it'>2760-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>So that the Nazis might better spread their philosophies, the SA
was employed to gain possession and control of the streets for
the Nazis. Its function was to beat up and terrorize all political
opponents. The importance of this function is explained in a
pamphlet written by SA Sturmfuehrer Bayer, upon orders from
SA Headquarters (<span class='it'>2168-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Possession of the streets is the key to power in the State—for
this reason the SA marched and fought. The public
would have never received knowledge from the agitative
speeches of the little Reichstag faction and its propaganda
or from the desires and aims of the Party if the martial
tread and battle song of the SA Companies had not beat the
measure for the truth of a relentless criticism of the state
of affairs in the governmental system. They wanted the
young Movement to keep silent. Nothing was to be read in
the press about the labor of the National Socialists, not to
mention the basic aims of its platform. They simply did not
want to awake any interest in it. However, the martial tread
of the SA took care that even the drowsiest citizens had to
see at least the existence of a fighting troop.” (<span class='it'>2168-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>And in <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> Hitler defined the task of the SA as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“We have to teach the Marxists that the master of the
streets in the future is National Socialism, exactly as it will
once be the Master of the State.” (<span class='it'>2760-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>The importance of the work of SA in the early days of the Movement
was indicated by Goebbels in a speech which appeared in
<span class='it'>Das Archiv</span> in October 1935:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * The inner-political opponents did not disappear
due to mysterious unknown reasons but because the Movement
<span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>
possessed a strong-arm within its organization and the
strongest strong-arm of the Movement is the SA * * *.”
(<span class='it'>3211-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Specific evidence of the activities of the SA during the early period
of the Nazi Movement (1922-31) is to be found in a series
of articles appearing in “<span class='it'>Der SA-Mann</span>” entitled, “SA Battle Experiences
Which We Will Never Forget.” Each of these articles
is an account of a street or meeting-hall battle waged by the SA
against a group of political opponents in the early days of the
Nazi struggle for power. These articles demonstrate that during
this period it was the function of SA to employ physical violence
in order to destroy all forms of thought and expression which
might be considered hostile to Nazi aims or philosophy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The titles of these articles are sufficiently descriptive to constitute
evidence of SA activities. Some of these titles, together
with the page and reference of “<span class='it'>Der SA-Mann</span>” upon which they
appear, follow:</p>

<p><span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span></p>

<p>As an example of the nature of these articles, the article appearing
in the Franken Edition of “<span class='it'>Der SA-Mann</span>” for 30 October
1937, at page 3, is typical. It is entitled: “9 November 1923 in
Nurnberg,” and reads in part as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“We stayed overnight in the Coliseum. Then in the morning
we found out what had happened in Munich. ‘Now a revolution
will also be made in Nurnberg,’ we said. All of a sudden
the Police came from the Maxtor Guard and told us that we
should go home, that the Putsch in Munich failed. We did
not believe that and we did not go home. Then came the
State Police with fixed bayonets and drove us out of the hall.
One of us then shouted ‘Let’s go to the Cafe Habsburg!’ By
the time we arrived, however, the Police again had everything
surrounded. Some shouted then: ‘The Jewish place
will be stormed * * * Out with the Jews!’ Then the
Police started to beat us up. Then we divided into small
groups and roamed through town and wherever we caught
a Red or a Jew we knew, a fist fight ensued.</p>

<p>“Then in the evening we marched, although the Police had
forbidden it, to a meeting in Furth. During the promenade
again the police attempted to stop us. It was all the same to
us. Already in the next moment we attacked the police in
our anger so that they were forced to flee. We marched on to
the Geissmann Hall. There again they tried to stop us.
But the Landsturm, which was also there, attacked the protection
forces like persons possessed, and drove them from
the streets. After the meeting we dissolved and went to the
edge of town. From there we marched in close column back
to Nurnberg. In the Wall Street near the Plaerrer the Police
came again. We simply shoved them aside. They did
not trust themselves to attack, for what would a blood bath
have meant? We decided beforehand not to take anything
from anyone. Also in Furth they had already noticed that
we were up to no good. A large mass of people accompanied
us on the march. We marched with unrolled flags and sang
so that the streets resounded: Comrade reach me your
hand; we want to stand together, even though they have
false impressions, the spirit must not die, Swastika on the
steel helmet, black—white—red armband, we are known as
Storm Troop (SA) Hitler!”</p>

</div>

<p>Through such means the SA was chiefly responsible for destroying
all political elements hostile to the Nazis, including liberalism
and capitalism. This is shown by an article which appeared on 6
<span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span>
January, 1934, at page 1 of “<span class='it'>Der SA-Mann</span>,” entitled “The SA
Man in the New State!”</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The New Germany would not have been without the SA man
and the new Germany would not exist if the SA man
would now, with the feeling of having fulfilled his duty,
quietly and unselfishly and modestly step aside or if the new
State would send him home much like the Moors who had
done his obligations.</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“What has been accomplished up until now, the taking over
of the power in the State and the ejection of those elements
which are responsible for the pernicious developments of the
post war years as bearers of Marxist liberalism, and capitalism
are only the preliminaries, the spring-board for the real
aims of National Socialism.</p>

<p>“Being conscious of the fact that the real National Socialist
construction work would be building in an empty space without
the usurpation of power by Adolf Hitler, the movement
and the SA man as the aggressive bearer of its will primarily
have directed all their efforts thereupon, to achieve the platform
of continued striving and to obtain the fundamental for
the realization of our desires in the State by force * * *</p>

<p>“* * * Out of this comes the further missions of the
SA for the completion of the German revolution. First: To
be the guaranty of the power of the National Socialist State
against all attacks from without as well as within. Second:
To be the high institute of education of the people for the
living National Socialism. Third: to build a bridge over
which the present day German youth can march free and
unhampered as first generation into the formed Third Reich.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Consolidation of Nazi Control of Germany.</span> The Third
function of the SA was to carry out various programs designed
to consolidate Nazi control of the German State, including particularly
the dissolution of the trade unions and the Jewish persecutions.
In the words of an SA officer, it was the function of
the SA to be the “tool for strengthening the structure of the new
State,” and “to clean up” all that was “worth cleaning up.” It
was generally employed, says the SA man, “where communism
and elements hostile to the State still insolently dared to rebel.”
(<span class='it'>2168-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>SA groups were employed to destroy political opposition by
force and brutality where necessary. As an example, an affidavit
of William F. Sollman reads as follows:
<span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * From 1919 until 1933 I was a Social Democrat
and a member of the German Reichstag. Prior to March
11, 1933, I was the editor-in-chief of a chain of daily newspapers,
with my office in Cologne, Germany, which led the
fight against the Nazi Party.</p>

<p>“On March 9, 1933, members of the SS and SA came to my
home in Cologne and destroyed the furniture and my personal
records. At that time I was taken to the Brown House
in Cologne where I was tortured, being beaten and kicked
for several hours. I was then taken to the regular government
prison in Cologne where I was treated by two medical
doctors * * * and released the next day. On March
11, 1933, I left Germany.” (<span class='it'>3221-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Prior to the organization of the Gestapo on a national scale local
SA meeting places were designated as arrest points, and SA members
took into custody Communists and other persons who were
actually or supposedly hostile to the Nazi Party. This activity
is described in an affidavit of Raymond H. Geist, former U. S.
Consul in Berlin:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * At the beginning of the Hitler regime, the only
organization which had meeting places throughout the country
was the SA (Storm Troopers). Until the Gestapo could
be organized on a national scale the thousands of local
SA meeting places became ‘arrest points.’ There were at
least fifty of these in Berlin. Communists, Jews, and other
known enemies of the Nazis party were taken to these points,
and, if they were enemies of sufficient importance, they were
immediately transferred to the Gestapo headquarters.”
(<span class='it'>1759-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>In addition, SA members served as guards at concentration
camps during this consolidation period and participated in
mistreatment of the persons there imprisoned. A report to Hitler
by the public prosecutor of Dresden concerning the <span class='it'>Knollprosse</span>
of one Vogel, who was accused of mistreatment of the
persons imprisoned in a concentration camp, reads as follows
(<span class='it'>787-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The prosecuting authority in Dresden has indicted Oberregierungsrat
Erich Vogel in Dresden (case designation 16
STA 4 107/34) on account of bodily injury while in office.
The following subject matter is the basis of the process:</p>

<p>“Vogel belongs to the Gestapo office of the province of Saxony
since its foundation and is chief of Main section II,
which formerly bore the title ZUB (<span class='it'>Zentralstelle fuer Umsturzbekaempfung</span>)
<span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>
(Central office for combatting overthrow).
In the process of combatting efforts inimical to
the State Vogel carried out several so called borderland actions
in the year 1933 in which a large number of politically
unreliable persons and persons who had become political
prisoners in the border territories were taken into protective
custody (<span class='it'>Schutzhaft</span>) and brought to the Hohnstein
protective custody camp. In the camp serious mistreatment
of the prisoners has been going on at least since summer
of 1933. The prisoners were not only, as in protective
custody camp Bredow near Stettin, beaten into a state of
unconsciousness for no reason with whips and other tools
but were also tortured in other ways, as for instance with
a drip-apparatus especially constructed for the purpose,
under which the prisoners had to stand so long that they
came away with serious purulent wounds of the scalp. The
guilty SA-leaders and SA-men were sentenced to punishment
of six years to nine months of imprisonment by the
main criminal court of the provincial court in Dresden of
15 May 1935 (16 STA. 3431.34). Vogel, whose duties frequently
brought him to the camp, took part in this mistreatment,
insofar as it happened in the reception room of
the camp during completion of the reception formalities,
and in the supply room, during issuing of the blankets. In
this respect it should be pointed out that Vogel was generally
known to the personnel of the camp—exactly because
of his function as head of the ZUB—and his conduct became
at least partly a standard for the above-named conduct of
the SA-leaders and men.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“In his presence, for instance, the SA-men Mutze dealt such
blows to one man, without provocation, that he turned
around on himself. As already stated, Vogel not only took
no steps against this treatment of the prisoners, but he even
made jokes about it and stated that it amused him the way
things were popping here.</p>

<p>“In the supply room Vogel himself took a hand in the beating
amid the general severe mistreatment. The SA-men
there employed whips and other articles and beat the prisoners
in such a manner that serious injuries were produced;
the prisoners partly became unconscious and had to lie in
the dispensary a long time. Vogel was often present in the
supply room during the mistreatment. At least in the following
<span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>
cases he personally laid violent hands upon prisoners.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“* * * the prisoner was laid across the counter in the
usual manner, held fast by the head and arms, and then
beaten for a considerable time by the SA men with whips
and other articles. Along with this Vogel himself took part
in the beating for a time, and after this mistreatment
slapped him again, so that the prisoner appeared green and
blue in the face. The prisoner is the tinsmith Hans Kuehitz,
who bore the nickname Johnny. Upon his departure Vogel
gave the head of the supply room, Truppenfuehrer Meier
from 6 to 8 reichsmarks with the stated reason that the SA
men ‘had sweated so.’ The money was then distributed by
Meier to those SA-comrades who had taken part in the
mistreatment.” (<span class='it'>787-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Similarly, the SA participated in the seizure and dissolution of
the German trade unions in 1933, a measure taken by the Nazis
under the direction of Robert Ley. An official Nazi Party circular
containing an order promulgated by Robert Ley concerning
the program for the seizure of the union properties read as
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“SA, as well as SS, are to be employed for the occupation of
trade union properties and for the taking into protective
custody all personalities who come into the question.”
(<span class='it'>392-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The SA also participated extensively in the Jewish persecutions
conducted by the Nazis. The affidavit of Mr. Geist, former U. S.
Consul in Berlin (<span class='it'>1759-PS</span>) sets forth numerous instances of
attacks upon Jewish-American citizens. Mr. Geist also declares
that on the morning after the Nazis’ acquisition of power, SA
groups roamed the streets of Berlin seizing and beating Jewish
persons and other political opponents of the Nazi Party. Thereafter
SA men participated in many attacks of physical violence
upon Jews, including Jewish-American citizens. In addition,
uniformed SA men were employed as a display of threatening
force in order to coerce Jewish persons to dispose of their property
at greatly reduced values. (<span class='it'>1759-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>SA participation in the Jewish program of 10 to 11 November,
1938, is disclosed in a confidential report of an SA Brigade
Fuehrer to his Group Commander, dated 29 November, 1938

<p class='noindent'>The circulation of these articles was not intended to be confined
to members of the SA. On the contrary, the plan was to educate
the members of the SA with this philosophy, and for the SA in
turn to disseminate it into the minds of the German people. This
fact is demonstrated in the introduction to a series of anti-Jewish
articles entitled “Gravediggers of World Culture,” which began
in the issue of 5 December, 1936, at page 6. This introduction
stated in part as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“We suggest that the comrades especially take notice of this
series of articles and see that they are further circulated.”
(<span class='it'>3050-A-E-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In addition, intensive campaigns were conducted to persuade
the public to purchase and read “<span class='it'>Der SA-Mann</span>,” and various issues
<span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span>
were posted in public places so that the general public might
read them. “<span class='it'>Der SA-Mann</span>” itself contained several photographs
showing particular issues posted upon street bulletin boards.
There are also several photographs showing advertising displays,
one of which reads as follows “<span class='it'>Der SA-Mann</span> belongs in every
house, every hotel, every inn, every waiting room, and every
store” (page 3 of the issue of 31 October, 1936). (<span class='it'>3050-A-E-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In view of such widespread publicity for the objectives and
methods of the SA, it is inconceivable that volunteers for membership
did not know of the criminal character of this organization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>Fostering of Militarism.</span> In the final phase of the SA in
the conspiracy—its participation in the preparation for aggressive
warfare—the SA was again employed to inculcate a particular
Nazi ideology into the minds of the German people. It
was the function of the SA to prepare Germany mentally for the
waging of an aggressive war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At all times, and especially during the period from 1933-39,
SA leaders emphasized to SA members the duty and responsibility
of creating and fostering a militaristic spirit throughout
Germany. In 1933, Hitler established the so-called SA sports
program and at that time, according to Sturmfuehrer Bayer in
his pamphlet “The SA,”</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“the SA was “commissioned to obtain an increase of and
preservation of a warlike power and a warlike spirit as the
expression of an aggressive attitude”. (<span class='it'>2168-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>In 1937, Hitler renewed the so-called sports program and then
declared the program to be a means “for the fostering of a military
spirit” among the German people. (<span class='it'>3050-A-E-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Organization Book of the Party is to the same effect.
The function of the SA is characterized as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“While the political organization of the NSDAP has carried
out the political leadership, the SA is the training and education
instrument of the Party for the realization of the
world-philosophical soldier-like attitude.</p>

<p>“Consequently, the young German in the SA is being inculcated
in the first instance from the standpoint of world
philosophy and character, and trained as the bearer of National
Socialist armed will.” (<span class='it'>3220-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

propaganda material may be gained from their titles, which are
very graphic. A number of articles relate to the Nazi <span class='it'>Lebensraum</span>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>These lists of articles are not exhaustive. These articles are
merely typical of many in similar vein which appear throughout
the issues of “<span class='it'>Der SA-Mann</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>(5) <span class='it'>The Training of German Youth for Aggressive Warfare.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The important responsibility of training the youth of Germany
in the technique of war, and of preparing them physically and
spiritually for the waging of aggressive warfare, was delegated
to the SA. Hitler characterized this task of the SA in these
words:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Give the German Nation six million perfectly trained bodies
in sport, all fanatically inspired with the love for the Fatherland
and trained to the highest offensive spirit and a National
Socialist State will, if necessary, have created an
Army out of them in less than two years.” (<span class='it'>3215-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The military character of the SA is demonstrated by its organizational
structure (<span class='it'>2168-PS)</span>. As appears from the SA organizational
chart, (<span class='it'>Chart Number 8</span>) it was organized into units
closely corresponding to those of the German army. The organizational
scheme consisted of divisions, regiments, battalions,
companies, platoons, and squads. In addition, there were special
units and branches, including cavalry, signal corps, engineer
corps, and medical corps. There were also three officer training
schools (<span class='it'>2168-PS</span>). SA members wore distinctive uniforms
adapted to military functions, bore arms, and engaged in training,
forced marches, and other military exercises. These facts
are disclosed in photographs and articles in “<span class='it'>Der SA-Mann</span>”.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SA members, moreover, were governed by general regulations
which closely resemble service regulations of an armed force
(<span class='it'>2820-PS</span>). According to these regulations, “discipline and
obedience are the foundations as strong as steel for each military
unit.” These regulations further provide for punishment
for disobedience. The punishments provided demonstrate the
militaristic character of the SA. They include the following:

</table>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Preparation for war through the SA training program was
commenced in Germany as early as 1933, but the scope of this program
was not made public because it constituted a violation of
the Treaty of Versailles. The strict secrecy with which the program
was surrounded is shown by an order from the Chief of
Staff of the SA dated 25 July, 1933 (<span class='it'>D-44</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Further to my instruction Z II 1351/33 dated 11 July 33, I
find cause to ask all SA authorities to exercise the greatest
caution with regard to any publicity given to the SA service
not only in the press, but also in the information and news
sheets of the individual SA units.</p>

<p>“Only during the last few days, the Reich Ministry of the
Interior, at the request of the Foreign Office, has given strict
instructions to all Reich authorities according to which the
most severe control is to be exercised on all publications
which might give other countries an opening to construe
German infringements of the terms of the Versailles Treaty.
“As is known from the Geneva negotiations, our opponents
have piled up material collected in Germany and submitted
to them, which they use against us on every occasion during
the conferences.</p>

<p>“From this point of view, the information sheets circulating
among the subordinate SA units cause the liveliest concern.
I hold all higher SA leaders responsible that any such internal
information sheets appearing in the district of their
command are submitted to the most stringent control <span class='it'>before
they go into print</span>, and I feel compelled to draw attention to
the threat of a prosecution for treason, pronounced by official
instructions issued in the last few days, in cases where
such reports, printed no doubt in good faith, are publicized
and therefore exposed to the danger of falling into the wrong
hands.</p>

<p>“On principle, pictures of the technical specialized units of
the SA and SS, in particular of the signals, motorized and
possibly also of the air wings which now exist outside these
formations, are forbidden, such pictures enabling other countries
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>
to prove the alleged formation of technical troop units.”
(<span class='it'>D-44</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Secrecy was also required in the order assigning a <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>
officer to the SA in January, 1934, to assist in the SA Training
Program (<span class='it'>2823-PS</span>). A memorandum from SA Headquarters
dated 20 January, 1934 designates an officer of the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> to
assist in the military training of SA members and goes on to
provide:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“For the purpose of disguise, Lt. Col. Auleb will wear SA
uniform with insignia of rank according to more detailed
regulations of the Supreme SA leaders”. (<span class='it'>2823-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The military training program of the SA was for many years
conducted under the guise of a sports program. This plan was
created by Hitler as early as 1920 in founding what he called the
National Socialist Sport Troop (SA). Hitler’s declaration at
the time of the creation of this sports organization was as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Sport Troop * * * is but the bearer of the military
thought of a free people.” (<span class='it'>3215-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>The fact that the so-called Sports Program was in reality closely
associated with and in fact a means of providing military training
for German youth, is shown by the following characterization
of the program by Lutze, the Chief of Staff of the SA, in an
article written in 1939 (<span class='it'>3215-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * This goal setting also served for the decrees of
the Fuehrer to the SA of 1935 regarding the renewing of, in
1936 regarding the evaluation of, in 1937 regarding the
yearly repetitive exercises of the SA sport badge. Parallel
to this decree of the Fuehrer for the physical betterment and
military training the organizational and development missions
within the SA were met. Out of the conception that the
preservation and intensification of the military power of our
people must especially be requested by military and physical
exercises, the training was especially carried out systematically
in these fields. In 25 schools of the troop and in 3 Reichsfuehrer
schools of the SA yearly 22,000 to 25,000 officers and
non-coms were trained since 1934 in special educational
courses until they possessed the education and examination
certificates. In clearly outlined training directives the training
goals which had to be achieved yearly were given and at the
same time the yearly Reich competitive contests were established.
Hand in hand the training of the Fuehrer Corps and
corresponding organizational measures and the training at
the front proceeded on the broadest basis.” (<span class='it'>3215-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span></p>

<p>The military nature of the Sports Program is likewise demonstrated
by the tests and standards required to obtain the sports
award. The Organization Book of the Party lists these tests as
follows (<span class='it'>2354-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

</div>

<p>In 1939, the SA Sports Program was formally recognized, in a
decree issued by Hitler, as a military training program. At the
same time the SA was openly declared to be an agency for pre-
and post-military training, that is, military training prior to
and following military service in the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> (<span class='it'>2383-PS</span>).</p>

<p>The decree provided in part as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Der Fuehrer. In amplification of my decree of the 15th
February, 1935, and 18th March, 1937, regarding the acquisition
of the SA sport insignia and the yearly repetitive
exercises, I lift the SA sport insignia to the SA military
insignia and make it as a basis for pre-imposed military
training.
<span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span></p>

<p>“I designate the SA as standard bearer of this training.</p>

<p>“These soldiers who honourably were discharged out of the
active military service and who were serviceable soldiers are
to be placed into the Army ranks for the retaining of their
spiritual and physical energy and to be attached to the SA
insofar as no other organization of the Party (the SS,
NSKK, and SFK) have received them for special training.”
(<span class='it'>2383-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>The SA military training program was not confined to its members,
but extended to the entire youth of Germany. Thus the
Chief of Staff of the SA, in re-establishing the sports program
in 1935, declared (<span class='it'>2354-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“In order to give conscious expression to the fostering of a
valiant spirit in all parts of the German people, I further
decide that this SA Sport Insignia can also be earned and
worn by persons who are not members of the movement,
inasfar as they comply racially and ideologically with the
National Socialist requirements”. (<span class='it'>2354-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The pamphlet entitled “The SA”, shows that responsibility for
conducting this nation-wide program was lodged in the operational
main office of the SA (<span class='it'>2168-PS</span>). According to the pamphlet
it was the duty of this office to—</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Prepare the fighting training of the bodies of all Germans
capable of bearing arms (<span class='it'>Wehrfahig</span>) and as preparation
therefore must organize the execution of corporal exercises
(basic physical training) and sports achievements, so that
the widest stratum of the population is laid hold upon and
will be kept in condition to bear arms (<span class='it'>Wehrtuchtig</span>) both
physically and spiritually, as well as ideologically in character
up to greatest old age.” (<span class='it'>2168-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>The extent to which the SA carried the military training program
into the lives of the German people may be seen from the
following excerpt from “Das Archiv” (<span class='it'>3215-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Next to the companies of the SA were the sport badge
associations (SAG) in which all the militaristic nationals
entered who were prepared to voluntarily answer the call
of the SA for the preservation of military proficiency. Up
until now around 800,000 nationals outside of the SA could
successfully undergo the physical betterment as well as the
political military training of the SA on the basis of the SA
sport badge.</p>

<p>“As pronounced proof heretofore it may be shown that alone
13,400 officers and around 30,000 non-coms in the Reserve
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>
Corps of the Wehrmacht from its (SA) own ranks stand at
the disposal of the SA and can be employed at any time for
the direction of SA military forces * * *”. (<span class='it'>3215-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In 1939, the extension of the SA military program to non-SA
members was officially recognized by Hitler. This occurred in
the ordinance for the execution of the Hitler decree of 16 January,
1942:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Every German man who has completed his seventeenth year
and who shows preliminary requirements for honorary service
with the weapon, has the <span class='it'>customary</span> duty to win the SA
military insignia in preparation for military service.</p>

<p>“During the years in the Hitler Youth following his sixteenth
year, he is to prepare himself for the winning of the
SA military insignia.” (<span class='it'>2383-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The SA, in its military training program, was no mere marching
and drilling society. It embraced every phase of the technique
of modern warfare. This appears clearly from the articles
on military training which appear throughout the issues of “<span class='it'>Der
SA-Mann”. The titles of these articles indicate their substance.

<h3>C. <span class='it'>Cooperation with the Wehrmacht in Preparation for Aggression.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Evidence of the SA’s participation in the conspiracy is found
in the care which was taken at all times to coordinate the military
training program of the SA with the requirements of
the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>. As early as 1934, an SA memorandum provided
that the SA chief of training and his subordinates should remain—</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * in direct touch with the respective offices and sections
of the Reich Defense Ministry.” (<span class='it'>2823-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The same memorandum recites that a Lieutenant-Colonel of the
<span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> was assigned to the SA with the duty of participating—</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * in all questions regarding training and organization
* * *.” (<span class='it'>2823-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Another SA memorandum declared that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * permanent liaison between the Reich Defense
Ministry and the Supreme Commander of the SA * * *
has been assured.” (<span class='it'>2821-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Hitler’s words regarding cooperation between <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> and
SA were as follows:
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The requirements of the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> are to be taken into
consideration in organization and training.</p>

<p>“The Chief of Staff of the SA releases the required executionary
directives in agreement with the Commander in
Chief of the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> units. He alone is responsible for
the fulfillment.” (<span class='it'>2383-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>A speech by the Chief of Staff of the SA relating to the technical
and specialized branches of the SA revealed that this opportunity
for collaboration with the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> in specialized military
training was utilized to the utmost:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“In the course of this development also special missions for
military betterment (program) were placed on the SA. The
Fuehrer gave the SA the cavalry and motor training and
called SA Obergruppenfuehrer Littmann as Reich Inspector
with the mission to secure the * * * recruits and requirements
for the German Wehrmacht through the SA. In
close cooperation with parts of the Wehrmacht special certificates
were created for the communication, engineer and medical
units which, like the cavalry certificate of the SA, are
valued as statement of preference for employment in said
units.” (<span class='it'>3215-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>The specialized training given SA members, in accordance with
the requirements of technical branches of the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>, is described
by SA Sturmfuehrer Bayer as follows (<span class='it'>2168-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * On one side the young SA man who enters the
armed forces (<span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>) from his branch, comes prepared
with a multitude of prerequisites which facilitate and speed
up training in technical respects; while on the other side
those very soldiers, having served, who return out of the
armed forces into the SA keep themselves, by constant practice,
in a trained condition physically and mentally and impart
their knowledge to their fellows.</p>

<p>“Thus they contribute a considerable portion to the enhancement
of armed strength (<span class='it'>Wehrkraft</span>) and armed spirit
(<span class='it'>Wehrgeist</span>) of the German people.” (<span class='it'>2168-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>And, with respect to the mounted or cavalry SA—</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * the SA each year is able to furnish many thousands
of young trained cavalrymen to our <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>.
* * * At present the SA cavalry has at its disposal 101
cavalry units in whose schools, year in and year out, young
Germans who are obligated for military service receive the
training which fits him for entrance into a section of troops
which is of their own choosing.” (<span class='it'>2168-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The close relationship between the SA and the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> is
<span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>
shown throughout the issues of “<span class='it'>Der SA-Mann</span>”, which contain
a number of articles on military training written by <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>
officers. The same relationship is shown in many photographs.
For example, in the issue of 1 May, 1937, at page 4, there is a
picture of a <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> formation drawn up in front of an SA
building with SA officers and men in the background. The picture
is entitled—</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Day after day the closed formations of the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>
march in Wurzburg to the subscription places of the SA for
thanksgiving to the nation in order to announce its close relation
with the SA, and to express thanks to the Fuehrer
for making the Reich capable of defense.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Page 2 of the issue of 27 January, 1939, contains a photograph
of the SA Chief of Staff, Lutze, addressing a group of SA men.
The photograph bears the caption, “We will be the bridge between
the Party and the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>.” Page 3 of the issue of
3 February, 1939, reproduces a photograph of General von
Brauchitsch and Chief of Staff Lutze reviewing an SA unit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The close cooperation between the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> and the SA,
and the significance of the SA military training program is shown
by the fact that service in the SA was considered as military
service under the Conscription Law of 1935. The Organization
Book of the Party declared that—</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Equally significant is a suitable education and training
which the SA has accomplished within the yearly classes,
and which have satisfied their arms obligation.” (<span class='it'>3220-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And an article in “Das Archiv” declared—</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It was announced that conscripted SA men and Hitler
Youths can fulfill their military conscription in the SA Regiment
<span class='it'>Feldherrnhalle</span> whose Commander is General Field
Marshall SA Obergruppenfuehrer Goering. The Regiment
for the first time was employed as Regiment of the Luftwaffe
in the occupation of the Sudetenland under its Fuehrer
and Regimental Commander SA Gruppenfuehrer Reimann.”
(<span class='it'>3214-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>There was never any misunderstanding among SA men as to the
reasons which lay behind their military training program. They
were preparing for war and knew it. The purpose of the so-called
“Sports Program” was announced time after time in articles
in “<span class='it'>Der SA-Mann</span>.” For example, the introduction to an
article entitled, “The War of Tomorrow,” which appeared in the
issue of 6 July, 1937, at page 12, declared:
<span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“By decree of the Fuehrer of 18th March, 1937, the SA
Sport Badge was declared as a means for the aggressive
training of the body, for the fostering of a military spirit,
for the retaining of military efficiency and thereby as a basis
for German military power. * * *</p>

<p>“* * * In the following article an attempt is made to
occupy every SA Fuehrer, who does not have the opportunity
due to their profession or many-sided SA services, with
questions concerning military policy and modern war direction,
to give him an overall view of facts, teachings,
opinions and beliefs which today are not without decisive
influence upon the military policy, upon the character of the
coming war and upon the modern national defense.”</p>

</div>

<h3>D. <span class='it'>Participation of the SA in Warfare.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>It would be natural in view of the above quotation, to expect
the SA to have been used as a striking force in the first steps of
the aggressive warfare launched by Germany, and as a basis for
so-called Commando Groups. Such was the case. SA units were
among the first of the Nazi military machine to invade Austria
in the spring of 1938. This fact was proudly announced in an
article appearing in “<span class='it'>Der SA-Mann</span>” for 19 March, 1938, at p.
10, entitled, “We were the First!” Similarly, the SA participated
in the occupation of the Sudetenland (<span class='it'>3214-PS</span>). It was
announced that conscripted SA men and Hitler Youths could
fulfill their military conscription duty in the SA Regiment <span class='it'>Feldherrnhalle</span>,
commanded by General Field Marshall SA Obergruppenfuehrer
Goering. The regiment was employed for the first
time as Regiment of the Luftwaffe in the occupation of the Sudetenland,
under its Fuehrer and Regimental commander SA
Gruppenfuehrer Reimann.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SA participation in the occupation of the Sudetenland is also
shown by an affidavit of Gottlob Berger, a former officer in the
SS who was assigned to the Sudeten-German Free Corps (<span class='it'>3036-PS</span>).
Berger declares—</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * 1. In the fall of 1938 I held the rank and title
of Oberfuehrer in the SS. In mid-September I was assigned
as SS Liaison Officer with Konrad Henlein’s Sudeten
German Free Corps at their headquarters in the castle at
Dondorf outside Bayreuth. In this position I was responsible
for all liaison between the Reichsfuehrer SS Himmler
and Henlein and, in particular, I was delegated to select
from the Sudeten Germans those who appeared to be eligible
<span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span>
for membership in the SS or VT (<span class='it'>Verfuegungs
Truppe</span>). In addition to myself, Liaison Officers stationed
with Henlein included an Obergruppenfuehrer from the
NSKK, whose name I have forgotten, and Obergruppenfuehrer
Max Juettner, from the SA. In addition, Admiral Canaris,
who was head of the OKW Abwehr, appeared at
Dondorf nearly every two days and conferred with Henlein.</p>

<p>“2. In the course of my official duties at Henlein’s Headquarters
I became familiar with the composition and activities
of the Free Corps. Three groups were being formed
under Henlein’s direction: One in the Eisenstein area, Bavaria,
one in the Bayreuth area; one in the Dresden area,
and possibly a fourth group in Silesia. These groups were
supposedly composed of refugees from the Sudetenland who
had crossed the border into Germany, but they actually contained
Germans with previous service in the SA and NSKK
[Nazi Motor Corps] as well. These Germans formed the
skeleton of the Free Corps. On paper the Free Corps had
a strength of 40,000 men. Part of the equipment furnished
to Henlein, mostly haversacks, cooking utensils and blankets,
were supplied by the SA.” (<span class='it'>3036-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The adaptability of the SA to whatever purpose was required of
it is demonstrated by its activities subsequent to the outbreak of
the war. During the war the SA continued to carry out its military
training program, but it also engaged in various other functions:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The General of the SA, Wilhelm Schepmann, gave further
orders to increase the employment of the SA in the homeland
war territories because of the requirements of total war employment.
This was done in numerous business conferences
with Fuehrers of the SA-Divisions.</p>

<p>“As a result of these conferences, as well as of measures already
carried out earlier for the totalization of the war employment,
the SA now has placed 86 per cent of its main
professional Fuehrer Corps at disposal at the Front even
though the war missions of the SA have increased in the
fields of pre-military training, the SA penetration into new
territorial parts of the Reich, the air war employment, the
State and national guard etc., during war time.</p>

<p>“The SA as a whole has given at present an even 70% of its
nearly million members to the Wehrmacht.” (<span class='it'>3219-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>The SA even extended its activities into Poland:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“By command of the General of the SA, the ‘SA-Unit General
Government’ was established, the command of which
<span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span>
was taken over by Governor-General SA Obergruppenfuehrer
Dr. Frank.” (<span class='it'>3216-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>An affidavit of Walter Schellenberg, bureau chief in the RSHA,
reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * From the beginning of 1944 on the SA also participated
in many of the functions which had previously
been entrusted only to the SS, SIPO and Army, for instance
the guarding of concentration camps, the guarding of prisoner
of war camps, the supervision over forced laborers in
Germany and occupied areas. This cooperation of the SA
was planned and arranged for by high officials in Berlin as
early as the middle of 1943 * * *.” (<span class='it'>3232-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<h3>E. <span class='it'>Special Responsibility of Goering for the SA Program.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Hermann Goering participated in the conspiracy in his capacity
as an SA member and leader. In 1923, Goering became Commander
of the entire SA. A few months later Goering participated
in the so-called Munich Putsch. SA troops participated
with him in this action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Goering’s intention to employ the SA as a terroristic force to
destroy political opponents is shown by a speech made by him on
3 March, 1933, at a Nazi demonstration in Frankfurt Am Main
(<span class='it'>1856-PS</span>). Goering spoke as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Certainly, I shall use the power of the State and the police
to the utmost, my dear Communists! So you won’t draw any
false conclusions by the struggle to the death in which my
fist will grasp your necks, I shall lead with those down
there. Those are the Brown Shirts.” (<span class='it'>1856-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>The importance of the SA under Goering in the early stages of
the Nazi movement is shown by a letter written to Goering by
Hitler (<span class='it'>3259-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“My dear Goering:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“When in November 1923 the Party tried for the first time
to conquer the power of the State, you as Commander of
the SA created within an extraordinarily short time that instrument
with which I could bear that struggle. Highest
necessity had forced us to act, but a wise providence at that
time denied the success. After receiving a grave wound you
again entered the ranks as soon as circumstances permitted
as my most loyal comrade in the battle for power. You contributed
essentially to creating the basis for the 30th of
January. Therefore, at the end of a year of the National
Socialist Revolution, I desire to thank you wholeheartedly,
<span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span>
my dear Party Comrade Goering, for the great values which
you have for the National Socialist Revolution and consequently
for the German people.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“In cordial friendship and grateful appreciation.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:4em;'>“Yours,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;'>“(s)&nbsp;&nbsp;Adolf Hitler!” (<span class='it'>3259-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Although Goering did not retain command of the SA, he at all
times maintained a close affiliation with the organization. This
is shown by the photographs of Goering participating in SA activities
which have been mentioned previously. In 1937, Goering
became Commander of the <span class='it'>Feldherrnhalle</span> Regiment of the SA.
This was the Regiment which was employed in the occupation of
the Sudetenland. (<span class='it'>3214-PS</span>)</p>

which particularly struck the correspondent was the one question
asked by the SS prisoners: Why are we charged as war criminals?
What have we done except our normal duty?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The evidence which follows will answer that question. It will
show that just as the Nazi Party was the core of the conspiracy,
so the SS was the very essence of Nazism. For the SS was the
elite group of the Party, composed of the most thorough-going adherents
of the Nazi cause, pledged to blind devotion to Nazi
principles, and prepared to carry them out without any question
and at any cost. It was a group in which every ordinary value
was so subverted that today its members can ask, what is there
unlawful about the things we have done?</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the evidence of the conspirators’ program for aggressive
war, for concentration camps, for the extermination of the Jews,
for enslavement of foreign labor and illegal use of prisoners of
war and for the deportation and Germanization of inhabitants of
conquered territories, in all this evidence the name of the SS runs
like a thread. Again and again that organization and its components
are referred to. It performed a responsible role in each
of these criminal activities, because it was and indeed had to be
a criminal organization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The creation and development of such an organization was essential
for the execution of the conspirators’ plans. Their sweeping
program and the measures they were prepared to use and
did use, could be fully accomplished neither through the machinery
of the government nor of the Party. Things had to be
<span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>
done for which no agency of government and no political party
even the Nazi Party, would openly take full responsibility. A
specialized type of apparatus was needed—an apparatus which
was to some extent connected with the government and given official
support, but which, at the same time, could maintain a
quasi-independent status so that all its acts could be attributed
neither to the government nor to the Party as a whole. The SS
was that apparatus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like the SA, it was one of the seven components or formations
of the Nazi Party referred to in the Decree on Enforcement of
the Law for Securing the Unity of Party and State of 29 March
1935 (<span class='it'>1725-PS</span>). But its status was above that of the other formations.
As the plans of the conspirators progressed, it acquired
new functions, new responsibilities, and an increasingly more important
place in the regime. It developed during the course of the
conspiracy into a highly complex machine, the most powerful in
the Nazi State, spreading its tentacles into every field of Nazi
activity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The evidence which follows will be directed toward showing
first, the origin and early development of the SS; second, how it
was organized—that is, its structure and its component parts;
third, the basic principles governing the selection of its members
and the obligations they undertook; and finally, its aims and
the means used to accomplish them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The history, organization, and publicly announced functions of
the SS are not controversial matters. They are not matters to be
learned only from secret files and captured documents. They
were recounted in many publications, circulated widely throughout
Germany and the world—in official books of the Nazi Party
itself, and in books, pamphlets, and speeches by SS and State
officials published with SS and Party approval. Throughout this
section there will be frequent reference to and quotation from
a few such publications.</p>

<h3>A. <span class='it'>Origin and General Functions of the SS.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Origin.</span> The first aim of the conspirators was to gain a
foothold in politically hostile territory, to acquire mastery of the
street, and to combat any and all opponents with force. For that
purpose they needed their own private, personal police organization.
The SA was created to fill such a role. But the SA was
outlawed in 1923. When Nazi Party activity was again resumed
in 1925, the SA remained outlawed. To fill its place and to play
the part of Hitler’s own personal police, small mobile groups
<span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>
known as protective squadrons—<span class='it'>Schutzstaffel</span>—were created.
This was the origin of the SS in 1925. With the reinstatement
of the SA in 1926, the SS for the next few years ceased to play
a major role. But it continued to exist as an organization within
the SA—under its own leader, however—the Reichsfuehrer SS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This early history of the SS is related in two authoritative publications.
The first is a book by SS Standartenfuehrer Gunter
d’Alquen entitled “The SS” (<span class='it'>2284-PS</span>). This pamphlet of some
30 pages, published in 1939, is an authoritative account of the
history, mission, and organization of the SS. As indicated on
its fly leaf, it was written at the direction of the Reichsfuehrer
SS, Heinrich Himmler. Its author was the editor of the official
SS publication “<span class='it'>Das Schwarze Korps</span>”. The second publication
is an article by Himmler, entitled “Organization and Obligations
of the SS and the Police.” It was published in 1937 in a booklet
containing a series of speeches or essays by important officials
of the Party and the State, and known as “National Political
Course for the Armed Forces from 15 to 23 January 1937”.
(<span class='it'>1992-A-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>As early as 1929, the conspirators recognized that their plans
required an organization in which the main principles of the
Nazi system, specifically the racial principles, would not only be
jealously guarded but would be carried to such extremes as to
inspire or intimidate the rest of the population. Such an organization
would also have to be assured complete freedom on the
part of the leaders and blind obedience on the part of the members.
The SS was built up to meet this need. The following
statement appears on page 7 of d’Alquen’s book, “<span class='it'>Die SS</span>” (<span class='it'>2284-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“On the 16th of January, 1929, Adolf Hitler appointed his
tested comrade of long standing, Heinrich Himmler, as
Reichsfuehrer SS. Heinrich Himmler assumed charge therewith
of the entire <span class='it'>Schutzstaffel</span> totaling at the time 280 men,
with the express and particular commission of the Fuehrer
to form of this organization an elite troop of the Party, a
troop dependable in every circumstance. With this day the
real history of the SS begins as it stands before us today in
all its deeper essential features, firmly anchored into the national
Socialist movement. For the SS and its Reichsfuehrer,
Heinrich Himmler, its first SS man, have become inseparable
in the course of these battle-filled years.” (<span class='it'>2284-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Carrying out Hitler’s directive, Himmler proceeded to build up
out of this small force of men an elite organization which, to use
d’Alquen’s words, was “composed of the best physically, the most
<span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>
dependable, and the most faithful men in the Nazi movement.”
As d’Alquen further states, at page 12 of his book:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“When the day of seizure of power had finally come, there
were 52,000 SS men, who in this spirit bore the revolution
in the van, marched into the new State which they began to
help form everywhere, in their stations and positions, in
profession and in science, and in all their essential tasks.”
(<span class='it'>2284-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>General Functions.</span> The conspirators now had the machinery
of government in their hands. The initial function of
the SS—that of acting as their private army and personal police
force—was thus completed. But its mission had in fact really
just begun. That mission is described in the Organizations book
of the NSDAP for 1943 as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“<span class='it'>Missions</span></p>

<p>“The most original and most eminent duty of the SS is to
serve as the protector of the Fuehrer.</p>

<p>“By order of the Fuehrer its sphere of duties has been amplified
to include the internal security of the Reich.” (<span class='it'>2640-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This new mission—protecting the internal security of the regime—was
somewhat more colorfully described by Himmler in
his pamphlet, “The SS as an Anti-bolshevist Fighting Organization,”
published in 1936 (<span class='it'>1851-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“We shall unremittingly fulfill our task, the guaranty of the
security of Germany from the interior, just as the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>
guarantees the safety, the honor, the greatness, and
the peace of the Reich from the exterior. We shall take
care that never again in Germany, the heart of Europe, will
the Jewish-Bolshevistic revolution of subhumans be able to
be kindled either from within or through emissaries from
without. Without pity we shall be a merciless sword of justice
for all those forces whose existence and activity we
know, on the day of the slightest attempt, may it be today,
may it be in decades or may it be in centuries.” (<span class='it'>1851-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This conception necessarily required an extension of the duties
of the SS into many fields. It involved, of course, the performance
of police functions. But it involved more. It required participation
in the suppression and extermination of all internal
opponents of the regime. It meant participation in extending the
regime beyond the borders of Germany, and eventually, participation
in every type of activity designed to secure a hold over
<span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span>
those territories and populations which, through military conquest,
had come under German domination.</p>

<h3>B. <span class='it'>Organization and Branches of the SS.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>The expansion of SS duties and activities resulted in the creation
of several branches and numerous departments and the development
of a highly complex machinery. Although those
various branches and departments cannot be adequately described
out of the context of their history, a few words about the
structure of the SS may be useful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For this purpose reference is made to the chart depicting the
organization of the SS as it appeared in 1945. This chart was
examined by Gottlob Berger, formerly Chief of the SS Main Office,
who stated in an attached affidavit that it correctly represents
the organization of the SS (<span class='it'>Chart Number 3</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Supreme Command of the SS.</span> At the very top of the
chart is Himmler, the Reichsfuehrer SS, who commanded the entire
organization. Immediately below, running across the chart
and down the right hand side, embraced within the heavy line,
are the twelve main departments constituting the Supreme Command
of the SS. Some of these departments have been broken
down into the several offices of which they were composed, as indicated
by the boxes beneath them. Other departments have
not been so broken down. It is not intended to indicate that there
were not subdivisions of these latter departments as well. The
breakdown is shown only in those cases where the constituent
offices of some department may have a particular significance in
this case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These departments and their functions are described in two
official Nazi publications: The first is the Organizations Book
of the NSDAP for 1943, at pages 419-422 (<span class='it'>2640-PS</span>). The second
is an SS manual, which bears the title: “The Soldier Friend—Pocket
Diary for the German Armed Forces—Edition D: Waffen
SS” (<span class='it'>2825-PS</span>). It was prepared at the direction of the Reichsfuehrer
SS and issued by the SS Main Office for the year ending
1942. In addition, the departments are listed in a directory of
the SS published by one of the Main Departments of the SS
(<span class='it'>2769-PS</span>). This document was found in the files of the Personal
Staff of the Reichsfuehrer SS. It is entitled “Directory for the
<span class='it'>Schutzstaffel</span> of the NSDAP, 1 November 1944”, marked “Restricted”,
and bears the notation “Published by SS Fuerhungshauptamt,
Kommandant of the General SS. Berlin—Wilmersdorf.”
<span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Returning to the chart, following down the central spine from
the Reichsfuehrer SS to the regional level, the Higher SS and
Police Leaders, the supreme SS commanders in each region are
reached. Immediately below these officials is the breakdown of
the organization of the Allgemeine or General SS. To the left
are indicated two other branches of the SS—the Death Head
Units (<span class='it'>Totenkopf Verbaende</span>) and the Waffen SS. To the right
under the HSS Pf is the SD. All of which, together with the SS
Police Regiments, are specifically named in the Indictment (Appendix
B) as being included in the SS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Principal Branches of the SS.</span> Up to 1933 there were no
such specially designated branches. The SS was a single group,
made up of “volunteer political soldiers.” It was out of this
original nucleus that new units developed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) <span class='it'>The Allgemeine SS.</span> The Allgemeine (General) SS was
the main stem from which the various branches grew. It was
composed of all members of the SS who did not belong to any of
the special branches. It was the backbone of the entire organization.
The personnel and officers of the Main Departments of the
SS Supreme Command were members of this branch. Except for
high ranking officers and those remaining in staff capacities, as in
the Main Offices of the SS Supreme Command, its members were
part-time volunteers. Its members were utilized in about every
phase of SS activity. They were called upon in anti-Jewish pogroms
of 1938; they took over the task of guarding concentration
camps during the war; they participated in the colonization and
resettlement program. In short, the term “SS” normally meant
the General SS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was organized on military lines as will be seen from the
chart (<span class='it'>Chart Number 3</span>), ranging from district and subdistrict
down through the regiment, battalion, and company, to the
platoon. Until after the beginning of the war it constituted numerically
the largest branch of the SS. In 1939 d’Alquen, the
official SS spokesmen, said, in his book, “The SS” (<span class='it'>2284-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The strength of the General SS, 240,000 men, is subdivided
today into 14 corps, 38 divisions, 140 infantry regiments, 19
mounted regiments, 14 communication battalions and 19
engineer battalions as well as motorized and medical units.
This General SS stands fully and wholly on call as in the
fighting years, except for one small part of the chief leaders
and men. The corps, which are presently led by a Lt. General
or Major General, are subdivided into divisions, regiments,
battalions and companies.” (<span class='it'>2284-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Similar reference to the military organization of the General
SS will be found in Himmler’s speech, “Organization and Obligations
of the SS and the Police” (<span class='it'>1992-A-PS</span>), and in the Organizations
Book of the NSDAP for 1943 (<span class='it'>2640-PS</span>). Members of
this branch, however,—with the exception of certain staff personnel—were
subject to compulsory military service. As a result of
the draft of members of the General SS of military age into the
Army, the numerical strength of presently active members considerably
declined during the war. Older SS men and those working
in or holding high positions in the Main Departments of the
Supreme Command of the SS remained. Its entire strength during
the war was probably not in excess of 40,000 men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) <span class='it'>The SD.</span> The second component to be mentioned is the Security
Service of the Reichsfuehrer SS, almost always referred to
as the SD. Himmler described the SD in these words (<span class='it'>1992-A-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I now come to the Security Service (SD); it is the great
ideological intelligence service of the Party and, in the long
run, also that of the State. During the time of struggle for
power it was only the intelligence service of the SS. At that
time we had, for quite natural reasons, an intelligence service
with the regiments, battalions and companies. We had to
know what was going on on the opponents side, whether the
Communists intended to hold a meeting today or not, whether
our people were to be suddenly attacked or not, and similar
things. I separated this service already in 1931 from the
troops, from the units of the General SS, because I considered
it to be wrong. For one thing, the secrecy is endangered,
then the individual men, or even the companies, are too likely
to discuss everyday problems.” (<span class='it'>1992-A-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Although, as Himmler put it, the SD was only the intelligence
service of the SS during the years preceding the accession of the
Nazis to power, it became a much more important organization
promptly thereafter. It had been developed into such a powerful
and scientific espionage system under its chief, Reinhard Heydrich,
that on 9 June 1934, just a few weeks before the bloody
purge of the SA, it was made, by decree of Hess, the sole intelligence
and counter-intelligence agency of the entire Nazi Party
(<span class='it'>2284-PS</span>). Its organization and numbers, as they stood in 1937,
were thus described by Himmler (<span class='it'>1992-A-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Security Service was already separated from the troop
in 1931 and separately organized. Its higher headquarters,
coincide today with the <span class='it'>Oberabschnitte</span> and <span class='it'>Abschnitte</span>—[that
is, the districts and subdistricts of the General SS]—and
<span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>
it has also field offices, its own organization of officials
with a great many Command Posts, approximately three to
four thousand men strong, at least when it is built up.”
(<span class='it'>1992-A-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Up to 1939 its headquarters was the SS Main Security Office
(<span class='it'>Sicherheitshauptamt</span>), which became amalgamated in 1939 into
the Reich Main Security Office (or RSHA), one of the SS main departments
shown on the chart (<span class='it'>Chart Number 3</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The closer and closer collaboration of the SD with the Gestapo
and Criminal Police (Kripo), which eventually resulted in the
creation of the RSHA, as well as the activities in which the SD
engaged in partnership with the Gestapo are discussed in Section
6 on the Gestapo. The SD was, of course, at all times an integral
and important component of the SS. But it is more practicable to
deal with it in connection with the activities of the whole repressive
police system with which it functioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) <span class='it'>The Waffen SS.</span> The third component is the Waffen SS, the
combat arm of the SS, which was created, trained, and finally
utilized for the purposes of aggressive war. The reason underlying
the creation of this combat branch was described in the
Organizations Book of the Nazi Party for 1943:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Waffen SS originated out of the thought: to create for
the Fuehrer a selected long service troop for the fulfillment
of special missions. It was to render it possible for members
of the General SS, as well as for volunteers who fulfill
the special requirements of the SS, to fight in the battle for
the evolution of the National Socialist idea, with weapon in
hand, in unified groups, partly within the framework of the
Army.” (<span class='it'>2640-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The term “Waffen SS” did not come into use until after the
beginning of the war. Up to that time there were two branches
of the SS composed of fulltime, professional, well-trained soldiers:
the so-called <span class='it'>SS Verfuegungstruppe</span>, translatable perhaps
as “SS Emergency Troops”; and the <span class='it'>SS Totenkopf Verbaende</span>,
the “Death Head Units.” After the beginning of the war, the
units of the <span class='it'>SS Verfuegungstruppe</span> were brought up to division
strength, and new divisions were added to them. Moreover, parts
of the SS Death Head Units were formed into a division, the
<span class='it'>SS Totenkopf Division</span>. All these divisions then came to be known
collectively as the “Waffen SS”.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This development is traced in the Organization Book of the
Nazi Party for 1943:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The origin of the Waffen SS goes back to the decree of 17
March 1933, establishing the “Stabswache” with an original
<span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>
strength of 120 men. Out of this small group developed the
later-called SS Verfuegungstruppe (SS Emergency Force).”
(<span class='it'>2640-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The function and status of the <span class='it'>SS Verfuegungstruppe</span> are described
in a Top Secret Hitler order, 17 August 1938 (<span class='it'>647-PS</span>).
That order provides, in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“II. The Armed Units of the SS.</p>

<p>“A. (The <span class='it'>SS Verfuegungstruppe</span>)</p>

<p>“1. The <span class='it'>SS Verfuegungstruppe</span> is neither a part of the Wehrmacht
nor a part of the police. It is a standing armed unit
exclusively at my disposal. As such and as a unit of the
NSDAP its members are to be selected by the Reichsfuehrer
SS according to the philosophical and political standards
which I have ordered for the NSDAP and for the <span class='it'>Schutzstaffel</span>.
Its members are to be trained and its ranks filled
with volunteers from those who are subject to serve in the
army who have finished their duties in the obligatory labor
service. The service period for volunteers is for 4 years. It
may be prolonged for <span class='it'>SS Unterfuehrer</span>. Such regulations are
in force for SS leaders. The regular compulsory military
service (par. 8 of the law relating to military service) is
fulfilled by service of the same amount of time in the <span class='it'>SS
Verfuegungstruppe</span>.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“III. Orders for the Case of Mobilization.</p>

<p>“A. The employment of the <span class='it'>SS Verfuegungstruppe</span> in case of
mobilization is a double one.</p>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>“1.</span><p class='listPara'>By the Supreme Commander of the Army within the
wartime army. In that case it comes completely under
military laws and regulations, but remains a unit of the
NSDAP politically.</p>
</div>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>“2.</span><p class='listPara'>In case of necessity in the interior according to my orders,
in that case it is under the Reichsfuehrer SS and
chief of the German Police.</p>
</div>

<p>“In case of mobilization I myself will make the decision about
the time, strength and manner of the incorporation of the <span class='it'>SS
Verfuegungstruppe</span> into the wartime army, these things will
depend on the inner-political situation at that time.” (<span class='it'>647-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately after the issuance of this decree, this militarized
force was employed with the Army for aggressive purposes—the
taking over of the Sudetenland. Following this action, feverish
preparations to motorize the force and to organize new units,
<span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>
such as antitank, machine gun, and reconnaissance battalions,
were undertaken pursuant to further directives of the Fuehrer.
By September 1939, the force was fully motorized, its units had
been increased to division strength, and it was prepared for combat.
These steps are described in the National Socialist Yearbook
for the years 1940 (<span class='it'>2164-PS</span>) and 1941 (<span class='it'>2163-PS</span>). The Yearbook
was an official publication of the Nazi Party, edited by
Reichsleiter Robert Ley and published by the Nazi Party publishing
company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the launching of the Polish invasion, and as the war
progressed, still further divisions were added. The Organizations
Book of the Nazi Party for 1943 (<span class='it'>2640-PS</span>) lists some eight divisions
and two infantry brigades as existing at the end of 1942.
This was no longer a mere emergency force. It was an SS army
and hence came to be designated as the “Waffen SS” that is,
“Armed” or “Combat” SS. Himmler referred to the spectacular
development of this SS combat branch in his speech at Posen on
4 October 1943 to SS Gruppenfuehrers, in these terms:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * Now I come to our own development, to that of
the SS in the past months. Looking back on the whole war,
this development was fantastic. It took place at an absolutely
terrific speed. Let us look back a little to 1939. At
that time we were a few regiments, guard units (<span class='it'>Wachverbande</span>)
8 to 9,000 strong,—that is, not even a division, all in
all 25 to 28,000 men at the outside. True, we were armed,
but really only got our artillery regiment as our heavy arm
two months before the war began.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“In the hard battles of this year, the Waffen-SS has been
welded together in the bitterest hours from the most varied
divisions and sections, and from these it formed: bodyguard
units (<span class='it'>Leibstandarte</span>), military SS (<span class='it'>Verfuegungstruppe</span>),
Death’s Head Units, and then the Germanic SS. Now when
our ‘Reich’, Death’s Head Cavalry Divisions and ‘Viking’
Divisions were there, everyone knew in these last weeks:
‘Viking’ is at my side, ‘Reich’ is at my side, ‘Death’s Head’
is at my side,—‘Thank God’ now nothing can happen to us.”
(<span class='it'>1919-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The transformation of a small emergency force into a vast combat
Army did not result in any separation of this branch from the
SS. Although tactically under the command of the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>
while in the field, it remained as much a part of the SS as any
other branch of that organization. Throughout the war it was recruited,
trained, administered and supplied by the main offices
<span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span>
of the SS Supreme Command. Ideologically and racially its members
were selected in conformity with SS standards, as shown by
the recruiting standards of the Waffen SS published in the SS
manual, “The Soldier Friend” (<span class='it'>2825-PS</span>). A section of that
manual entitled “The Way to the Waffen SS,” reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Today at last is the longed-for day of the entrance examination
where the examiners and physicians decide whether or
not the candidate is ideologically and physically qualified to
do service in the Armed Forces SS.</p>

<p>“Everyone has acquainted himself with the comprehensive
Manual for the Waffen SS; the principal points are as follows:</p>

<p>“1. Service in the Armed Forces SS counts as military service.
Only volunteers are accepted.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“3. Every pure-blooded German in good health between the
ages of 17 and 45 can become a member of the armed forces
SS. He must meet all the requirements of the SS, must be
of excellent character, have no criminal record, and be an
ardent adherent to all Nazi socialist doctrines. Members of
the <span class='it'>Streifendienst</span> and of the <span class='it'>Landdienst</span> of the Hitler Youth
will be given preference because their aptitudes, qualities and
schooling are indicative that they have become acquainted
very early with the ideology of the SS.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“In all cases of doubt or difficulty the recruiting offices of
the Waffen SS will advise and aid volunteers. They have
branches over the entire Reich, always at the seat of the
Service Command Headquarters, and work closely with the
recruiting of the Waffen SS in the Main Office (SS Hauptamt)
of the Reichsfuehrer SS.” (<span class='it'>2825-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The recruiting activities of the SS Main Office are illustrated by
its recruiting pamphlet, “The SS Calls You,” an elaborate illustrated
booklet containing full information covering the Waffen
SS:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“If you answer the call of the Waffen SS and volunteer to
join the ranks of the great Front of SS Divisions, you will
belong to a corps which has from the very beginning been
directed toward outstanding achievements, and, because of
this fact, has developed an especially deep feeling of comradeship.
You will be bearing arms with a corps that embraces
the most valuable elements of the young German generation.
Over and above that you will be especially bound
to the National Socialist ideology.” (<span class='it'>3429-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The SS Main Office, through which these recruiting activities
were conducted, was one of the principal departments of the SS
Supreme Command. It is shown on the chart (the second box
from the left) (<span class='it'>Chart Number 3</span>). In the breakdown of that
department, shown by the boxes underneath, will be found the
central recruiting office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other departments of the Supreme Command performed other
functions in connection with the Waffen SS. The SS Operational
Headquarters (<span class='it'>SS Fuehrungshauptamt</span>)—the fifth box
from the left—contains the Command Headquarters of the Waffen
SS (<span class='it'>Chart Number 3</span>). The functions of this department are
thus defined in the SS Manual, “The Soldier Friend”:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the <span class='it'>Fuehrungshauptamt</span> the command office of the Waffen
SS handles tasks of military leadership: Training and
organization of the units of the Waffen SS, supply of the
troops with arms, equipment and ammunition, procurement
of motor vehicles for the Waffen SS and General SS, personnel
and disciplinary affairs.” (<span class='it'>2825-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The SS Legal Main Office (<span class='it'>Hauptamt SS Gericht</span>) (indicated
on the chart by the second box from the top on the right hand
side within the heavy embracing line—(<span class='it'>Chart Number 3</span>)) controlled
the administration of courts-martial and discipline within
the Waffen SS. The secret Hitler order of 17 August 1938
(<span class='it'>647-PS</span>) had, it is true, provided that in the event of mobilization
the SS militarized forces should come completely under military
laws and regulations. That provision was modified by subsequent
enactments: The decree of 17 October 1939 relating to
special jurisdiction in penal matters for members of the SS and
for members of police groups on special tasks (<span class='it'>2946-PS</span>); and
the decree of 17 April 1940, entitled “Second Decree for the Implementation
of the Decree Relating to a Special Jurisdiction in
Penal Matters for Members of the SS” (<span class='it'>2947-PS</span>). These two
decrees established a special jurisdiction in penal matters for
various classes of SS members, including members of the SS
militarized units, in cases which would ordinarily fall under the
jurisdiction of the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>; and created special SS courts to
handle such cases under the direction of the SS Legal Main Office.
Thus, in the vital question of discipline, as well as in recruiting,
administration, and supply, the Waffen SS was subject to the SS
Supreme Command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The place of the Waffen SS as an integral part of the entire
SS organization was strongly emphasized by Himmler in his address
to officers of the <span class='it'>SS Leibstandarte</span> “Adolf Hitler” on the
“Day of Metz”:
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“You must also consider the following: I cannot concentrate
my mind solely on—now, please don’t become conceited—the
most splendid part of the SS because it <span class='it'>is</span> the most positive
part and because the trade you are following <span class='it'>is</span> the most positive
and most manly. I cannot do that. I must always have
the <span class='it'>entire</span> SS in my mind.</p>

<p>“If I did not see this part, I would deny life to this most
positive and most manly part of our activity; i.e., the Armed
SS. I would deny your life. Because this armed SS will live
only if the entire SS is alive. If the entire corps is actually
an order which lives according to these laws and realizes that
one part cannot exist without the other—you are unimaginable
without the General SS, and the latter is not imaginable
without you. The police is not imaginable without the SS,
nor are we imaginable without this executive branch of the
state which is in our hands.” (<span class='it'>1918-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>d</span>) <span class='it'>The Totenkopf Verbaende.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The fourth component to be mentioned is the SS Death Head
Units (<span class='it'>SS Totenkopf Verbaende</span>). Their origin and purpose are
succinctly described by d’Alquen on page 20 of his book, “<span class='it'>Die SS</span>”:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The SS Death Head Units form one part of the garrisoned
SS. They arose from volunteers of the General SS who were
recruited for the guarding of concentration camps in 1933.</p>

<p>“Their mission, aside from the indoctrination of the armed
political soldier, is guarding enemies of the State who are held
in concentration camps.</p>

<p>“The SS Death Head Units obligate their members to 12
years service. It is composed mainly of men who have already
fulfilled their duty to serve in the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>. This time of
service is counted completely.” (<span class='it'>2284-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Since the Death Head Units, like the <span class='it'>SS Verfuegungstruppe</span>,
were composed of well trained professional soldiers, they were
also a valuable nucleus for the Waffen SS. The secret Hitler order
of 17 August 1938 (<span class='it'>647-PS</span>) provided for this task in the event
of mobilization. The <span class='it'>Totenkopf Verbaende</span> were to be relieved
from the duty of guarding concentration camps and transferred
as a skeleton corps to the <span class='it'>SS Verfuegungstruppe</span>. Section II C,
subparagraph 5, of that order provides: “5. <span class='it'>Regulations for the
case of the Mobilization</span>.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The <span class='it'>SS-Totenkopf Verbaende</span> form the skeleton corps for
the reinforcement of the <span class='it'>SS-Totenkopf Verbaende</span> (police reinforcement),
and will be replaced in the guarding of the
concentration camps by members of the General SS who are
over 45 years of age and had military training.
<span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span></p>

<p>“The skeleton corps—which up to now were units of the two
replacement units for the short time training of the reinforcement
of the <span class='it'>SS-Totenkopf Verbaende</span>—will be transferred
to the <span class='it'>SS-Verfuegungstruppe</span> as skeleton crews of the
replacement units for that unit.” (<span class='it'>647-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>e</span>) <span class='it'>The SS Polizei Regimente.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The final component specifically referred to in the Indictment is
the SS Police Regiments. The SS eventually succeeded in assuming
controls over the entire Reich Police. Out of the police, special
militarized forces were formed, originally SS Police Battalions,
and later expanded to SS Police Regiments. Himmler, in his Posen
speech, declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Now to deal briefly with the tasks of the regular uniformed
police and the Sipo [the Security Police] they still cover the
same field. I can see that great things have been achieved.
We have formed roughly 30 police regiments from police
reservists and former members of the police—police officials,
as they used to be called. The average age in our police battalions
is not lower than that of the security battalions of the
Armed Forces. Their achievements are beyond all praise. In
addition, we have formed Police Rifle Regiments by merging
the police battalions of the ‘savage peoples.’ Thus we did not
leave these police battalions untouched but blended them in
the ratio of about 1 to 3.” (<span class='it'>1919-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The results of this blend of militarized SS police and “savage
peoples” will be seen in the evidence, subsequently referred to, of
the extermination actions conducted by them in the Eastern territories.
These exterminations which were so successful and so
ruthless that even Himmler could find no words adequate for their
eulogy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Unity of the Organization.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Each of the various components described above played its part
in carrying out one or more functions of the SS. The personnel
composing each differed. Some were part-time volunteers; others
were professionals enlisted for different periods of time. But every
branch, every department, every member was an integral part of
the whole organization. Each performed his assigned role in the
manifold tasks for which the organization had been created. No
better witness to this fact could be called upon than the Reichsfuehrer
SS, whose every endeavor was to insure the complete unity
of the organization. The following words are taken from his Posen
speech:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“It would be an evil day if the SS and police fell out. It would
<span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span>
be an evil day if the Main Offices, performing their tasks well
meaningly but mistakenly made themselves independent by
each having a downward chain of command. I really think
that the day of my overthrow would be the end of the SS. It
must be, and so come about, that this SS organization with
all its branches—the General SS which is the common basis
of all of them, the Waffen-SS, the regular uniformed police
(<span class='it'>Ordnungspolizei</span>), the SIPO (with the whole economic administration,
schooling, ideological training, the whole question
of kindred), is, even under the tenth Reichsfuehrer-SS
<span class='it'>one</span> bloc, <span class='it'>one</span> body, <span class='it'>one</span> organization.</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The regular uniformed police and SIPO, General-SS and
Waffen-SS must now gradually amalgamate too, just as this
is and must be the case within the Waffen-SS. This applies
to matters concerning filling of posts, recruiting, schooling,
economic organization, and medical services. I am always
doing something towards this end, a bond is constantly being
cast around these sections of the whole to cause them to grow
together. Alas, if these bonds should ever be loosened—then
everything—you may be sure of this—would sink back
into its old insignificance in one generation, and in a short
space of time.” (<span class='it'>1919-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<h3>C. <span class='it'>Selection, Training, and Obligations of Members.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>To understand this organization, the theories upon which it was
based must be kept clearly in mind. The underlying philosophy of
the SS, the principles by which its members were selected, and the
obligations imposed upon them furnish the key to all its activities.
It is necessary, therefore, to consider them in some detail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>The Racial Basis of the SS.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) <span class='it'>The SS as a racial and biological elite.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The fundamental principle of selection was what Himmler
called that of Blood and Elite. The SS was to be the living embodiment
of the Nazi doctrine of the superiority of Nordic blood,
and of the Nazi conception of a master race. In Himmler’s own
words, the SS was to be a “National Socialist Soldierly Order of
Nordic Men” (<span class='it'>1992-A-PS</span>). In describing to the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> the
reasons behind his emphasis on racial standards of selection and
the manner in which they were carried out, he said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * Accordingly, only good blood, blood which history
has proved to be leading and creative and the foundation
<span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>
of every state and of all military activities, only Nordic blood,
can be considered. I said to myself that should I succeed in
selecting from the German people for this organization as
many people as possible a majority of whom possess this desired
blood, in teaching them military discipline and, in time,
the understanding of the value of blood and the entire ideology
which results from it, then it will be possible actually to create
such an elite organization which would successfully hold
its own in all cases of emergency.” (<span class='it'>1992-A-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Further on in the same speech, Himmler described the selection
of candidates for his organization:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * They are extremely thoroughly examined and
checked. Of 100 men we can use on the average of 10 or 15,
no more. We ask for the political reputation record of his
parents, brothers and sisters, the record of his ancestry as far
back as 1750 and naturally the physical examination and his
records from the Hitler Youth. Further, we ask for a record
of hereditary health showing that no hereditary disease exists
in his parents and in his family. Last, but perhaps most important,
is a certification of the race commission. This examining
commission is composed of SS leaders, anthropologists
and physicians.” (<span class='it'>1992-A-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This same strict selection process for the SS was somewhat similarly
described in the Organizations Book of the Nazi Party for
1943:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“<span class='it'>Selection of Members</span></p>

<p>“For the fulfillment of these missions a homogeneous firmly
welded fighting force has been created bound by ideological
oaths, whose fighters are selected out of the best Aryan
humanity.</p>

<p>“The conception of the value of the blood and soil serves as
directive for the selection into the SS. Every SS man must
be deeply imbued with the sense and essence of the National
Socialist Movement. He will be ideologically and physically
trained so that he can be employed individually or in groups
in the decisive battle for the National Socialist ideology.</p>

<p>“Only the best and thoroughbred Germans are suited for
commitment, in this battle. Therefore it is necessary that an
uninterrupted selection is retained within the ranks of the
SS, first superficially, then constantly more thoroughly.”
(<span class='it'>2640-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The creation of a racial and biological elite had some very practical
reasons behind it. The conspirators’ plans for conquest and
exploitation of the conquered territories required the development
<span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span>
of a Nazi aristocracy which would dominate Germany and Europe
for centuries to come. That purpose was explicitly stated by
Himmler in his Posen speech:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“One thing must be clear, one thing I would like to say to
you today: the moment the war is over, we will really begin
to weld together our organization, this organization which we
have built up for 10 years, which we imbued and indoctrinated
with the first most important principles during the 10
years before the war. We must continue to do this—we,—if
I may say so, we older men—for twenty years full of toil and
work, so that a tradition 30, 35, 40 years, a generation, may be
created. Then this organization will march forward into the
future young and strong, revolutionary and efficient to fulfill
the task of giving the German people, the Germanic people,
the superstratum of society which will combine and hold together
this Germanic people and this Europe, and from which
the brains which the people need for industry, farming, politics,
and as soldiers, statesmen and technicians, will emerge.
In addition this superstratum must be so strong and vital that
every generation can unreservedly sacrifice two or three sons
from every family on the battle-field, and that never-the-less
the continued flowing of the bloodstream is assured.”
(<span class='it'>1919-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>He forcibly made the same point in his address to officers of the
<span class='it'>SS Leibstandarte</span> “Adolph Hitler” on the “Day of Metz”:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The ultimate aim for these 11 years during which I have
been the Reichsfuehrer SS has been invariably the same: To
create an order of good blood which is able to serve Germany.
Which unfailingly and without sparing itself can be made
use of because the greatest losses can do no harm to the vitality
of this order, the vitality of these men, because they will
always be replaced. To create an order which will spread the
idea of nordic blood so far that we will attract all nordic blood
in the world, take away the blood from our adversaries, absorb
it so that never again, looking at it from the viewpoint
of grand policy, nordic blood in great quantities and to an extent
worth mentioning will fight against us. We must get it
and the others cannot have it. We never gave up the ideas
and the aim conceived so many years ago. Everything we
did has taken us some distance further on the way. Everything
we are going to do will lead us further on the way.”
(<span class='it'>1918-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Since the SS was to be made a Nazi aristocracy which would
dominate not only Germany but the world for centuries to come,
<span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span>
it was essential that the SS stock be perpetuated. To insure the
continuance of this good blood, the first step was to limit marriages
of SS men to women meeting the same requirements as to health,
descent, and ideological background as the SS man himself. This
was accomplished by an order of the Reichsfuehrer SS issued on
31 December 1931. This SS marriage law is set out in full in
d’Alquen’s Book, “The SS,” (<span class='it'>2284-PS</span>). But proper marriages
were not enough without children. A series of orders took care
of that. On 13 September 1936, Himmler issued an order entitled
“Foundation of the Organization ‘<span class='it'>Lebensborn e.V.</span>’ ”, published
in the SS manual, “The Soldier Friend”:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“As early as December 13, 1934, I wrote to all SS leaders and
declared that we have fought in vain if political victory was
not to be followed by victory of birth of good blood. The question
of multiplicity of children is not a private affair of the
individual but his duty towards his ancestors and our people.</p>

<p>“The SS has taken the first step in this direction long ago with
the engagement and marriage decree of December 1931. However,
the existence of sound marriage is futile if it does not
result in the creation of numerous descendants.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The minimum amount of children for a good sound marriage
is four. Should unfortunate circumstances deny a married
couple their own children, then every SS leader should adopt
racially and hereditarily valuable children, educate them in
the spirit of National Socialism, let them have an education
corresponding to their ability.” (<span class='it'>2825-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>The drive for perpetuation of SS stock was continued. A further
order of Himmler, issued on 28 October 1939, directed to the entire
SS and the Police, is also published in the SS manual, “The
Soldier Friend”:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The old saying that only those who have children can die in
peace must again become acknowledged truth in this war,
especially for the SS.</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“Though in other times it may perhaps be considered an infraction
of necessary social standards and conventions, German
women and girls of good blood can fulfill a high obligation
by bearing children out of wedlock to soldiers going to
the front, whose eventual return or death for Germany lies
entirely in the hands of fate—not out of promiscuity but out
of a deep sense of ethics.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“Let us never forget that the victory of the sword and of the
<span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>
spilled blood of our soldiers remains fruitless, if it is not succeeded
by the victory of the child and the colonizing of conquered
soil.” (<span class='it'>2825-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>A final order designed to assure continuance of good SS blood was
issued on 15 August 1942, entitled “SS Orders to the Last Sons”,
also published in “The Soldier Friend”:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“You SS men have been withdrawn from the front lines by
order of the Fuehrer because you are the last sons. This measure
has been taken because the people and the State have an
interest in seeing that your families do not die out.</p>

<p>“It has never been the nature of SS men to submit to a fate
without attempting to effect a change. It is your duty to see
to it that you are no longer the last sons by producing as many
children of good blood as possible.” (<span class='it'>2825-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These orders were not the product of some benevolent theorist
in eugenics who was interested in large and happy SS families for
their own sake. They stemmed from a basic idea of the conspiracy,
the plan to insure Germany’s continued capacity to wage war for
generations. Himmler put this theory very bluntly in his speech
to officers of the <span class='it'>SS Leibstandarte</span> “Adolf Hitler” on the “Day of
Metz”:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * If we once had not enough sons, those who will
come after us will have to become cowards. A nation which
has an average of four sons per family can venture a war;
if two of them die, two transmit the name. The leadership of
a nation having one son or two sons per family will have to
be faint-hearted at any decision on account of their own experience,
because they will have to tell themselves: We cannot
afford it. Look at France, which is the best example.
France had to accept from us a dictate.” (<span class='it'>1918-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) <span class='it'>The SS as an exterminator of “inferior” races.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Domination of Europe through a Nazi Elite required more, however,
than the positive side of racism—that is, the building up of
a numerous “biologically superior” group. It necessarily meant
also the destruction of other races. The SS had to be, and was,
taught not merely to breed, but to exterminate. In a speech delivered
at Kharkov in April 1943, Himmler declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“We have—I would say, as very consistent National Socialists—taken
the question of blood as our starting point. We
were the first really to solve the problem of blood by action,
and in this connection by problem of blood, we of course do
not mean anti-semitism. Antisemitism is exactly the same as
delousing. Getting rid of lice is not a question of ideology. It
is a matter of cleanliness. In just the same way, anti-semitism
<span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span>
for us, will soon have been dealt with. We shall soon be deloused.
We have only 20,000 lice left, and then the matter is
finished within the whole of Germany.” (<span class='it'>1919-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>But it was not merely against Jews that SS efforts were directed.
All non-Nordic races were similarly condemned. In his Posen
speech, Himmler stated this basic principle of the SS:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“One basic principle must be the absolute rule for the SS men:
We must be honest, decent, loyal and comradely to members
of our own blood and to nobody else. What happens to a Russian,
to a Czech, does not interest me in the slightest. What
other nations can offer in the way of good blood of our type,
we will take, if necessary, by kidnapping their children and
raising them here with us. Whether nations live in prosperity
or starve to death interests me only so far as we need them
as slaves for our culture; otherwise, it is of no interest to me.
Whether 10,000 Russian females fall down from exhaustion
while digging an antitank ditch interests me only insofar as
the antitank ditch for Germany is finished.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“That is what I want to instill into this SS and what I believe
I have instilled in them as one of the most sacred laws of the
future.” (<span class='it'>1919-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) <span class='it'>Indoctrination of members in SS racial theories.</span> These
were the principles which were publicly reiterated, over and over
again, so that the newest recruit was thoroughly steeped in them.
In his Kharkov speech to the commanding officers of three Waffen
SS divisions, Himmler strongly insisted on indoctrinating all SS
members in his theories of the racial struggle.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“This is what is important for us as SS men, for our province
of duty and our mission (it is a task additional to those of the
whole German armed forces and the whole German people):
That is what I would like to impress upon you. This is what
I beg you as commanding officers, as chiefs and as leaders, to
teach the young men again and again in their ideological instruction.
That is what I demand and exact of you—that you
really concern yourself with the man, the young fellow of 17
or 18 who comes to us, and with many who are in our ranks
not as volunteers but as conscripts. I ask you to look after
them, and guide them, and not let them go before they are
really saturated with our spirit and are fighting as the old
guard fought before us—that is what I request and demand
of you.</p>

<p>“We have only one task—to stand firm and carry on the racial
struggle without mercy.” (<span class='it'>1919-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>This function of the SS men in the racial struggle was publicly
proclaimed in the Organizations Book of the NSDAP for 1943:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“He openly and relentlessly fights against the most dangerous
enemies of the State: Jews, Freemasons, Jesuits and political
clergymen.” (<span class='it'>2640-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>The Obligation of Obedience.</span> Indoctrination of the organization
in principles of racial hatred was not enough. The members
had to be ready and willing tools, prepared to carry out tasks
of any nature, however distasteful, illegal or inhuman. Absolute
obedience was the necessary second foundation stone of the SS.
The Organizations Book of the NSDAP for 1943 thus describes
this fundamental requirement:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Obedience must be unconditional. It corresponds to the conviction
that the National Socialist ideology must reign supreme.
He who is possessed by it and fights for it passionately
subjects himself voluntarily to the obligation to obey.
Every SS man is prepared, therefore, to carry out blindly
every order which is issued by the Fuehrer or which is given
by his superior, irrespective of the heaviest sacrifices involved.”
(<span class='it'>2640-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>The same point was emphasized by Himmler in the Posen speech:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I would like here to state something clearly and unequivocally.
It is a matter of course that the little man must obey.
It is even more a matter of course that all the senior leaders
of the SS, that is the whole corps of Gruppenfuehrers, are
a model of blind obedience.” (<span class='it'>1919-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>The SS as a Terroristic Agency.</span> A necessary corollary of
these two fundamental principles of race and of blind obedience
was ruthlessness. Subsequent evidence of SS activities will prove
how successfully the SS learned the lesson it was taught. The SS
had to and did develop a reputation for terror which was carefully
cultivated. Himmler himself attested to it as early as 1936 in a
speech publicly delivered at the Peasant’s Day Rally and subsequently
published and circulated in pamphlet form under the title
“The SS as an Anti-bolshevist Fighting Organization”:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I know that there are some people in Germany who become
sick when they see their black coats. We understand the reason
for this and do not expect that we shall be loved by too
many.” (<span class='it'>1851-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>Continuance of the Elite and Voluntary Character of the SS.</span>
The role which the SS was to play required that it remain constantly
the essence of Naziism, and that its elite Nazi quality never
<span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>
be diluted. For this reason the SS was for a time temporarily
closed to new members, and those who had proved unfit were
weeded out. Himmler described this process in his article “Organization
and Obligations of the SS and the Police” (<span class='it'>1992-A-PS</span>).
Referring to the influx of new adherents to the Party and
its organizations in 1933, he said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“A very difficult question confronted us at that time. It was
a question of deciding whether to close the Party and its organizations
to further membership and thus remain pure in
quality but small in volume, or of opening them to further
membership to increase their volume.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The SS too was endangered by this menace. Therefore I closed
it while some of the other organizations accepted as great a
number of people as possible. This way I had the SS again
under my control in April and said: We shall accept no more
people. From the end of 1933 to the end of 1935 we expelled
all those of the newly accepted members who proved unsuitable.”
(<span class='it'>1992-A-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>These standards were not abandoned later. Indeed, in 1943 the
Organizations Book of the Nazi Party stated that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The demands with respect to racial purity of the SS are being
increased every year.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And in the same year, 1943, Himmler emphasized this point in a
letter written to Kaltenbrunner (<span class='it'>2768-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>This letter from the Reichsfuehrer SS, which bears the date
24 April 1943, states in part as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Referring again to the matter which I discussed some time
ago, i.e., the admission of SIPO officials into the SS. I wish
to clarify again: I want an admission only if the following
conditions are fulfilled:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right95percent'>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>“1.</span><p class='listPara'>If the man applies freely and voluntarily;</p>

</div>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“I beg you not only to act accordingly in the future, but
especially also that numerous admissions into ranks of the
SS in the past be reexamined and revised according to these
instructions.” (<span class='it'>2768-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(5) <span class='it'>Method of Acquiring Membership in the SS.</span> The normal
<span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span>
method by which membership in the SS was attained was discussed
by Himmler in his article, “Organization and Obligations
of the SS and Police”:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The age groups in the SS are as follows: With 18 years the
young man enters the SS. He is first an applicant, after three
months he takes the oath on the Fuehrer and thus becomes a
candidate (<span class='it'>Anwaerter</span>). As a candidate during the first year
he takes examinations for his SA sport insignia and his bronze
sport insignia. At the age of 19 or 19½, according to the time
of his acceptance, he is conscripted for the labor service and
subsequently for the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>. After two more years he
comes back from the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> unless he remains there as
a prospective noncommissioned officer or reenlists. If he returns
to us, he is still candidate. In these weeks he is especially
thoroughly instructed in ideology. The first year is for him
a period of elementary ideological indoctrination. In these
weeks following his return from the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> he receives
special instruction about the marriage law and all other laws
pertaining to the family, and the honor laws. On the 9th of
November, following his return from the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>, he becomes
an SS man in the true sense. The Reichsfuehrer of the
SS is just as much an SS man in the sense of the SS organization
as the common man at the front. On this 9th of November
he is awarded the dagger, and at this occasion he promises
to abide by the marriage law and the disciplinary laws of
the SS, since the family is also subject to these laws. From
this day on he has the right and the duty to defend his honor
with a weapon as laid down by the honor laws of the SS.
The applicants and candidates do not yet have this right.
The SS man remains in the so-called active General SS until
his 35th year. From his 35th to his 45th year he is in the SS
reserve, and after his 45th year in the <span class='it'>Stammabteilung</span> of
the SS, identified by the grey color patch.” (<span class='it'>1992-A-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The oath to the Fuehrer, referred to by Himmler in the passage
just quoted, appears in the SS recruiting pamphlet, “The SS Calls
You”:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Oath of the SS Man:</p>

<p>“I swear to you, Adolf Hitler, as Fuehrer and Reichschancellor,
loyalty and bravery. I vow to you, and to those you

<h3><span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>D. <span class='it'>Criminal Aims and Activities of the SS.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>The Purge of 20[<a href='#purge'><span class='it'>sic</span></a>] June 1934.</span> Proof of the elite Nazi quality
and thorough reliability of the SS, the test by which it won its
spurs, occurred on 30 June 1934, when it participated in the purge
of the SA and other opponents or potential opponents of the Nazi
regime. That was the first real occasion for use of this specialized
organization which could operate with the blessing of the Nazi
State but outside the law. In an affidavit signed and sworn to in
Nurnberg on 19 November 1945, Wilhelm Frick says, referring
to the victims of that purge:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“They were just killed on the spot. Many people were killed—I
don’t know how many—who actually did not have anything
to do with the putsch. People who just weren’t liked very well,
as for instance, Schleicher, the former Reich Chancellor, were
killed * * * The SS was used by Himmler for the execution
of these orders to suppress the putsch.” (<span class='it'>2950-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Himmler referred to this same event in his Posen speech:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Just as we did not hesitate on June 20,[<a href='#himm'><span class='it'>sic</span></a>] 1934, to do the duty
we were bidden, and stand comrades who had lapsed, up
against the wall and shoot them, so we have never spoken
about it and will never speak about it.” (<span class='it'>1919-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It was in recognition of its services in this respect that the SS
was elevated to the status of a component of the Party equal in
rank to the SA and other similar branches. The following announcement
appeared on page 1 of the <span class='it'>Voelkischer Beobachter</span> of
26 July 1934:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Reich press office announces the following order of the
Fuehrer.</p>

<p>“In consideration of the greatly meritorious service of the
SS, especially in connection with the events of 30 June 1934,
I elevate it to the standing of an independent organization
within the NSDAP.</p>

<p>“Munch 20 July 1934.” (<span class='it'>1857-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Functions as a Repressive Police Organization.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the first steps essential to the security of any regime is
control of the police. The SS was the type of organization which
the conspirators needed for this purpose. Their aim was to fuse
the SS and police, and to merge them into a single, unified repressive
force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shortly after the seizure of power the conspirators began to
develop as part of the state machinery, secret political police
forces. These originated in Prussia with the Gestapo, established
<span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span>
by decree of Goering in April 1933, and were duplicated in the
other German States. (This development is discussed in Section
6 on the Gestapo.) By 1934 Himmler, the Reichsfuehrer SS, had
become the chief of these secret political police forces in each of
the German states except Prussia, and deputy chief of the Prussian
Gestapo. In that capacity he infiltrated these forces with members
of the SS until a virtual identity of membership was assured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 17 June 1936, by Decree on the Establishment of a Chief of
the German Police (<span class='it'>2073-PS</span>), the new post of Chief of the German
Police was created in the Ministry of the Interior. Under the
terms of the decree, Himmler was appointed to this post with the
title of “Reichsfuehrer SS and Chief of the German Police in the
Ministry of the Interior.” The combination of these two positions,
that of leadership of the SS and head of all the police forces in the
Reich, was no accident but was intended to establish a permanent
relation between the two bodies and not a mere “transitory fusion
of personnel.” The significance of the combination of these two
positions was referred to by Hitler in the preamble to his secret
order of 17 August 1938:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“By means of the nomination of the Reichsfuehrer SS and
Chief of the German Police in the Ministry of the Interior on
June 17th, 1936 (<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span> I, page 487), I have created
the basis for the unification and reorganization of the
German Police.</p>

<p>“With this step, the <span class='it'>Schutzstaffeln</span> of the NSDAP, which were
under the Reichsfuehrer SS and Chief of the German Police
even up to now, have entered into close connection with the
duties of the German Police.” (<span class='it'>647-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Upon his appointment, Himmler immediately proceeded to reorganize
the entire Reich Police Force, designating two separate
branches: (1) the regular uniformed police force (<span class='it'>Ordnungspolizei</span>,
or Orpo), and (2) the Security Police (<span class='it'>Sicherheitspolizei</span>,
or Sipo). The Sipo was composed of all criminal police organizations
in the Reich and all the secret political police forces, or Gestapo.
This reorganization was achieved by the Decree Assigning
Functions in the Office of the Chief of the German Police (<span class='it'>1551-PS</span>).
To be head of the Sipo, that is the criminal police and Gestapo,
Himmler appointed Reinhard Heydrich, who was at that time the
Chief of the SD. Thus, through Himmler’s dual capacity as leader
of the SS and as Chief of the Police, and through Heydrich’s dual
capacity as head of the Sipo and as chief of the SD, a unified personal
command of the SS and Security Police Forces was achieved.
But further steps toward unification were later taken. In 1939,
the Security Police and the SD were combined in a single department,
<span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>
the Reich Security Main Office, commonly referred to as the
RSHA. (The details of the organization of the RSHA are discussed
in Section 6 on the Gestapo.) The important point to be observed
is this: The newly created Reich Security Main Office was not a
mere department of the Government. It was a dual body: an
agency of the government, organizationally placed in the Department
of the Interior, and at the same time one of the principal
departments of the SS, organizationally placed in the Supreme
Command of the SS. (cf. the chart of the SS organization (<span class='it'>Chart
Number 3</span>)). The following description of the RSHA appears in
the Organizations Book of the NSDAP for 1943:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The RSHA handles all the organizational, personnel, management
and technical affairs of the Security Police and the
SD. In addition, it is the central office of the State Police and
criminal police executive, as well as the central directorate of
the intelligence net of the SD.” (<span class='it'>2640-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The position of the RSHA in the Supreme Command of the SS is
also similarly described in the SS manual, “The Soldier Friend”.
(<span class='it'>2825-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was not merely the Gestapo and the Criminal Police which
came under the sway of the SS. The regular uniformed police as
well were affected. For, like the RSHA, the Department of the
Regular Police (<span class='it'>Ordnungspolizei</span>, or Orpo), was not merely a department
in the Ministry of the Interior, but also simultaneously
in the Supreme Command of the SS. Its position in the SS is indicated
by the seventh box on the chart of the SS organization (<span class='it'>Chart
Number 3</span>). The following description of the Department of the
Regular Police appears in the Organizations Book of the NSDAP
for 1943:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The sphere of duties of the Main Office of the <span class='it'>Ordnungspolizei</span>
includes police administration as well as the management
and direction of the protective police (<span class='it'>Schutzpolizei</span>) of the
Reich, the Gendarmes, the protective police of the community,
the water protection police, the air protection police, the fire
protection police, the protective groups in the occupied territories,
the colonial police, the volunteer fire department, the
compulsatory and youth fire departments, the technical aid
and the technical SS and police academy.” (<span class='it'>2640-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The position of this Department in the SS Supreme Command is
also similarly described in the SS Manual, “The Soldier Friend”.
(<span class='it'>2825-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>This unity of the Command was not a mere matter of the highest
headquarters. It extended down to the operating level. As the
chart shows, the Higher SS and Police Leader in each region, who
<span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>
was directly subordinate to Himmler, had under his command both
the Security Police and the regular, uniformed police (<span class='it'>Chart Number
3</span>). These forces were subject to his orders as well as to those
of the RSHA and the Department of the Regular Police respectively.
This position of the Higher SS and Police Leader is described
in the Organizations Book of the NSDAP for 1943. (<span class='it'>2640-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>SS control of the police was, however, not only a matter of organization
and of unified command. Unity of personnel was also
in large measure achieved. Vacancies occurring in the police forces
were filled by SS members; police officials retained in the force
were urged to join the SS; and schools operated by the SS were the
required training centers for police as well as SS officials. These
measures are described in Himmler’s article, “Organization and
Obligations of the SS and the Police” (<span class='it'>1992-A-PS</span>). They are also
described in an authoritative book on the police and on the SS,
entitled “The German Police,” written by Dr. Werner Best, a Ministerial
Director in the Ministry of the Interior and a department
head in the Security Police and published in 1940. It bears on its flyleaf
the imprimatur of the Nazi Party and is listed in the official
list of National Socialist Party bibliography. Chapter 7 from that
book is reproduced in document (<span class='it'>1852-PS</span>). Reference is also
made to the order of the Reichsfuehrer SS and Chief of the German
Police of 23 June 1938, entitled “Acceptance of Members of
the Security Police into the SS” (<span class='it'>1637-PS</span>). In that order provision
was made for admitting members of the Security Police
into the SS upon certain conditions. The preamble of the order
states that it was issued “with the aim of fusing members of the
German Police with the ‘<span class='it'>Schutzstaffel</span>’ of the National Socialist
German Workers Party into one uniformly turned out State Protective
Corps of the National Socialist Reich” (<span class='it'>1637-PS</span>). Parenthetically,
it should be observed that even this aim was not sufficient
to cause a relaxation of SS admission standards since the
order provided that, to be admitted as an SS member, personnel
of the Security Police were obliged to fulfill the general requirements
of the SS (its racial and ideological standards).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through this unity of organization and personnel, the SS and
the police became identified in structure and in activity. The resulting
situation was described by Best as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Thus the SS and the Police form a unit, both in their structure
and in their activity, although their individual organizations
have not lost their true individuality and their position
in the larger units of the Party and State administration
* * *”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p><span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span></p>

<p>“In the relationship between the Police and the SS, the principle
of the ‘orderly’ penetration of an organization of the
National order has been realized for the first time to the final
outcome through the supporters of the National Socialist
movement”. (<span class='it'>1852-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>As Himmler stated in his address to the officers of <span class='it'>SS-Leibstandarte</span>
“Adolph Hitler” on the “Day of Metz”:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I want to tell you: In the entire Waffen-SS we must begin
to view the other great activity of the entire SS (<span class='it'>Gesamt-SS</span>)
and entire Police. We must see to it that you consider the
activity of the man in the green uniform as just as valuable
as the activity you yourself are engaged in. You have to consider
the work of the SD man or the man of the Security Police
as a vital part of our whole work just like the fact that
you can carry arms”. (<span class='it'>1918-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Through the police the SS was in a position to carry out a large
part of the functions assigned to it. The working partnership between
Gestapo, the criminal police, and the SD, under the direction
of the Reichsfuehrer SS, resulted in the ultimate in repressive
and unrestrained police activity. (cf. the discussion in Section 6
on the Gestapo.) It must be remembered that the Gestapo activities
were but one aspect of SS functions—one part of the whole
criminal SS scheme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Functions and Activities with Respect to Concentration
Camps.</span> Control over the police, however, was not enough. Potential
sources of opposition could be tracked down by the SD. Suspects
could be seized by the criminal police and Gestapo. But those
means alone would not assure the complete suppression of all opponents
and potential opponents of the regime. For this purpose
concentration camps were invented, and the SS was given large
responsibility in that system.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) <span class='it'>Criminal activities of SS guards and camp personnel.</span> The
first requirement of the camps was for guard and administrative
personnel. Part-time volunteer members of the <span class='it'>Allgemeine SS</span>
were originally utilized as guards. But part-time volunteers could
not adequately serve the need of the extensive and long-range
program that was planned. Hence, beginning in 1933 full-time
professional guard units (the <span class='it'>SS Totenkopf Verbaende</span>) were
organized. Their very name (“Death Head Units”) and their
distinguishing insignia, the skull and cross bones, appropriately
marked the type of activity in which they engaged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the war, members of the <span class='it'>Allgemeine SS</span> resumed the
function of guarding the camps which they had undertaken when
<span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span>
the camps were created. This was provided for in the Hitler order
of 17 August 1938 (<span class='it'>647-PS</span>) directing the substitution of <span class='it'>Allgemeine
SS</span> members for the Death Head Units in the event
of mobilization. That substitution took place. In reviewing the
events of the period between 1938 and 1940, significant for the
SS, the National Socialist Yearbook of 1940 congratulated the
<span class='it'>Allgemeine SS</span> on the performance of its new mission:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“However, not only the garrisoned parts of the SS were
employed. Also the General SS were brought forth for special
missions. Thousands of younger and older SS comrades were
employed for the strengthening of the police and for the
guarding of concentration camps and have faithfully fulfilled
their duty throughout the weeks.” (<span class='it'>2164-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is unnecessary to repeat the evidence of wholesale brutalities,
tortures, and murders committed by SS guards. These were
not sporadic crimes committed by irresponsible individuals. They
were a part of a definite and calculated policy, which necessarily
resulted from SS philosophy, and which was carried out from the
initial creation of the camps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Himmler bluntly explained to the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> in 1937 the prevailing
view of the SS as to the inmates of concentration camps:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“It would be extremely instructive for everyone, some members
of the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> were already able to do so, to inspect
such a concentration camp. Once they have seen it, they are
convinced of the fact that no one had been sent there unjustly;
that it is the offal of criminals and freaks. No better demonstration
of the laws of inheritance and race, as set forth
by Doctor Guett, exists than such a concentration camp.
There you can find people with hydrocephalus, people who
are cross-eyed, deformed, half-Jewish, and a number of
racially inferior products. All that is assembled there. Of
course, we distinguish between those inmates who are only
there for a few months for the purpose of education, and
those who are to stay for a very long time. On the whole,
education consists of discipline, never of any kind of instruction
on an ideological basis, for the prisoners have, for the
most part, slave-like souls; and only very few people of real
character can be found there.” (<span class='it'>1992-A-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Even these “slave-like souls,” however, might be redeemed by
SS hygienic measures. For, as Himmler continued:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The discipline thus means order. The order begins with
these people living in clean barracks. Such a thing can really
only be accomplished by us Germans, hardly another nation
would be as humane as we are. The laundry is frequently
<span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span>
changed. The people are taught to wash themselves twice
daily, and the use of a toothbrush with which most of them
have been unfamiliar.” (<span class='it'>1992-A-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Despite this callous jest to the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>, all pretense was swept
away in Himmler’s speech to his own Gruppenfuehrers at Posen:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I don’t believe the Communists could attempt any action,
for their leading elements, like most criminals, are in our
concentration camps. And here I must say this—that we
shall be able to see after the war what a blessing it was for
Germany that, in spite of all the silly talk about humanitarianism,
we imprisoned all this criminal substratum of the
German people in concentration camps: I’ll answer for that.”
(<span class='it'>1919-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Certainly there was no “silly humanitarianism” in the manner
in which SS men performed their task. An illustration of their
conduct, not in 1944 or 1945 but in 1933, is shown in four reports
relating to the deaths of four different inmates of the Concentration
Camp Dachau between May 16 and 27, 1933. Each report
is signed by Winterberger, the Public Prosecutor of the District
Court in Munich, and addressed to the Public Prosecutor of the
Supreme Court of Munich. The first (<span class='it'>641-PS</span>) 1 June 1933,
relates to the death of Dr. Alfred Strauss, a prisoner in protective
custody in Dachau. That report states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“On May 24, 1933 the 30 year old, single, attorney at law,
Dr. Alfred Strauss from Munich who was in the concentration
camp Dachau as a prisoner under protective custody
was killed by 2 pistol shots from SS man Johann Kantschuster
who escorted him on a walk outside of the fenced part
of the camp prescribed to him by the camp doctor.</p>

<p>“Kantschuster gives the following report: He himself had
to urinate; Strauss proceeded on his way. Suddenly Strauss
broke away towards the shrub located at a distance of about
6 m from the line. When he noticed it, he fired 2 shots at the
fugitive from a distance of about 8 m, whereupon Strauss
collapsed dead.</p>

<p>“On the same day, May 24, 1933, a judicial inspection of the
locality took place. The corpse of Strauss was lying at the
edge of the wood. Leather slippers were on his feet. He
wore a sock on one foot, while the other foot was bare,
obviously because of an injury to this foot. Subsequently
an autopsy was performed. Two bullets had entered the
back of his head. Besides, the body showed several black
and blue spots (<span class='it'>Blutunterlaufung</span>) and also open wounds.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p><span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span>
“I have charged Kantschuster today with murder and have
made application for opening and execution of the judicial
preliminary investigation as well as for a warrant of arrest
against him.” (<span class='it'>641-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The second (<span class='it'>642-PS</span>) also 1 June 1933, relates to the death of
Leonhard Hausmann, another prisoner in Dachau. That letter
states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“On 17 May 1933, Leonhard Hausmann from Augsburg, 31
years old, married, relief worker, who was kept in protective
custody in the Dachau concentration camp, was shot by SS
Staff Sergeant Karl Ehmann. According to the account of
the latter, Hausmann was to dig out young fir trees in the
woods in the vicinity of the camp and pile them up on a certain
spot. He was supervised by Ehmann. Suddenly the latter
did not see him anymore. Therefore Ehmann looked after
the prisoners and saw him running away in a stooped position,
Ehmann ran after him, called ‘Halt’ several times, once also
‘Stop,’ but in vain. Whereupon Ehmann raised his pistol at
the prisoner and fired without aiming; Hausmann dropped
dead. Ehmann asserts that he fired from a distance of 10
to 12 meters.</p>

<p>“The corpse was inspected already on 17 May 1933 with the
assistance of the State court physician. It was found that
death was due to a shot through the left side of the chest.
According to the autopsy protocol, the shot was fired from a
distance less than 1 meter. Meanwhile the legal-medical
institute ascertained that the distance was less than 30
cm.” (<span class='it'>642-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The third (<span class='it'>644-PS</span>) 22 May 1933, relates to the death of Louis
Schloss, an inmate of Dachau. Attached to the letter is a copy
of a report of the autopsy conducted in the Schloss case, signed
by the examining physicians. The letter of 22 May 1933, begins:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“In the afternoon of 16 May 1933 the police station Dachau
informed the State Prosecution that an inmate of the concentration
camp Dachau, the merchant Louis Schloss, from
Nurnberg, widowed, born on 21 June 1889, has hanged himself
in solitary confinement. At the request of the state prosecution,
on the same day the legal inspection was performed
with the assistance of the state court physician with the
State Court Munich II. As it was proven that the corpse
exhibited numerous whip marks and as the cause of death
appeared doubtful, an autopsy was carried out on 17 May
1933. According to a preliminary certificate of the participating
<span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span>
physicians, the autopsy did not prove death by hanging”.
(<span class='it'>644-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>The preliminary opinion of the examining physician states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Preliminary opinion:</p>

<p>“I. The death through hanging could not be proven by
autopsy.</p>

<p>“II. Extensive blood suffusions and whipmarks were found,
particularly on the back, on the buttocks and on both arms,
as well as on both legs, abdomen and thorax to a minor
extent. In the region of the buttocks and shoulders extensive
destruction of adipose tissue was found together with the
blood suffusions. This is adequate to explain death through
autointoxication and fat embolism.” (<span class='it'>644-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The fourth (<span class='it'>645-PS</span>) 1 June 1933, relates to the death of
Sebastian Nefzger, another Dachau prisoner. The letter reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“On May 27, 1933, the following report was received by the
Lower Court Dachau:</p>

<p>“Concentration Camp Dachau, Political Division, May 27,
1933, to the Lower Court Dachau. An inquest on the dead
body of the prisoner Nefzger Sebastian merchant in Munich,
Schommerstrasse 17/0, born: 1/10/1900 in Munich, religion:
Catholic, marital status: married—showed that death through
the action of third persons must be excluded. Death was indubitably
caused by excessive bleeding resulting from an
opened artery of the left hand. Signed Dr. Nuernbergk,
Camp Physician.</p>

<p>“Neither the Lower Court Dachau nor the State Attorney
Munich II had up to that time been informed of Nefzger’s
death reported in the letter in spite of the fact that Nefzger
had already died in the night of the 25 to the 26th of May
1933. The Lower Court Dachau informed the State Attorney,
Munich II of this letter. A coroner’s inquest was ordered,
which took place as late as May 27, 1933. Since the physician
appointed by the Superior Court, doubted that death had
occurred to excessive bleeding and in identified marks of
strings on the victim’s neck, a judicial autopsy was arranged
by the State Attorney on May 29, 1933. The resulting opinion
of the expert is so far: I) The autopsy discloses that excessive
bleeding due to a cut on the left arm must be excluded
as a cause of death: II) The cut on the left wrist reveals
three incisions of the bone. Trial cuts are lacking. These
findings are contrary to the assumption that the wound has
been self-inflicted: III) It must be assumed that the cause
of death was suffocation. As a cause for suffocation, strangulation
<span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>
and throttling must be considered. The characteristics
of the marks left by the strings do not agree with those
otherwise observed in cases of death caused by hanging.”
(<span class='it'>645-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These four murders, committed within the short space of two
weeks in the Spring of 1933, each by different SS guards, are but
a few examples of SS activities in the camps even as early as 1933.
Many similar examples from that period and later periods could
be produced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indeed, that sort of thing was officially encouraged. Disciplinary
Regulations for the Dachau Concentration Camp were issued on
1 October 1933 by SS Fuehrer Eicke, who later became commander
of all the Death Head Units (<span class='it'>778-PS</span>). The fourth paragraph of
the introduction of those rules provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Tolerance means weakness. In the light of this conception,
punishment will be mercilessly handed out whenever the
interests of the Fatherland warrant it. The fellow countryman
who is decent but misled will never be affected by these
regulations. But let it be a warning to the agitating politicians
and intellectual provocators—regardless of which
kind—; be on guard not to be caught, for otherwise it will
be your neck and you will be shut up according to your own
methods.” (<span class='it'>778-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>So many inmates were killed “while trying to escape,” to use the
pat official phrase, that by 1936 the Minister of Justice was moved
to appeal to Himmler to regulate the use of firearms by the Death
Head Units. A memorandum 9 March 1936, prepared by Minister
of Justice Guertner, reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“On the 2d of this month, using the Hoppe case as an illustration,
I discussed the question of use of arms by the guard-personnel
of the concentration camp with the Reichsfuehrer
SS. I suggested to Himmler that he issue an order on the
use of arms for the officials subordinated to him. I referred
in this respect to the example of the decree on the use of arms
by the armed forces of 17 January of this year. Himmler
has promised me that such a decree will be issued and will
grant us participation in the preliminary work.” (<span class='it'>781-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The memorandum bears the pencil notation, “Initiative with
Himmler”. Subsequent events showed how Himmler carried out
this initiative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) <span class='it'>Administration of concentration camps through SS
agencies.</span> Furnishing guard personnel was not the only function
of the SS with relation to the camps. The entire internal management
of the camps, including the use of prisoners, their housing,
<span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>
clothing, sanitary conditions, the determination of their right
to live and the disposal of their remains, was controlled by the SS.
Such management was first vested in the leader of the SS Death
Head Units, who also had the title of Inspector of the Concentration
Camps. This official was originally a part of the SS Main
Office (<span class='it'>SS Hauptamt</span>), represented on the chart by the second
box from the left (<span class='it'>Chart Number 3</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the course of the war, in March 1942, control of concentration
camps was transferred to another of the departments
of the SS Supreme Command, the SS Economic and Administration
Main Office (commonly known as WVHA). That department
is indicated on the chart by the third box from the left (<span class='it'>Chart
Number 3</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>That change was announced in a letter to Himmler 30 April
1942 from SS Obergruppenfuehrer and General of the Waffen SS
Pohl, the Chief of WVHA (<span class='it'>R-129</span>). In that letter Pohl reported
on the measures he had taken to carry out Himmler’s order of
3 March 1942 to transform the camps into large scale economic
enterprises, and inclosed an order to all concentration camp
commanders which provided that no longer was there to be any
limit on working hours in the camps. (<span class='it'>R-129</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) <span class='it'>SS control of concentration camps and the slave labor
program.</span> This shift of control to WVHA coincided with the
change in the basic purposes of the concentration camps. Political
and security reasons, which previously had been the grounds for
confinement, were abandoned and the camps were made to serve
the Nazi slave labor program.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To satisfy the increased demands for manpower it was not
enough to work the inmates of the camp harder. More inmates
had to be obtained. Through its police arm, the SS was prepared
to satisfy this demand. On 17 December 1942 an order was issued
to all commanders of the Security Police and SD directing that
at least 35,000 prisoners qualified for work be sent immediately
to the concentration camps (<span class='it'>1063-D-PS</span>). Thirty-five thousand
prisoners was, of course, merely the beginning. The
SS dragnet was capable of catching many more slaves. A
directive to all the departments of the SS Supreme Command
signed by Himmler at his field headquarters on 5 August
1943, ordered the collection of men, women, and children for work
in coal mines (<span class='it'>744-PS</span>). This directive implements an order
signed by Keitel directing the use of all males captured in guerilla
fighting in the East for forced labor (<span class='it'>744-PS</span>). The Himmler
directive, it will be noted, is addressed to every main office in the
SS Supreme Command:

<p>“To figure 4 of the above-mentioned order, I order, that all

Sauckel.</p>

<p>“Children, old women, and men are to be collected and employed
in the women’s and children’s camps, established by
me, on estates as well as on the border of the evacuated
area.” (<span class='it'>744-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>In April 1944 the SS was called on to produce even more laborers,
this time 100,000 to be drawn from Hungarian Jews, as shown
by the minutes of Speer’s discussion with Himmler on 6 and 7
April 1944. (<span class='it'>R-124</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last source of manpower had not been tapped. To Jews,
deportees, women and children, there was added the productive
power of prisoners of war. Naturally enough it was through the
SS that the conspirators squeezed the last drop of labor from
such prisoners. Speer’s minutes of his conference with the
Fuehrer on 5 March 1944, state:
<span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Told the Fuehrer of the Reichs Marshal’s wish for further
utilization of the production power of prisoners of war by
giving the direction of the Stalag to the SS with the exception
of the English and Americans. The Fuehrer considers the
proposal good and has asked Colonel von Below to arrange
matters accordingly.” (<span class='it'>R-124</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>That matters were soon arranged is shown by Speer’s statement
made at the 58th discussion of the Central Planning Board
on 25 May 1944 (<span class='it'>R-124</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Speer: We have come to an arrangement with the Reichsfuehrer
SS as soon as possible so that PW’s he picks up are
made available for our purposes. The Reichsfuehrer SS gets
from 30 to 40 thousand men per month.” (<span class='it'>R-124</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Finally, in order to insure SS control over the labor of prisoners
of war, the Reichsfuehrer SS was appointed by Hitler as head
of all prisoner of war camps on 25 September 1944. A circular
letter from the Director of the Party Chancellery, 30 September
1944 and signed by M. Bormann, states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“1. The Fuehrer has ordered under the date 25 Sept 1944:

<p class='pindent'>So impressive were the results obtained from SS concentration
camp labor that Goering on 14 February 1944 called on Himmler
for more inmates for use in the aircraft industry (<span class='it'>1584-I-PS</span>).
Himmler’s reply to that request reads, in part, as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Most Honored Reichsmarshal:</p>

<p>“Following my teletype letter of the 18 Feb. 44 I herewith
<span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span>
transmit a survey on the employment of prisoners in the
aviation industry.</p>

<p>“This survey indicates that at the present time about <span class='it'>36,000
prisoners</span> are employed for the purposes of the air force.
An increase to a total of <span class='it'>90,000 prisoners is</span> contemplated.</p>

<p>“The production is being discussed, established, and executed
between the Reich Ministry of aviation and the chief of my
economic-administrative main office, SS-Obergruppenfuehrer
and General of the Waffen-SS, Pohl respectively.</p>

<p>“We assist with all forces at our disposal.</p>

<p>“The task of my economic-administrative main office, however,
is not solely fulfilled with the delivery of the prisoners
to the aviation industry as SS-Obergruppenfuehrer Pohl and
his assistants take care of the required working speed thru
constant and supervision of the work-groups [Kommandos]
and therefore have some influence on the results of production.
In this respect I may suggest consideration of the fact
that in enlarging our responsibility thru a speeding up of
the total work, better results can definitely be expected.</p>

<p>“We also have for some time adjusted our own stone-quarries
to production for the airforce. For instance in Flossenbuerg
near Weiden the prisoners employed previously in the quarry
are working now in the fighter plane program for the Messerschmitt
corporation Regensburg, which saw in the availability
of our stone-mason shops and labor forces after the
attack on Regensburg at that time a favorable opportunity
for the immediate partial transfer of their production. Altogether
4,000 prisoners will work there after the expansion.
We produce now with 2,000 men 900 sets of engine cowlings
and radiator covers as well as 120,000 single parts of various
kinds for the fighter ME 109.</p>

<p>“In Oranienburg we are employing 6,000 prisoners at the
Heinkel works now for construction of the HE 177. With
that we have supplied 60% of the total crew of the plant.”</p>

<p>“The movement of manufacturing plants of the aviation
industry to subterranean locations requires <span class='it'>further</span> employment
of about 100,000 prisoners. The plans for this employment
on the basis of your letter of 14 Feb. 1944 are already
under way.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>d</span>) <span class='it'>SS control of concentration camps and the ill treatment
and murder of inmates.</span> The intensive drive for manpower to
some extent interfered with the program already undertaken by
WVHA to exterminate certain classes of individuals in the camps.
This is shown by a letter from WVHA, Department D Concentration
Camps, 28 March 1942, addressed to a number of concentration
<span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span>
camp commandants and signed Liebehenschel, SS Obersturmbannfuehrer:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“It became known through a report of a Camp Commandant
that 42 prisoners out of 51 which were mustered out for the
special treatment 14 f 13 again became capable of work after a
period of time and therefore do not have to be directed to
the special treatment. From this it appears that the selection
of the prisoners is not being handled according to given
directives. Only those prisoners are allowed to be directed
to the examination commission who fulfill the given stipulations
and who above all are no longer capable of work.</p>

<p>“In order to be able to fulfill the designated missions of the
concentration camps, the working capabilities of every prisoner
must be retained for the camp. The camp commandants
of the concentration camps are requested to especially make
this their aim.” (<span class='it'>1151-P-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Another letter from WVHA, Department D Concentration Camps,
27 April 1943, addressed to a number of concentration camp commanders,
signed by Gluecks, SS Brigade Fuehrer and Major
General of the Waffen SS, deals with the same point:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Reich Fuehrer-SS and Chief of German Police has
decided, after consultation, that in the future only mentally
sick (<span class='it'>geisteskranke</span>) prisoners may be selected for action
14 F 13 by the medical commissions appointed for this
purpose.</p>

<p>“All other prisoners incapable of working (tubercular cases,
bedridden cripples, etc.) are to be basically excepted from
this action. Bedridden prisoners are to be drafted for suitable
work which they can perform in bed.</p>

<p>“The order of the Reich Fuehrer SS is to be obeyed strictly
in the future.</p>

<p>“Requests for fuel for this purpose, therefore, do not take
place.” (<span class='it'>1933-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The SS, however, was to some degree enabled to achieve both
goals—that of increased production and of elimination of undesirable
individuals, as shown by the agreement between Minister
of Justice Thierack and Himmler on 18 September 1942 (<span class='it'>654-PS</span>).
That agreement provided for the delivery of antisocial elements
after the execution of their sentences to the Reichsfuehrer SS
“to be worked to death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conditions under which such persons worked in the camps
were well calculated to lead to their deaths. Those conditions
were regulated by the WVHA. An illustration of WVHA management
is to be found in an order directed to commandants of
<span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span>
concentration camps, 11 August 1942, and issued by SS Brigade
Fuehrer and General of the Waffen SS Gluecks, Chief of Office
Group D of WVHA (<span class='it'>2189-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Reichsfuehrer SS and Chief of the German Police has
ordered, that punishment by beating will be executed in
concentration camps for women by <span class='it'>prisoners</span>—under the
ordered supervision.</p>

<p>“In order to coordinate this order the main office chief of the
main SS economic administration office, SS-Obergruppenfuehrer
and General of the Waffen-SS Pohl, has ordered,
effective immediately, that punishment by beating will also
be executed by prisoners in concentration camps for men.”
(<span class='it'>2189-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Even after their deaths, the prisoners did not escape the
management of WVHA. A directive to the commanders of concentration
camps, 12 September 1942, signed by the Chief of the
Central Office of Office Group D of WVHA, SS Obersturmbannfuehrer
Liebehenschel, provided:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“According to a communication of the Chief of the Security
Police and the SD and conforming to a report of the Chief
of Security Police and SD in Prague, urns of deceased Czechs
and Jews were sent for burial to the home-cemeteries within
the Protectorate.</p>

<p>“Based on different events (Demonstrations, erecting of
posters inimical to the Reich on urns of deceased inmates in
halls of cemeteries in the home-communities, pilgrimages to
the graves of deceased inmates, etc.) within the Protectorate,
the delivery of urns with the ash remnants of deceased
Nationals of the Protectorate and of Jews is henceforth prohibited.
The urns shall be preserved within the Concentration
Camps. In case of doubt about the preservation of the urns
oral instructions shall be available at this agency.” (<span class='it'>2199-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>e</span>) <span class='it'>SS use of concentration camp labor for pecuniary profit.</span>
The SS regarded the inmates of concentration camps as its own
personal property to be used for its own economic advantage.
The suggestion in Himmler’s letter to Goering, will be recalled,
that the SS be given a larger responsibility in the armament program
conducted in the camps (<span class='it'>1584-III-PS</span>). As early as 1942
Speer recognized that the SS was motivated by the desire for
further profits when he suggested to Hitler in a conference on
20, 21, and 22 September that the SS receive a share of the war
equipment produced by concentration camp labor in ratio to the
working hours of the prisoners (<span class='it'>R-124</span>). The Fuehrer agreed
that a 3 to 5 percent share would satisfy SS commanders (<span class='it'>R-124</span>).
<span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span>
Himmler himself frankly admitted his intention to derive profits
for SS purposes from the camps in his speech to the officers of
the SS Leibstandarte “Adolf Hitler” (<span class='it'>1918-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * The apartment-building program which is the prerequisite
for a healthy and social basis of the entire SS as
well as of the entire Fuehrerkorps can be carried out only
when I get the money for it from somewhere; nobody is going
to give me the money, it must be earned, and it will be earned
by forcing the scum of mankind, the prisoners, the professional
criminals to do positive work. The man, guarding
these prisoners, serves just as hard as the one on close-order
drill. The one who does this and stands near these utterly
negative people will learn within 3 to 4 months * * *
and we shall see: In peacetime I shall form guard-battalions
and put them on duty for 3 months only—to fight the inferior
being (<span class='it'>Untermenschentum</span>), and this will not be a boring
guard duty, but if the officers handle it right, it will be the
best indoctrination on inferior beings and the inferior races.
This activity is necessary, as I said; 1. to eliminate those
negative people from the German people; 2. to exploit them
once more for the great folk community by having them
break stones and bake bricks so that the Fuehrer can again
erect his grand buildings; and 3. to in turn invest the money,
earned soberly this way, in houses, in ground, in settlements
so that our men can have houses in which to raise large
families and lots of children. This in turn is necessary because
we stand or die with this leading blood of Germany
and if the good blood is not reproduced we will not be able
to rule the world.” (<span class='it'>1918-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>Functions and activities with respect to human experiments.</span>
One aspect of SS control over concentration camps remains
to be mentioned—its direction of the program of biological experiments
on human beings which was carried on in the camps. An
American military tribunal has passed judgment on some of the
SS members who participated in these experiments at Dachau.
The purpose of this discussion is to show only that those experiments
were the result of SS direction and that the SS played a
vital part in their successful execution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The program seems to have originated in a request by Dr.
Sigmund Rascher to Himmler for permission to utilize persons
in concentration camps as material for experiments with human
beings, in connection with research he was conducting on behalf
of the Luftwaffe. A letter dated 15 May 1941, addressed to the
<span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span>
Reichsfuehrer SS and signed by S. Rascher reads in part as
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“For the time being I have been assigned to the <span class='it'>Luftgaukommando</span>
VLL, Munich for a medical course. During this course,
where researches on high-altitude flights play a prominent
part (determined by the somewhat higher ceiling of the
English fighter planes) considerable regret was expressed at
the fact that no tests with human material had yet been
possible for us, as such experiments are very dangerous and
nobody volunteers for them. I put, therefore, the serious
question: can you make available two or three professional
criminals for these experiments? The experiments are made
at <span class='it'>Bodenstaendige Bruefstells fuer Hoehenforschung der
Luftwaffe</span>, Munich. The experiments, by which the subjects
can, of course, die, would take place with my cooperation.
They are essential for researches on high-altitude flight and
cannot be carried out, as has been tried, with monkeys, who
offer entirely different test-conditions. I have had a very
confidential talk with a representative of the air forces
surgeon who makes these experiments. He is also of the
opinion that the problem in question could only be solved
by experiments on human persons. (Feeble-minded could
also be used as that material.)” (<span class='it'>1602-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Dr. Rascher promptly received assurance that he would be allowed
to utilize concentration camp inmates for his experiments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A letter dated 22 May 1941, addressed to Dr. Rascher and
bearing the signature of SS Sturmbannfuehrer Karl Brandt,
reads in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Shortly before flying to Oslo, the Reichsfuehrer SS gave
me your letter of 15 May 1941, for partial reply.</p>

<p>“I can inform you that prisoners will of course be gladly
made available for the high-flight researches. I have informed
the Chief of the Security Police of this agreement of the
Reichsfuehrer SS, and requested that the competent official
be instructed to get in touch with you.” (<span class='it'>1582-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The altitude experiments were conducted by Rascher. In May
1942 General Field Marshal Milch on behalf of the Luftwaffe
expressed his thanks to the SS for the assistance it furnished in
connection with the experiments. This letter, dated 20 May 1942,
addressed to SS Obergruppenfuehrer Wolff reads in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“In reference to your telegram of 12 May our sanitary inspector
reports to me that the altitude experiments carried
out by the SS and Air Force at Dachau have been finished.
Any continuation of these experiments seems essentially unreasonable.
<span class='pageno' title='215' id='Page_215'></span>
However the carrying out of experiments of
some other kind, in regard to perils at high seas, would be
important. These have been prepared in immediate agreement
with the proper offices; Major (M.C.) Weltz will be
charged with the execution and Capt. (M.C.) Rascher will
be made available until further orders in addition to his
duties within the Medical Corps of the Air Corps. A change
of these measures does not appear necessary, and an enlargement
of the task is not considered pressing at this time.</p>

<p>“The low-pressure chamber would not be needed for these
low-temperature experiments. It is urgently needed at another
place and therefore can no longer remain in Dachau.</p>

<p>“I convey the special thanks from the supreme commander
of the Air Corps to the SS for their extensive cooperation.</p>

<p>“I remain with best wishes for you in good comradeship and

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Having finished his high-altitude experiments, Dr. Rascher
proceeded to experiment with methods of rewarming persons who
had been subjected to extreme cold. On 10 September 1942 he
rendered an intermediate report on intense chilling experiments
which had been started in Dachau on 15 August (<span class='it'>1618-PS</span>).
That report states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The experimental subjects (VP) were placed in the water,
dressed in complete flying uniform, winter or summer combination,
and with an aviator’s helmet. A life jacket made
of rubber or kapok was to prevent submerging. The experiments
were carried out at water temperatures varying from
2.5° to 12°.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“Electrical measurements gave low temperature readings of
26.4° in the stomach and 26.5° in the rectum. Fatalities occurred
only when the brain stem and the back of the head
were also chilled. Autopsies of such fatal cases always
revealed large amounts of free blood, up to ½ liter, in the
cranial cavity. The heart invariably showed extreme dilation
of the right chamber. As soon as the temperature in these
experiments reached 28°, the experimental subjects (VP)
died invariably, despite all attempts at resuscitation.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“During attempts to save severely chilled persons (<span class='it'>Unterkuehlte</span>),
it was shown that rapid rewarming was in all cases
<span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span>
preferable to slow rewarming, because after removal from
the cold water, the body temperature continued to sink
rapidly. I think that for this reason we can dispense with
the attempt to save intensely chilled subjects by means of
animal heat.</p>

<p>“Rewarming by animal warmth—animal bodies or women’s
bodies—would be too slow.” (<span class='it'>1618-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Although Rascher was of the preliminary opinion that rewarming
by women’s bodies would be too slow, means for conducting
such experiments were nevertheless placed at his disposal. A
letter from the Reichsfuehrer SS, signed Himmler, 16 November
1942, and addressed to Lt. General Pohl, the head of WVHA, read
as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The following struck me during my visit to Dachau on the
13 Nov 1942 regarding the experiments conducted there for
the saving of people whose lives are endangered through
exposure (<span class='it'>Unterkuehlung</span>) in ice, snow, or water and who are
to be saved by the employment of every method or means:</p>

<p>“I had ordered that suitable women are to be set aside from
the Concentration Camp for these experiments for the warming
of these who were exposed. Four girls were set aside
who were in the Concentration Camp due to loose living, and
being prostitutes, they formulate a danger of contagion.
* * *” (<span class='it'>1583-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>To insure the continuance of Rascher’s experiments, Himmler
arranged for his transfer to the Waffen SS. A letter dated November
1942 from the Reichsfuehrer SS addressed to “Dear Comrade
Milch,” stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“You will recall that through General Wolff I particularly
recommended to you for your consideration the work of a
certain SS Fuehrer, Dr. Rascher, who is a physician of the
air force on leave (<span class='it'>Arzt des Beurlaubtenstandes der Luftwaffe</span>).</p>

<p>“These researches which deal with the behavior of the human
organism at great heights, as well as with manifestations
caused by prolonged cooling of the human body in cold water,
and similar problems which are of vital importance to the
air force in particular, can be performed by us with particular
efficiency because I personally assumed the responsibility
for supplying asocial individuals and criminals who deserve
only to die (<span class='it'>todeswuerdig</span>) from concentration camps for
these experiments.”</p>

<p>“I beg you to release Dr. Rascher, Stabsarzt in reserve, from
<span class='pageno' title='217' id='Page_217'></span>
the air force and to transfer him to me to the Waffen-SS. I
would then assume the sole responsibility for having these
experiments made in this field, and would put the results, of
which we in the SS need only a part for the frost injuries
in the East, entirely at the disposal of the air force. However,
in this connection I suggest that with the liaison between
you and Wolff a “non-Christian” physician should be
charged, who should be at the same time honorable as a
scientist and not prone to intellectual theft and who could be
informed of the results. This physician should also have
good contacts with the adminstrative[administrative?] authorities, so that
the results would really obtain a hearing.</p>

<p>“I believe that this solution—to transfer Dr. Rascher to
the SS, so that he could carry out the experiments under my
responsibility and under my orders—is the best way. The
experiments should not be stopped; we owe that to our men.
If Dr. Rascher remained with the air force, there would certainly
be much annoyance; because then I would have to
bring a series of unpleasant details to you, because of the
arrogance and assumption which Professor Dr. Holzloehner
has displayed in the post of Dachau—who is under my command—about
me in utterances delivered to SS Colonel Sievers.
In order to save both of us this trouble, I suggest again
that Dr. Rascher should be transferred to the Waffen SS as
quickly as possible.” (<span class='it'>1617-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Rascher’s experiments were by no means the only experiments
in which the SS was interested. Without attempting even to outline
the whole extent of the experimental program, one further
illustration of this type of SS activity may be mentioned. That is
a report prepared by the Chief Hygienist in the office of the Reich
Surgeon of the SS and Police, SS Oberfuehrer Dr. Mrugowsky,
12 September 1944, relating to experiments with poisoned bullets.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“On 11 September 1944, in the presence of SS-Sturmbannfuehrer
Dr. Ding, Dr. Widman and the undersigned, experiments
with Akonotinnitrate bullets were carried out on five
persons who had been sentenced to death. The caliber of the
bullets used was 7.65 cm and they were filled with the poison
in crystal form. Each subject of the experiments received
one shot in the upper part of the left thigh, while in a horizontal
position. In the case of 2 persons, the bullets passed
clean through the upper part of the thigh. Even later no
effect from the poison could be seen. These two subjects were
therefore rejected * * *.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p><span class='pageno' title='218' id='Page_218'></span>
“The symptoms shown by the three condemned persons were
surprisingly the same. At first, nothing special was noticeable.
After 20 to 25 minutes, a disturbance of the motor
nerves and a light flow of saliva began, but both stopped
again. After 40 to 44 minutes a strong flow of saliva appeared.
The poisoned persons swallowed frequently, later
the flow of saliva is so strong that it can no longer be controlled
by swallowing. Foamy saliva flows from the mouth.
Then, a sensation of choking, and vomiting start.” (<span class='it'>L-103</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>The next three paragraphs describe in coldly scientific fashion
the reactions of the dying persons. That description then concludes:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“At the same time there was pronounced nausea. One of
the poisoned persons tried in vain to vomit. In order to succeed
he put 4 fingers of his hand, up to the main joint, right
into his mouth. In spite of this, no vomiting occurred. His
face became quite red.</p>

<p>“The faces of the other two subjects were already pale at an
early stage. Other symptoms were the same. Later on the disturbance
of the motor nerves increased so much that the persons
threw themselves up and down rolled their eyes and
made aimless movements with their hands and arms. At
last, the disturbance subsided, the pupils were enlarged to
the maximum, the condemned lay still. Massetercramp and
loss of urine was observed in one of them. Death occurred
121, and 129 minutes after they were shot.” (<span class='it'>L-103</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The fact that SS doctors engaged in such experiments was no
accident. It was consistent with an ideology and racial philosophy
which, to use Himmler’s own words, regarded human beings as
lice and offal. But the most important factor was the fact that
only the SS was in a position to supply necessary human material.
And it did supply such material through WVHA. A letter from
the Department Chief of Office Group D of WVHA, 12 May 1944,
addressed to the commandants of all concentration camps dealt
with the assignment of prisoners for the experimental purposes:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“There is cause to call attention to the fact that in every
case permission for assignment has to be requested here <span class='it'>before</span>
assignment of prisoners is made for experimental purposes.</p>

<p>“To be included in this request are number, kind of custody,
and in case of aryan prisoners, exact personal data,
file number in the Main Reich’s Security Office and reason for
detainment into the concentration camp.
<span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span></p>

<p>“Herewith, I explicitly forbid assignment of prisoners for
experimental purposes without permission.” (<span class='it'>1751-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It was on the basis of its ability to supply such material that
the Ministry of Finance was prepared to subsidize the SS experimental
program. This matter was discussed in a series of letters
between the Ministry of Finance, the Reichs Research Department,
and the Reich Surgeon of the SS and police (<span class='it'>002-PS</span>).
The first is from the office of the Executive Council of the Reichs
Research Department, addressed to the Reichs Surgeon SS and
Police, 19 February 1943, and signed by Mentzel, Chief of Bureau,
SS Brigade Leader:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Reichs Minister of Finance told me that you requested
53 leading positions (BES. GR C3-C8) for your
office, partly for a new research institute.</p>

<p>“After the Reichsmarschall of the Great German Reich
had, as President of the Reichs Research Dept., entrusted
himself with all German research, issued directives among
other things, that in the execution of military important scientific
tasks, the available institutions including equipment
and personnel should be utilized to the utmost for reasons of
necessary economization (of effort).</p>

<p>“The foundation of new institutes comes therefore only in
question in as far as there are no outstanding institutes available
for the furtherance of important war research tasks.”
(<span class='it'>002-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>To this letter the Reich Surgeon of SS and Police replied on 26
February 1943:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“In acknowledgment of your correspondence of the 19th
Feb. 1943, I am able to reply the following to it today:</p>

<p>“The appropriation for the 53 key positions for my office
which you made the basis of your memorandum was a veritable
peace plan.</p>

<p>“The special institutes of the SS which are to be partly
staffed through this appropriation are to serve the purpose
to establish and make accessible for the entire realm of scientific
research, the particular possibilities of research only
possessed by the SS.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“I will gladly be at your disposal at any time to discuss the
particular research aims in connection with the SS, which I
would like to bring up upon the direction of the Reichs Director
SS.” (<span class='it'>002-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>An interview between the Reich Surgeon and Mentzel took
<span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span>
place, and on 25 March 1943 Mentzel wrote the following letter
to the Reich Minister of Finance:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“In regard to your correspondence of the 19th Dec (J 4761—174
I g III. Ang) to which I gave you a preliminary communication
on the 19th Feb, I finally take the following position:</p>

<p>“The Surgeon General-SS and Police, in a personal discussion,
told me that the budget claim which he looks after is
used primarily in the pure military sector of the Waffen SS.
Since it is established on a smaller scale for the enlarging of
scientific research possibilities, they pertain therefore exclusively
to such affairs that are carried out with the material
(Prisoners—‘<span class='it'>Haflinge</span>’) which is only accessible to the Waffen
SS and are therefore not to be undertaken for any other
experimental purposes.</p>

<p>“I cannot object therefore on the part of the Reichs Experimental
Counsel against the budget claims of the Surgeon
General, SS and Police.” (<span class='it'>002-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(5) <span class='it'>Functions and Activities with respect to Jewish Persecution.</span>
Through its activities with respect to concentration camps
the SS performed part of its mission to safeguard the security of
the Nazi regime. But another specialized aspect of that mission
must not be forgotten. Himmler had defined that task as the
prevention of a “<span class='it'>Jewish</span> Bolshevist revolution of subhumans.” In
plain words this meant participation in the Nazi program of
Jewish persecution and extermination. That program involved
every branch and component of the SS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The racial philosophy of the SS made that organization a natural
agency for the execution of all types of anti-semitic measures.
The SS position on the Jewish question was publicly stated in the
SS newspaper “<span class='it'>Das Schwarze Korps</span>,” in the issue of 8 August
1940, by its editor, Gunter d’Alquen (<span class='it'>2668-PS</span>). “<span class='it'>Das Schwarze
Korps</span>” was the official propaganda agency of the SS which every
SS man was required to read and to induce others to read. This
was the SS position on the Jews:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Just as the Jewish question will be solved for Germany
only when the last Jew has been deported, so the rest of
Europe should realize that the German peace which awaits
it must be a peace without Jews.” (<span class='it'>2668-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The attempted “solution” of the Jewish question through pogroms
and “spontaneous” demonstrations occurred following the
murder of von Rath in November 1938. In these demonstrations
all branches of the SS were called on to play a part. The teletype
message from SS Gruppenfuehrer Heydrich, Chief of the Security
<span class='pageno' title='221' id='Page_221'></span>
Police and SD, issued on 10 November 1938 concerning “Measures
against Jews tonight,” provided:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * The direction of the measures of the Security
Police concerning the demonstrations against Jews is vested
with the organs of the State Police—inasmuch as the inspectors
of the Security Police are not issuing their own orders.
In order to carry out the measures of the Security Police,
officials of the Criminal Police, as well as members of the
SD, of the <span class='it'>Verfuegungstruppe</span> and the <span class='it'>Allgemeine SS</span> may
be used.” (<span class='it'>3051-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>With the outbreak of the war and the march of Nazi armies
over the Continent, the SS participated in “solving” the Jewish
question in all the countries of Europe. The solution was nothing
short of extermination. To a large degree these wholesale murders
were disguised under the name of “anti-partisan” or “anti-guerilla”
actions, and as such included as victims not merely
Jews but Soviets, Poles, and other Eastern peoples. One example
of an action confined essentially to Jews was the mass annihilation
of Jews in gas vans (<span class='it'>501-PS</span>). Those vans were operated by
the Security Police and SD under the direction of RSHA. Another
example is found in the report entitled “Solution of the Jewish
Question in Galicia,” prepared by SS Gruppenfuehrer and Lt.
General of the Police Katzman and rendered to SS Obergruppenfuehrer
and General of the Police Krueger (<span class='it'>L-18</span>). The “solution,”
which consisted in evacuation and extermination of all the
Jews in Galicia and confiscation of their property, was carried out
under the energetic direction of the SS and Police Leaders, with
the assistance of SS police units, as the report proudly boasts.
Three additional items in that report dealing specifically with the
SS should be noted. The first is the text under a photograph in
the original report:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Great was the joy of the SS men when the Reichsfuehrer
SS in person in 1942 visited some camps along the Rollbahn.”
(<span class='it'>L-18</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>The second is a balance sheet, showing the income from forced
Jewish labor and expenditures therefrom. Item 3 on the balance
sheet reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<table id='tab19' summary='' class='center'>

<p>Further payments to the SS-cashier are effected every
month.” (<span class='it'>L-18</span>)</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pageno' title='222' id='Page_222'></span></p>

<p>The third is the last two paragraphs of the report:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Despite the extraordinary burden heaped upon every single
SS Police Officer during these actions, mood and spirit of the
men were extraordinarily good and praiseworthy to the last
day.</p>

<p>“Only thanks to the sense of duty of every single leader and
man have we succeeded to get rid of this PLAGUE in so short
a time.” (<span class='it'>L-18</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>One final example of SS participation in Jewish extermination is
the report by SS Brigadefuehrer and Major General of the Police,
Stroop, of the destruction of the Jewish Ghetto in Warsaw during
April and May 1943 (<span class='it'>1061-PS</span>). Two sections of that report dealing
with the constitution of the participating forces should be
noted. A table of the units used indicates the average number of
officers and men from each unit employed per day. It will be observed
that among the units involved were the staff of the SS and
Police Leader, two battalions of the Waffen SS, two battalions of
the 22d SS Police Regiment and members of the Security Police.
The part played by the Waffen SS particularly came in for high
praise from the writer of the report. Tribute is paid to the toughness
of the men of the Waffen SS, Police, and <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>. In the
next paragraph the writer says:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Considering that the greater part of the men of the Waffen
SS had been trained for only three or four weeks before being
assigned to this action, high credit should be given for the
pluck, courage and devotion to duty which they showed.”
(<span class='it'>1061-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>The selection methods and ideological education of Waffen SS men
furnished such good grounding that a few weeks of practice was
all that was required to turn them into excellent exterminators.
Himmler’s proud boast of the part that the SS played in the extermination
of the Jews occurs in his Posen Speech:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Most of <span class='it'>you</span> must know what it means when 100 corpses are
lying side by side, or 500 or 1,000. To have stuck it out and at
the same time—apart from the exceptions caused by human
weakness—to have remained decent fellows, that is what has
made us hard. This is a page of glory in our history which
has never been written and is never to be written * * *.”
(<span class='it'>1919-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(6) <span class='it'>Functions and activities with respect to preparing for and
waging aggressive war.</span> From the very beginning the SS made
prime contributions to the conspirators’ aggressive aims. First, it
served as one of the para-military organizations under which the
<span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span>
conspirators disguised their building up of an Army in violation
of the Versailles Treaty. Second, through affiliated SS organizations
in other countries and through some of the departments in
its own Supreme Command, it fostered Fifth Column movements
outside Germany and prepared the way for aggression. Third,
through its militarized units, it participated in the aggressive actions
which were eventually carried out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) <span class='it'>The SS as a para-military organization.</span> The para-military
character of the General SS is apparent from the military character
of its structure, the military discipline required of its members,
and the steps it took to enlist in its ranks young men of military
age. In addition to this volunteer Army the SS created, as
early as 1933, fully armed professional soldiers who complied with
the requirement for compulsory military service by performing
duties in the SS. These were the <span class='it'>SS Vorfuegungstruppe</span> and the
Death Head Units.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) <span class='it'>The SS as a fifth column agency.</span> While building up the SS
as a military force within Germany, the conspirators also utilized
it in other countries to lay the groundwork for aggression. During
the seizure of Austria, the <span class='it'>SS Standarte 89</span> was directly involved
in the murder of Chancellor Dolfuss, and a memorial placque was
erected in Vienna as a tribute to the SS men who participated in
that murder (<span class='it'>L-273</span>; <span class='it'>2968-PS</span>). Subsequently, on the night of
11 March 1938, the SS with the SA marched into Vienna and
occupied all government buildings and important posts in the city.
(See the report of Gauleiter Rainer to Reich Commissioner Buerckel
(<span class='it'>812-PS</span>); and the record of the telephone conversations between
Goering and Dambrowski (<span class='it'>2949-PS</span>)).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same pattern was repeated in Czechoslovakia. Henlein’s
Free Corps played in that country the part of fifth column which
the SS had played in Austria and was rewarded, in September
1938, by being placed under the jurisdiction of the Reichsfuehrer
SS (<span class='it'>388-PS, Items 37, 38</span>). Moreover, a Most Secret OKW order
of 28 September 1938, reveals that the SS had its own armed units,
four battalions of <span class='it'>Totenkopf Verbaende</span>, actually operating in
Czechoslovakian territory before the Munich Pact was signed
(<span class='it'>388-PS, Item 36</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>But SS preparations for aggression were not confined to military
forces. One of the departments of the SS Supreme Command,
the <span class='it'>Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle</span>, was a center for fifth column activity.
At the secret meeting between Ribbentrop and Henlein in
March 1938, at which the line to be followed by the Sudeten German
Party was determined, the <span class='it'>Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle</span> was represented
by Professor Haushofer and SS Obergruppenfuehrer
<span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span>
Lorenz (<span class='it'>2788-PS</span>). And when the Foreign Office in August 1938
awarded further subsidies to Henlein’s Sudeten Party, the memorandum
of that recommendation (<span class='it'>3059-PS</span>) contained the significant
footnote:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Volksdeutsche Mittlestelle will be informed.” (<span class='it'>3059-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) <span class='it'>SS participation in aggressive war.</span> When at last the time
came to strike, the SS was ready. In the words of the National
Socialist Yearbook for 1940 (<span class='it'>2164-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“When the march into the liberated provinces of the Sudetenland
began on that memorable October 1, 1938, <span class='it'>Verfuegungstruppe</span>
as well as the Death Head Units were along with those
in the lead. * * *”</p>

<p>“The 15th of March 1939 brought a similar utilization of the
SS when it served to establish order in collapsing Czechoslovakia.
This action ended with the founding of the protectorate
Bohemia-Moravia.</p>

<p>“Only a week later, on the 29th of March 1939, Memel also
returned to the Reich upon basis of an agreement with Lithuania.
Again it was the SS, here above all the Eastern Prussian
SS, which played a prominent part in the liberation of
this province.” (<span class='it'>2164-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the final act which set off the war, the attack on Poland in
September 1939, the SS acted as stage manager. In his affidavit
(<span class='it'>Affidavit A</span>), Maj. Gen. Erwin Lahousen describes the simulated
attack on the radio station Gleiwitz by Germans dressed in Polish
uniforms, as one of the most mysterious actions which took place
in the <span class='it'>Abwehr</span> office:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“This was an incident which had been deliberately engineered
and directed by the SD and it was executed by prisoners from
Concentration Camps dressed up in Polish uniforms, and
using Polish weapons and equipment. Those prisoners were
later murdered by the SD in order to eliminate any possibility
of their giving testimony of the incident.” (<span class='it'>Affidavit A</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The war erupted and the Waffen SS again took its place in the
van of the attacking forces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(7) <span class='it'>Functions and activities with respect to commission of war
crimes.</span> During the war great use was made of the peculiar qualities
possessed by the SS—qualities not only of its combat force,
but of its other components as well—in executing tasks embracing
the commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) <span class='it'>“Antipartisan” operations.</span> A directive issued by Keitel on
13 March 1941, making preparations 3 months in advance for the
attack on Russia, provided that in the area of operations the
<span class='pageno' title='225' id='Page_225'></span>
Reichsfuehrer SS was entrusted with special tasks for the preparation
of the political administration—tasks which would result from
the struggle about to commence between two opposing political
systems. (<span class='it'>447-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the steps taken by the Reichsfuehrer SS to carry out
those “special tasks” was the formation and use of so-called “anti-partisan”
units. They were discussed by Himmler in his Posen
speech:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“In the meantime I have also set up the Chief of the anti-partisan
units. Our comrade SS Obergruppenfuehrer von
dem Bach is Chief of the anti-partisan units. I considered it
necessary for the Reichsfuehrer SS to be in authoritative
command in all these battles, for I am convinced that we are
best in position to take action against this enemy struggle,
which is decidedly a political one. Except where units which
had been supplied and which we had formed for this purpose
were taken from us to fill in gaps at the front, we have been
very successful.</p>

<p>“It is notable that by setting up this department, we have
gained for the SS in turn, a division, a corps, an army, and
the next step—which is the High Command of an army or
area of a group—if you wish to call it that.” (<span class='it'>1919-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>What the SS did with its division, corps, and army, out of which
the anti-partisan units were formed, is illustrated in the “Activity
and Situation Report No. 6 of the Task Forces of the Security
Police and SD in the U.S.S.R.,” covering the period from 1 to 31
October 1941 (<span class='it'>R-102</span>). The report shows that so-called “anti-partisan”
activity was actually nothing but a name for extermination
of Jews and persons believed politically undesirable. The
report is a carefully organized and detailed description of such
extermination. Section I describes the stations of the various
Task Forces involved, and section II their activities. The latter
section is divided into parts, each dealing with a different geographical
region—the Baltic area, White Ruthenia, and the
Ukraine. Under each area the report of activities is classified
under three headings: (<span class='it'>a</span>) Partisan activity and counteraction;
(<span class='it'>b</span>) arrests and executions of communists and officials; and (<span class='it'>c</span>)
Jews. The following units were involved (<span class='it'>R-102</span>):</p>

are active mainly in Lithouania, Latvia, Esthonia,
White-Ruthenia and to a smaller part in front of Leningrad.
It shows further that the forces of the uniformed police and
the Armed SS are active mainly in front of Leningrad, in
order to take measures against the returning population and
under their own officers. This is so much easier because the
Action detachments in Lithouania, Latvia and Esthonia have
at their disposal native police units, as described in encl. 1,
and because so far 150 Latvian reinforcements have been sent
to White-Ruthenia.</p>

during the individual phases can be gathered from encl. 2,
the advance and the activities of the Action-Group and the

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) <span class='it'>Murder of prisoners of war.</span> It is not surprising that units
of the Waffen SS, a branch which had thus been employed for
extermination actions and the execution of civilians, also violated
the laws of warfare when carrying on ordinary combat activities.
Proof of these violations is contained in a supplementary report
of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force Court
of Inquiry concerning the shooting of allied prisoners of war by
the 12th SS Panzer Division (Hitler Jugend) in Normandy,
France, on 7-21 June 1944 (<span class='it'>2997-PS</span>). The Court of Inquiry
concluded that there occurred in Normandy, between 7 and 17
June 1944, seven cases of violations of the law of war, involving
the shooting of 64 unarmed allied prisoners of war in uniform,
many of whom had been previously wounded, and none of whom
had resisted or endeavored to escape; that the perpetrators were
members of the 12th SS Panzer Division, the so-called Hitler
Jugend Division; that enlisted men of the 15th Company of the
25th Panzer Grenadier Regiment of that Division were given secret
orders to the effect that SS troops should take no prisoners and
that prisoners were to be executed after having been interrogated;
that similar orders were given to men of the 3d Battalion of the
26th SS Panzer Grenadier Regiment and to the 12th SS Engineering
and Reconnaissance Battalions; and that the conclusion was
irresistible that it was understood throughout the Division that a
policy of denying quarter or executing prisoners after interrogation
was openly approved. (<span class='it'>2997-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other combatants met a similar fate at the hands of other components
of the SS. (The execution of allied fliers, of commandos,
and paratroopers, and of escaped prisoners of war who were turned
over to the SD to be destroyed, is discussed in Section 6 on the
Gestapo.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Combatants who were taken prisoner of war encountered the
SS in another form. (Section 6 on the Gestapo discusses the selection,
by SS groups stationed in prisoner of war camps, of prisoners
for what the Nazis euphemistically called “special treatment.”)
Finally, the entire control of prisoners of war was turned over to
the Reichsfuehrer SS, pursuant to the circular letter from the
Nazi Party Chancellery placing Himmler in charge of all prisoner
of war camps. (<span class='it'>058-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(8) <span class='it'>Functions and activities with respect to Germanization of
conquered lands.</span> The final phase of the conspiracy in which the
SS played a leading role comprehended the colonization of conquered
territories, the destruction of their national existence, and
the permanent extension of the German frontier. These objectives
<span class='pageno' title='230' id='Page_230'></span>
were carried out through the forcible evacuation and resettlement
of inhabitants of conquered regions, confiscation of their properties,
“denationalization” and “reeducation” of persons of German
blood, and the colonization of conquered territories by Germans.
(See Chapter X on the Slave Labor Program and Chapter XIII
on Germanization and Spoliation.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The SS was the logical agency to formulate and carry out the
execution of this program. The numerous statements made by
Himmler as to SS training for its role as the aristocracy in the
“new Europe” leave that beyond doubt. Himmler immediately proceeded
to put these theories into practice upon his appointment
on 7 October 1939 as Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation
of German Folkdom. (<span class='it'>686-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>To make and carry out plans for the program of evacuation and
resettlement, a new department of the SS Supreme Command, the
Staff Headquarters of the Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation
of German Folkdom, was created. The functions of this office
are thus described in the Organizations Book of the NSDAP for
1943:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Main Office of the Staff of the Reichs Commissar for the
Consolidation of German Nationality is entrusted with the
whole settlement and constructive planning and with its execution
in the Reich and all those territories within the authority
of the Reich, including all administrative and economic
questions in connection with settlement, especially the deployment
of manpower for this purpose.” (<span class='it'>2640-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The colonization program had two principal objectives: the
first phase was the destruction of the conquered peoples, by exterminating
them, deporting them, and confiscating their property;
the second phase was the bringing back of racial Germans to settle
in the newly acquired land and to live from the wealth of those
who had been eliminated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) <span class='it'>Elimination and deportation of conquered people.</span> The extermination
actions contributed in part to clearing the conquered
territories of persons deemed dangerous to the Nazi plan. But
not every undesirable could be liquidated. Moreover, manpower
was needed for the Nazi war effort. Mass deportation thus accomplished
the twin purpose of providing labor and of freeing the
land for German colonists. The participation of SS agencies in
deporting persons from the conquered territories to meet the increased
demands of the Nazi war machine for manpower has
already been shown. The evacuation and resettlement program,
however, required the use of additional SS agencies to deport
persons occupying the desired living space. For this purpose immigration
<span class='pageno' title='231' id='Page_231'></span>
centers were set up under the direction of RSHA, as
is stated in the National Socialist Yearbook for 1941:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“For some time now the Reichsfuehrer-SS has had at his
disposal an office under the management of SS-Obergruppenfuehrer
Lorenz, the <span class='it'>Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle</span>. This office
has the task of dealing with National German questions and
the raising of required support.</p>

<p>“In addition to the VM the Immigration Center Offices with
the Chief of the Security Police and the Security Service of
the SS (under the management of SS-Obersturmbannfuehrer
Dr. Sandberger) and the Settlement Staff of the Reich-Commissioner
were created, which, in cooperation with the NSV
[National Socialist Welfare Organization] and the Reich
Railroad Agency, took charge of the Migration of National
Germans.” (<span class='it'>2163-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Further evidence is contained in the affidavit of Otto Hoffman,
SS Obergruppenfuehrer and General of the Waffen SS and Police,
who was chief in the Main Office for Race and Settlement in the
SS Supreme Command until 1943. This affidavit, taken at Freising,
Germany, on 4 August 1945 reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * 2. The executive power, in other words the carrying
out of all so-called resettlement actions, that is to say,
sending away of Polish and Jewish settlers and those of non-German
blood from a territory in Poland destined for Germanization,
was in the hands of the Chief of the RSHA (Heydrich
and later Kaltenbrunner, since the end of 1942). The Chief
of the RSHA also supervised and issued orders to the so-called
immigration center (EWZ) which classified the Germans,
living abroad who returned to Germany and directed
them to the individual farms, already freed. The latter was
done in agreement with the chief office of the Reichsfuehrer
SS.” (<span class='it'>L-49</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Other SS agencies also were included. The report, dated 22 May
1940, relating to confiscation of Polish agricultural enterprises
and deportation of the Polish owners to Germany, shows that the
following SS agencies were involved in this action:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Means of transportation to the railroad can be provided
(1)—by the enterprise of the East German Corporation of
Agricultural Development, (2)—by the SS NCO School in
Lublinitz and the concentration camp of Auschwitz.</p>

<p>“These two latter places will also detail the necessary SS men
for the day of the confiscation, etc.” (<span class='it'>1352-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The extent to which departments of the Supreme Command
of the SS were concerned with the evacuation program is shown
<span class='pageno' title='232' id='Page_232'></span>

greater Reich. Not all Germans were deemed reliable colonists,
however. Those who were not, were returned to Germany proper
for “re-Germanization” and “reeducation” along Nazi lines. A
typical instance of the fate of such Germans is found in the decree
of the Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German
Folkdom of 16 February 1942, dealing with the treatment to be
accorded so-called “Polonized” Germans (<span class='it'>R-112</span>). By the terms
<span class='pageno' title='233' id='Page_233'></span>
of that decree two other SS functionaries were charged with the
responsibility for the re-Germanization program, the Higher SS
and Police Leaders and the Gestapo. Paragraph III of the decree
provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“III. The Higher SS and Police Fuehrer will further the re-Germanization
actions with every means at their disposal and
continuously take stock of their success. In case they find
that obstacles are put in the way of a re-Germanization
action, they will report on their findings to the competent
State Police (Superior) Office for appropriate measures.
Where it proves to be impossible to attain re-Germanization
even by forcible measures taken by the State Police, they will
apply for a revocation of the naturalization through the Reich
Fuehrer SS, Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of
German Nationhood and give notice to the competent State
Police (Superior) Office.” (<span class='it'>R-112</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Paragraph IV of the decree provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“IV. In the course of fulfilling their duties imposed on them
by this Decree the competent State Police (Superior) Offices
will take in particular the following measures:”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“4. They will assist the Higher SS and Police Fuehrer in their
task of re-Germanization, particularly in removing obstacles
by forcible measures whenever there is opposition to re-Germanization.
Before ordering forcible measures by the State
Police they will give the Counsellor of the person in question
an opportunity to state his opinion.</p>

<p>“5. They will take into protective custody all persons, with
regard to whom the Higher SS and Police Fuehrer has applied
for revocation of their naturalization and will order their imprisonment
in a Concentration Camp.” (<span class='it'>R-112</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the final stage of the process, the resettlement of the conquered
lands by racially and politically desirable Germans, still other SS
agencies participated. The National Socialist Yearbook for 1941
states that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Numerous SS-leaders and SS-men helped with untiring effort
in bringing about this systematic migration of peoples, which
has no parallel in history.</p>

<p>“There were many authoritative and administrative difficulties
which, however, were immediately overcome due to the
unbureaucratic working procedure. This was especially
guaranteed above all by the employment of SS leaders.</p>

<p>“The procedure called ‘<span class='it'>Durchschleusung</span>’ (literally, ‘passing
through the lock’) takes 3 to 4 hours as a rule. The resettler
<span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span>
is passed through 8 to 9 offices, following each other in organic
order: registration office, card-index office, certificate and
photo-office, property office, and biological hereditary and
sanitary test office. The latter was entrusted to doctors and
medical personnel of the SS and of the Armed Forces. The
SS-Corps Areas [<span class='it'>Oberabschnitte</span>] Alpenland, North-West,
Baltic Sea, Fulda-Werra, South and South East, the SS-Main
Office [<span class='it'>SS-Hauptamt</span>], the NPEA (National Political Education
Institution) Vienna, and the SS-Cavalry-School in Hamburg
provided most of the SS-Officer and SS-Non-Coms who
worked at this job of resettlement.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The settlement, establishment and care of the newly won
peasantry in the liberated Eastern territory will be one of
the most cherished tasks of the SS in the whole future.”
(<span class='it'>2163-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<h3>E. <span class='it'>Defendant’s Membership in the SS.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of its development from a group of strong armed
bodyguards, some 200 in number, to a complex organization participating
in every field of Nazi endeavor, the SS found room for
its members in high places. Persons in high places moreover, found
for themselves a position in the SS. Of the defendants charged in
the indictment at least 7 were high ranking officers in the SS. They
are the defendants Ribbentrop, Hess, Kaltenbrunner, Bormann,
Sauckel, Neurath, and Seyss-Inquart. The vital part that Kaltenbrunner
played in the SS, the SD, and the entire Security Police
system is discussed in Section 6 on the Gestapo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With respect to the other six defendants, the facts as to their
membership in the SS are to be found in two official publications.
The first is the membership list of the SS as of 1 December 1936.
On line 2, page 8, of that publication, there appears the name
“Hess, Rudolf,” followed by the notation, “By authority of the
Fuehrer the right to wear the uniform of an SS Obergruppenfuehrer.”
In the 1937 edition of the same membership list, line
50, page 10, there appears the name “Bormann, Martin,” and in
line with his name on the opposite page, under the heading “Gruppenfuehrer,”
appears the following date “20.4.37.” In the same
edition, line 56, page 12, is the name “von Neurath, Konstantin”
and on the opposite page, under the column headed “Gruppenfuehrer,”
the date “18.9.37.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second publication is “<span class='it'>Der Grossdeutsche Reichstag</span>” for the
Fourth Voting Period, edited by E. Kienast, Ministerial Director
<span class='pageno' title='235' id='Page_235'></span>
of the German Reichstag, an official handbook containing biographical
data as to members of the Reichstag. On page 349 the
following appears: “von Ribbentrop, Joachim, <span class='it'>Reichsminister des
Auswaertigen</span>, SS Obergruppenfuehrer”; and on page 360 the
following: “Sauckel, Fritz, <span class='it'>Gauleiter</span> and <span class='it'>Reichsstatthalter</span> in
Thuringen, SS Obergruppenfuehrer”; and on page 389 the following:
“Seyss-Inquart, Arthur, Dr. Jur., Reichsminister, SS Obergruppenfuehrer.”</p>

<h3>F. <span class='it'>Conclusion.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>It is the prosecution’s contention that the SS, as defined in
Appendix B of the Indictment, was unlawful. Its participation
in every phase of the conspiracy alleged in Count One is clear.
As an organization founded on the principle that persons of
“German blood” were a “master race,” it exemplified a basic
Nazi doctrine. It served as one of the means through which
the conspirators acquired control of the German government.
The operations of the SD, and of the <span class='it'>SS Totenkopf Verbaende</span> in
concentration camps, were means used by the conspirators to
secure their regime and terrorize their opponents as alleged in
Count One. All components of the SS were involved from the
very beginning in the Nazi program of Jewish extermination.
Through the <span class='it'>Allgemeine SS</span> as a para-military organization, the
<span class='it'>SS Verfuegungstruppe</span> and <span class='it'>SS Totenkopf Verbaende</span> as professional
combat forces, and the <span class='it'>Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle</span> as a fifth
column agency, it participated in preparations for aggressive war,
and, through its militarized units, in the seizure of Austria, the
invasion of Czechoslovakia, the attack on Poland, and the waging
of aggressive war in the West and in the East, as set forth in
Counts One and Two of the Indictment. In the course of such war,
all components of the SS had a part in the war crimes and crimes
against humanity, set forth in Counts Three and Four,—the
murder and ill treatment of civilian populations in occupied territory,
the murder and ill treatment of prisoners of war, and the
Germanization of occupied territories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The evidence has shown that the SS was a single enterprise—a
unified organization. Some of its functions were, of course, performed
by one branch, or department or office, some by another.
No single branch or department participated in every phase of
its activity. But every branch and department and office was
necessary to the functioning of the whole. The situation is much
the same as in the case of the individual defendants at the bar.
Not all participated in every act of the conspiracy; but all performed
a contributing part in the whole criminal scheme.
<span class='pageno' title='236' id='Page_236'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The evidence has shown, not only that the SS was an organization
of volunteers but that applicants had to meet the strictest
standards of selection. It was not easy to become an SS member.
That was true of all branches of the SS. During the course of the
war, as the demands for manpower increased and the losses of
the Waffen SS grew heavier and heavier, there were occasions
when men drafted for compulsory military service were assigned
to units of the <span class='it'>Waffen SS</span> rather than to the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>. Those
instances were relatively few. Evidence of recruiting standards of
the Waffen SS in 1943 has shown that membership in that branch
was as essentially voluntary and highly selective as in other
branches. The fact that some individuals may have been arbitrarily
assigned to some Waffen SS unit has no bearing on the
issue before the tribunal, which is this, whether the SS was or was
not an unlawful organization. Doubtless some of the members of
the SS, or of other of the organizations alleged to be unlawful,
might desire to show that their participation in the organization
was small or innocuous, that compelling reasons drove them to
apply for membership, that they were not fully conscious of its
aims, or that they were mentally irresponsible when they became
members. Such facts might or might not be relevant if they were
on trial. But in any event this is not the forum to try out such
matters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question before this Tribunal is simply this, whether the
SS was or was not an unlawful organization. The evidence has
fully shown what the aims and activities of the SS were. Some
of these aims were stated in publications. The activities were so
widespread and so notorious, covering so many fields of unlawful
endeavor, that the illegality of the organization could not have
been concealed. It was a notorious fact, and Himmler himself
admitted that in 1936, when he said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I know that there are people in Germany now who become
sick when they see these black coats. We know the reason
and we don’t expect to be loved by too many.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It was at all times the exclusive function and purpose of the SS
to carry out the common objectives of the conspirators. Its activities
in carrying out those functions involved the commission of
the crimes defined in Article 6 of the Charter. By reason of its
aims and the means used for the accomplishment thereof, the SS
should be declared a criminal organization in accordance with
Article 9 of the Charter.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg248a'>6. THE GEHEIME STAATSPOLIZEI (GESTAPO) AND SICHERHEITSDIENST (SD)</h2>

<p class='pindent'>This section on the <span class='it'>Geheime Staatspolizei</span> (GESTAPO) includes
evidence on the criminality of the <span class='it'>Sicherheitsdienst</span> (SD) of the
<span class='it'>Schutzstaffel</span> (SS). In the Indictment the SD is included by
special references as a part of the SS, since it originated as a part
of the SS and always retained its character as a party organization,
as distinguished from the GESTAPO, which was a State
<span class='pageno' title='249' id='Page_249'></span>
organization. As will be shown in this section, however, the
GESTAPO and the SD were brought into close working relationship,
the SD serving primarily as the information-gathering
agency and the GESTAPO as the executive agency of the police
system established by the Nazis for the purpose of combatting the
political and ideological enemies of the Nazi regime. This close
working relationship between the GESTAPO and the SD was accomplished
by the appointment of Himmler, the Reichsfuehrer of
the SS, to the position of Chief of the German Police. What is
proved in this section with respect to the criminality of the SD
applies directly to the case against the SS. The relationship between
the SS and the GESTAPO is considered in section 5 on the
SS.</p>

<h3>A. <span class='it'>Development of the Gestapo and the SD.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Development of the GESTAPO.</span> The <span class='it'>Geheime Staatspolizei</span>,
or GESTAPO, was first established in Prussia on 26 April 1933
by Goering, with the mission of carrying out the duties of political
police with or in place of the ordinary police authorities. The
GESTAPO chief was given the rank of a higher police authority
and was subordinated only to the Minister of the Interior, to whom
was delegated the responsibility of determining its functional and
territorial jurisdiction (<span class='it'>2104-PS</span>). Pursuant to this law, and on
the same date, the Minister of the Interior issued a decree on the
reorganization of the police which established a State Police
Bureau in each government district of Prussia subordinate to the
Secret State Police Bureau in Berlin. (<span class='it'>2371-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 30 November 1933 Goering issued a decree for the Prussian
State Ministry and for the Reichs Chancellor which acknowledged
the valuable services which the GESTAPO was able to render to
the State and which placed the GESTAPO under his direct supervision
as Chief. The GESTAPO was thereby established as an
independent branch of the Administration of the Interior, responsible
directly to Goering as Prussian Prime Minister. This decree
gave the GESTAPO jurisdiction over the political police matters
of the general and interior administration and provided that the
district, county, and local police authorities were subject to the
directives of the GESTAPO (<span class='it'>2105-PS</span>). By a decree of 8 March
1934 the regional State Police offices were separated from their
organizational connection with the district government and established
as independent authorities of the GESTAPO. (<span class='it'>2113-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parallel to the development of the GESTAPO in Prussia, the
Reichsfuehrer SS, Heinrich Himmler, created in Bavaria the
<span class='pageno' title='250' id='Page_250'></span>
Bavarian Political Police and also directed the formation of
political police forces in the other federal states outside of
Prussia. The unification of the political police of the various
states took place in the spring of 1934 when Hermann Goering appointed
Himmler the Deputy Chief of the Prussian GESTAPO in
place of the former Deputy Chief, Diels. Himmler thereby obtained
unified control over the political police forces throughout the Reich.
(<span class='it'>1680-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 10 February 1936 the basic law for the GESTAPO was
promulgated by Goering as Prussian Prime Minister. This law
provided that the Secret State Police had the duty to investigate
and to combat in the entire territory of the State all tendencies
inimical to the State, and declared that orders in matters of the
Secret State Police were not subject to the review of the administrative
courts (<span class='it'>2107-PS</span>). On the same date, 10 February 1936,
a decree for the execution of said law was issued by Goering as
Prussian Prime Minister and by Frick as Minister of the Interior.
This decree provided that the GESTAPO had authority to enact
measures valid in the entire area of the State and measures
affecting that area, that it was the centralized agency for collecting
political intelligence in the field of political police, and that it
administered the concentration camps. The GESTAPO was given
authority to make police investigations in cases of criminal attacks
upon Party as well as upon State. (<span class='it'>2108-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 28 August 1936 a circular of the Reichsfuehrer SS and Chief
of the German Police provided that as of 1 October 1936 the
political police forces of the German provinces were to be called
the “<span class='it'>Geheime Staatspolizei</span>” (Secret State Police). The regional
offices were still to be described as State Police (<span class='it'>2372-PS</span>). On
20 September 1936 a circular of the Minister of the Interior commissioned
the GESTAPO Bureau in Berlin with the supervision
of the duties of the political police commanders in all the States of
Germany. (<span class='it'>L-297</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The law relating to financial measures in connection with the
police of 19 March 1937 provided that officials of the GESTAPO
were to be considered direct officials of the Reich and their salaries,
in addition to the operational expenses of the whole State Police,
were to be borne from 1 April 1937 on by the Reich. (<span class='it'>2243-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through the above laws and decrees the GESTAPO was established
as a uniform political police system operating throughout
the Reich and serving Party, State, and the Nazi leadership.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Development of the SD.</span> In 1932 the Reichsfuehrer of the
SS, Heinrich Himmler, created the <span class='it'>Sicherheitsdienst</span>, or SD, as an
<span class='pageno' title='251' id='Page_251'></span>
intelligence service of the SS under the then SS-Standartenfuehrer
Reinhard Heydrich. (<span class='it'>1680-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 9 June 1934, the NSDAP issued an ordinance which merged
all information facilities then existing within the Party organization
into the SD, and the SD was established as the sole Party
information service. (<span class='it'>1680-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of its development, the SD came into increasingly
closer cooperation with the GESTAPO and also with the <span class='it'>Reich
Kriminalpolizei</span>, the Criminal Police, or KRIPO. The GESTAPO
and the KRIPO considered together were called the <span class='it'>Sicherheitspolizei</span>,
the Security Police, or SIPO. The SD was also called upon
to furnish information to various State authorities. On 11 November
1938 a decree of the Reich Minister of the Interior declared
that the SD was to be the intelligence organization for the State as
well as for the Party, that it had the particular duty of supporting
the Secret State Police, and that it thereby became active on a
national mission. These duties necessitated a close cooperation
between the SD and the authorities for the General and Interior
Administration. (<span class='it'>1680-PS</span>; <span class='it'>1638-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through the above laws and decrees the SD was established as
a uniform political information service operating throughout the
Reich and serving Party, State, and the Nazi leadership.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Consolidation of the GESTAPO and the SD.</span> The first step
in the consolidation of the political police system of the State (the
GESTAPO) and the information service of the Nazi Party (the
SD) took place in the spring of 1934 when Goering appointed
Himmler Deputy Chief of the GESTAPO. Heydrich was the head
of the SD under Himmler, and when Himmler took over the actual
direction of the GESTAPO, these two agencies were in effect
united under one command. (<span class='it'>1956-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2460-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 17 June 1936, “for the uniformity of police duties in the
Reich,” the position of Chief of the German Police was established
in the Reich Ministry of the Interior, to which was assigned the
direction and protection of all police affairs within the jurisdiction
of the Reich. By this law Himmler was appointed Chief of the
German Police under Frick, the Reich Minister of the Interior,
and was given the right to participate in the sessions of the Reich
Cabinet as Chief of the German Police. (<span class='it'>2073-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 26 June 1936 Himmler issued a decree providing for the
appointment of a chief of the uniformed police and of a chief of
the Security Police. This decree divided the German police system
into two principal branches:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>(<span class='it'>a</span>) <span class='it'>Ordnungspolizei</span> (ORPO or Regular Police).
<span class='pageno' title='252' id='Page_252'></span></p>

<p>(<span class='it'>b</span>) <span class='it'>Sicherheitspolizei</span> (SIPO or Security Police).</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The <span class='it'>Ordnungspolizei</span> was composed of the <span class='it'>Schutzpolizei</span> (Safety
Police), the <span class='it'>Gendarmerie</span> (Rural Police), and the <span class='it'>Gemeindepolizei</span>
(Local Police). The <span class='it'>Sicherheitspolizei</span> was composed of the <span class='it'>Reich
Kriminalpolizei</span> (KRIPO) and the <span class='it'>Geheime Staatspolizei</span> (GESTAPO).
Daluege was named head of the <span class='it'>Ordnungspolizei</span> and
Heydrich was named head of the <span class='it'>Sicherheitspolizei</span>. Since Heydrich
was also head of the SD, he took the new title of Chief of the
Security Police and SD. (<span class='it'>1551-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 27 September 1939 by order of Himmler, in his capacity as
Reichsfuehrer SS and Chief of the German Police, the central
offices of the GESTAPO and the SD, together with the Criminal
Police, were centralized in the office of the Chief of the Security
Police and SD under the name of the <span class='it'>Reichssicherheitshauptamt</span>,
Reich Security Main Office, or RSHA. Under this order the personnel
and administrative sections of each agency were coordinated
in <span class='it'>Amt</span> I and <span class='it'>Amt</span> II of the RSHA; the operational
sections of the SD became <span class='it'>Amt</span> III (except for foreign intelligence
which was placed in <span class='it'>Amt</span> VI); the operational sections of the
GESTAPO became <span class='it'>Amt</span> IV and the operational sections of the
KRIPO became <span class='it'>Amt</span> V. Ohlendorf was named the Chief of <span class='it'>Amt</span>
III, the SD within Germany; Mueller was named the Chief of <span class='it'>Amt</span>
IV, the GESTAPO; and Nebe was named the Chief of <span class='it'>Amt</span> V, the
KRIPO. (<span class='it'>L-361</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 27 September 1939 Heydrich, as Chief of the Security Police
and SD, issued a directive pursuant to the foregoing order of
Himmler, in which he ordered the designation and heading
“<span class='it'>Reichssicherheitshauptamt</span>” to be used exclusively in internal
relations of the Reich Ministry of the Interior, and the heading
“The Chief of the Security Police and SD” in transactions with
outside persons and offices. The directive provided that the
GESTAPO would continue to use the designation and heading
“<span class='it'>Geheime Staatspolizeiamt</span>” according to particular instructions.
(<span class='it'>L-361</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1944 most of the sections of the <span class='it'>Abwehr</span> (military intelligence)
were incorporated into the various sections of the RSHA
and into a new section connected with <span class='it'>Amt</span> VI, called the <span class='it'>Militaerisches
Amt</span>. (<span class='it'>2644-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Heydrich was Chief of the Security Police and SD (RSHA)
until his death on 4 June 1942, after which Himmler directed the
organization until the appointment of the defendant Ernst Kaltenbrunner
as Chief of the Security Police and SD. Kaltenbrunner
took office on 30 January 1943 and remained Chief of the Security
Police and SD (RSHA) until the end of the war. (<span class='it'>2644-PS</span>)</p>

of the Security Police and SD.” (<span class='it'>1551-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the central offices of the GESTAPO and SD, together

of pay accounts of the SD, since personnel of the former were
paid by the State and personnel of the latter were paid by the
Party. Subsection D, under SS-Obersturmbannfuehrer Rauff handled
technical matters, including the motor vehicles of the SIPO

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Amt</span> V was the KRIPO and was charged with combatting criminals.
Subsection V D was the criminalogical institute for the SIPO
handling matters of identification, chemical and biological investigations,
and technical research.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Amt</span> VI was concerned with foreign political intelligence and
contained subsections dealing with western Europe, Russia and
Japan, Anglo-American sphere, and central Europe. It contained
a special section dealing with sabotage.</p>

Freemasonry, Judaism, political churches, Marxism, and liberalism.

<p class='pindent'>The centralization of the main offices of the GESTAPO and
SD was not fully carried out in the regional organization. Within
Germany the regional offices of the GESTAPO and SD maintained
their separate identity and reported directly to the section
of the RSHA which had the jurisdiction of the subject matter.
They were, however, coordinated by the <span class='it'>Inspekteurs</span> of the Security
<span class='pageno' title='257' id='Page_257'></span>
Police and SD. The <span class='it'>Inspekteurs</span> were also under the supervision
of the Higher SS and Police leaders appointed for each <span class='it'>Wehrkreis</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Higher SS and Police leaders reported to the Reichsfuehrer
SS and Chief of the German Police in each <span class='it'>Wehrkreis</span> and supervised
not only the <span class='it'>Inspekteurs</span> of the Security Police and SD but
also the <span class='it'>Inspekteurs</span> of the Order Police and various subdivisions
of the SS. (<span class='it'>1285-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the occupied territories the organization developed as the
German armies advanced. Combined operational units of the Security
Police and SD, known as <span class='it'>Einsatz</span> Groups, operated with
and in the rear of the Army. These groups were officered by personnel
of the GESTAPO, the KRIPO, and the SD, and the enlisted
men were composed of Order Police and Waffen SS. They functioned
with various army groups. The <span class='it'>Einsatz</span> Groups were subdivided
into <span class='it'>Einsatzkommandos</span>, <span class='it'>Sonderkommandos</span>, and <span class='it'>Teilkommandos</span>,
all of which performed the functions of the Security
Police and SD with or closely behind the army. After the occupied
territories had been consolidated, the <span class='it'>Einsatz</span> Groups and
their subordinate parts were formed into permanent combined
offices of the Security Police and SD within prescribed geographical
locations. These combined forces were placed under the <span class='it'>Kommandeurs</span>
of the Security Police and SD, and the offices were organized
in sections similar to the RSHA headquarters. The <span class='it'>Kommandeurs</span>
of the Security Police and SD reported directly to
<span class='it'>Befehlshabers</span> of the Security Police and SD, who in turn reported
directly to the Chief of the Security Police and SD. In the occupied
territories, the Higher SS and Police leaders exercised more
direct control over the <span class='it'>Befehlshabers</span> and the <span class='it'>Kommandeurs</span> of the
Security Police and SD than within the Reich. They had authority
to issue direct orders so long as they did not conflict with the
Chief of the Security Police and SD who exercised controlling authority.

all tendencies dangerous to the State.” The decree issued for the
execution of said law gave the GESTAPO the authority to make
police investigations in treason, espionage, and sabotage cases,
“and in other cases of criminal attacks on Party and State.”

<span class='pageno' title='258' id='Page_258'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In referring to the above law, the Nazi jurist, Dr. Werner Best,
commented as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Not the State in its outward organic appearance but the
tasks of the leadership in the sense of the National-Socialist
idea is the object of protection.” (<span class='it'>2232-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The duties of the GESTAPO were described in 1938 as follows,
in an order published by the Party Chancery:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“To the GESTAPO has been entrusted the mission by the
Fuehrer to watch over and to eliminate all enemies of the
Party and the National Socialist State as well as all disintegrating
forces of all kinds directed against both.” (<span class='it'>1723-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In <span class='it'>Das Archiv</span>, January 1936, the duties of the GESTAPO were
described in part as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Since the National Socialist revolution, all open struggle and
all open opposition to the State and to the leadership of the
State is forbidden, and a Secret State Police as a preventive
instrument in the struggle against all dangers threatening
the State is indissolubly bound up with the National Socialist
Fuehrer-State.” (<span class='it'>1956-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The successful accomplishment of this mission to strike down
the political and ideological opponents of the Nazi conspiracy was
stated in the official magazine of the SIPO and SD on 1 February
1943 in the following words:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Secret State Police by carrying out these tasks, contributed
decisively to the fact that the National Socialist constructive
work could be executed in the past ten years without any
serious attempts of interference by the political enemies of
the nation.” (<span class='it'>1680-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The methods used by the GESTAPO were limited only by the
results to be obtained.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The duties of the political police and the necessary means
for their performance are not chosen freely but are prescribed
by the foe. Just like the operations of an army against the
outward enemy and the means to fight this enemy cannot be
prescribed, so the political police also must have a free hand
in the choice of the means necessary at times to fight the attempts
dangerous to the State.” (<span class='it'>2232-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The GESTAPO was not restricted to the limitations of written
law. The Nazi jurist, Dr. Werner Best, states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“As long as the ‘police’ carries out the will of the leadership,
it is acting legally.” (<span class='it'>1852-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The GESTAPO was given the express power to take action outside
the law in the occupied territories. The laws pertaining to the
<span class='pageno' title='259' id='Page_259'></span>
administration of Austria and the Sudetenland provided that the
Reichsfuehrer SS and Chief of the German Police will take measures
for the maintenance of security and order “even beyond the
legal limitation otherwise laid down for this purpose.” (<span class='it'>1437-PS</span>;
<span class='it'>1438-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The actions and orders of the GESTAPO were not subject to
judicial review. The decision of the Prussian High Court of Administration
on 2 May 1935 held that the status of the GESTAPO
as a special police authority removed its orders from the jurisdiction
of the Administrative Tribunals. The court said that under
the law of 30 November 1933 the only redress available was by
appeal to the next higher authority within the GESTAPO itself.
(<span class='it'>2347-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The basic law of 10 February 1936 on the powers of the GESTAPO
provided specifically in Section VII:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Orders in matters of the Secret State Police are not subject
to the review of the administrative courts.” (<span class='it'>2107-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Concerning the power of the GESTAPO to act outside the law, the
Nazi jurist, Dr. Werner Best, states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“It is no longer a question of law but a question of fate
whether the will of the leadership lays down the ‘right’ rules,
i.e., rules feasible and necessary for police action—the ‘police’
law suitable for and beneficial to the people. Actual misuse
of the legislative power by a people’s leadership—be it a
harmful severity or weakness—will, because of the violations
of the ‘laws of life,’ be punished in history more surely by
fate itself through misfortune, overthrow and ruin, than by
a State Court of Justice.” (<span class='it'>1852-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The great power of the GESTAPO was “<span class='it'>Schutzhaft</span>”—the
power to imprison people without judicial proceedings on the
theory of “protective custody.” This power was based upon the
law of 28 February 1933 which suspended the clauses of the Weimar
Constitution guaranteeing civil liberties to the German people,
including Article 114 thereof, which provided that an abridgement
of personal liberty was permissible only by authority of law.
(<span class='it'>2499-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In April 1934 the Reich Minister of the Interior issued a decree
(which was not made public) stating that in view of the stabilizing
of the national situation it had become feasible to place restrictions
upon the exercise of protective custody and providing
for limitations upon its exercise. (<span class='it'>L-301</span>; <span class='it'>779-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The GESTAPO did not observe such limitations, and the practice
of taking people into protective custody increased greatly in
<span class='pageno' title='260' id='Page_260'></span>
1934. The GESTAPO did not permit lawyers to represent persons
taken into protective custody and, in one instance, counsel were
themselves placed in protective custody for trying to represent
clients. Civil employees were investigated and taken into protective
custody by the GESTAPO without knowledge of their superiors.
(<span class='it'>775-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>As of 1 February 1938, the Reich Minister of the Interior rescinded
previous decrees relating to protective custody, including
the decree of 12 April 1934, and issued new regulations. These
regulations provided that protective custody could be ordered:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * as a coercive measure of the Secret State Police
against persons who endangered the security of the people
and the State through their attitude, in order to counter all
aspirations of enemies of the people and State”;</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>that the GESTAPO had the exclusive right to order protective
custody; that protective custody was to be executed in the State
concentration camps; and that the GESTAPO, which authorized
release from protective custody, would review individual cases once
every three months. The Chief of the Secret Police was given authority
to issue the necessary regulations. (<span class='it'>1723-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The importance of this power of protective custody was set
forth in <span class='it'>Das Archiv</span>, 1936, in the following language:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The most effective preventive measure is without doubt the
withdrawal of freedom, which is covered in the form of protective
custody, if it is to be feared that the free activity of
the persons in question might endanger the security of the
State in any way. While protective arrest of short duration
is carried out in police and court prisons, the concentration
camps under the Secret State Police admit those taken into
protective custody who have to be withdrawn from public life
for a longer time.” (<span class='it'>1956-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The authority of the GESTAPO to administer the concentration
camps was set forth in the decree to the basic law of 10 February
1936. (<span class='it'>2108-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other methods used by the GESTAPO consisted of the dissolution
of associations, prohibition and dissolution of assemblies and
congregations, prohibition of publications of various kinds and
so forth. (<span class='it'>1956-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Tasks and Methods of the SD.</span> The task of the SD, after
it became the intelligence service for State and Party, was to obtain
secret information concerning the actual and potential enemies
of the Nazi leadership so that appropriate action could be
taken to destroy or neutralize opposition. (<span class='it'>1956-PS</span>)
<span class='pageno' title='261' id='Page_261'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The duties of the SD were stated by the Nazi jurist, Dr. Werner
Best, as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“As the intelligence service of the German National Socialist
Labor Party, the Security Service has first of all the task of
investigating and keeping a watch over all forces, events and
facts which are of importance for the domination of the National
Socialist idea and movement in German territory.
With this task follows that duty laid down by the Reich Minister
of the Interior—the duty of supporting the Security
Police—which is fulfilled, so far as it goes, under State orders.
In support of the tasks of the Security Police in securing the
ranks of the German people against interference and destruction
of any kind, the Security Service has to watch over every
sphere of life of the German people with regard to the activities
of inimical forces and the result of state and political
measures, and to inform continually the competent State authorities
and offices about the facts which have come to light.
Finally, it has to investigate politically and explore fundamentally
the activities and connections of the great, ideological,
arch-enemy of National Socialism and the German people,
in order thereby to render possible a purposeful and effective
fight against it.” (<span class='it'>1852-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>To accomplish this task, the SD created an organization of
agents and informants operating out of various SD regional offices
established throughout the Reich, and later in conjunction with
the GESTAPO and Criminal Police throughout the occupied territories.
The organization consisted of several hundred full-time
agents whose work was supplemented by several thousand part-time
informants. Informants were located in schools, shops,
churches, and all other spheres of German life, operating under
cover, and reporting any utterances or actions against the Nazi
Party, State or leadership. (<span class='it'>2614-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The SD had direct and powerful influence in the selection of
Nazi leaders. It investigated the loyalty and reliability of State
officials, evaluating them by their complete devotion to Nazi ideology
and the Hitler leadership. It secretly marked ballots and
thereby discovered the identity of persons who cast “No” votes
and “invalid” votes in the referenda. (<span class='it'>2614-PS</span>; <span class='it'>R-142</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The SD worked closely with the GESTAPO. An article in the
“<span class='it'>Voelkischer Beobachter</span>” published in <span class='it'>Das Archiv</span>, January 1936,
stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“As the Secret State Police can not carry out, in addition to
its primary executive tasks, this observation of the enemies
<span class='pageno' title='262' id='Page_262'></span>
of the state, to the extent necessary, there steps alongside to
supplement it the Security Service of the Reichsleader of the
SS, set up by the Deputy Fuehrer as the political intelligence
service of the movement, which puts a large part of the forces
of the movement mobilized by it into the service of the security
of the state.” (<span class='it'>1956-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>The Place of the GESTAPO and the SD in the Conspiracy.</span>
The GESTAPO was founded in April 1933 by Goering to serve
as a political police force in Prussia. Goering instructed Diels, the
first Deputy Chief of the GESTAPO, that his main task would be
the elimination of political opponents of National Socialism and
the fight against Communism. (<span class='it'>2460-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In “<span class='it'>Aufbau Einer Nation</span>,” published in 1934, Goering said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“For weeks I had been working personally on the reorganization
and at last I alone and upon my own decision and my
own reflection created the office of the Secret State Police.
This instrument which is so feared by the enemies of the
State, has contributed most to the fact that today there can
no longer be talk of a Communist and Marxist danger in Germany
and Prussia.” (<span class='it'>2344-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>So effective had the GESTAPO proven itself in combatting the
political opposition to National Socialism by the fall of 1933 that
Goering took over direct control of the GESTAPO (<span class='it'>2105-PS</span>).
Goering’s position as Chief of the GESTAPO in Prussia was recognized
by Himmler even after he became Chief of the German Police
in 1936 (<span class='it'>2372-PS</span>). Even as late as December 1938 Goering
continued to exercise his direct control over the Prussian GESTAPO.
(<span class='it'>D-183</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Himmler was named Deputy Chief of the GESTAPO in Prussia
in 1934. He used the GESTAPO, infused with new personnel recruited
in large part from the SS, to carry out the Roehm purge
of 30 June 1934. (<span class='it'>2460-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The GESTAPO, through its great power of arrest and confinement
to concentration camps without recourse to law, was the
principal means for eliminating enemies of the Nazi regime. Diels,
the former Deputy Chief of the GESTAPO under Goering, declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * From (1934) on the GESTAPO is responsible for
all deprivations of freedom and breaches of law and killings
in the political field which took place without court verdict.
Of primary importance among these was the shooting of numerous
persons who had been committed to jails by the courts
and then shot supposedly because of resistance. Many such
<span class='pageno' title='263' id='Page_263'></span>
cases were at that time published in the papers. For people
guilty of immorality such illegal shootings became the rule.
As for deprivation of freedom, there was no legal reason any
more for protective custody orders after 1934, which had still
been the case before that date, since from 1934 on the power
of the totalitarian state was so stabilized that the arrest of a
person for his own protection was only an excuse for arbitrary
arrest—without court verdict and without legal measures for
him. The terroristic measures, which led to the development
of the pure force system and punished to an increasing degree
each critical remark and each impulse of freedom with
the concentration camp, took on more and more arbitrary and
cruel forms. The GESTAPO became the symbol of the regime
of force.” (<span class='it'>2460-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<h3>D. <span class='it'>Criminal Responsibility of the Gestapo and SD.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>In the remainder of this section the criminal responsibility of
the GESTAPO and the SD will be considered with respect to certain
crimes against the peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity
which were in principal part committed by the centralized
political police system the development and organization of which
has previously been considered. In some instances the crimes were
committed in cooperation or conjunction with other groups and
organizations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frequent reference will be made to the phrase, “SIPO and SD.”
The SIPO and SD was composed of the following organizations,—the
GESTAPO, the KRIPO and the SD.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The GESTAPO was the largest of these, having a membership
of about 40,000 or 50,000 in 1943-45. It was the political police
force of the Reich. Much of its personnel consisted of transferees
from former political police forces of the States. Membership in
the GESTAPO was voluntary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The KRIPO was second largest, having a membership of about
15,000 in 1943-45. It was the criminal police force of the Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The SD was the smallest, having a membership of about 3,000
in 1943-45. It was the intelligence service of the SS. Membership
in the SD was voluntary. (<span class='it'>3033-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In common usage, and even in orders and decrees, the term “SD”
was used as an abbreviation in the term “SIPO and SD.” Since
the GESTAPO was the primary executive agency of the SIPO and
SD, and by far the largest, in most such cases the actual executive
action was carried out by personnel of the GESTAPO rather than
<span class='pageno' title='264' id='Page_264'></span>
of the SD or of the KRIPO. In occupied territories members of
the GESTAPO frequently wore SS uniforms. (<span class='it'>3033-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The term “Chief of the Security Police and SD” describes the
person who is the head of the GESTAPO, KRIPO and the SD, and
of their headquarters office called the RSHA. The “Chief of the
Security Police and SD” and the “head of the RSHA” are always
one and the same person. The RSHA was a department in the
Reich Ministry of the Interior and in the SS. Sometimes organizational
responsibility can be established by the fact that the orders
in question were issued by or submitted to <span class='it'>Amt</span> III of the RSHA
(in which case the action concerned the SD), to <span class='it'>Amt</span> IV of the
RSHA (in which case the action concerned the GESTAPO), or
to <span class='it'>Amt</span> V of the RSHA (in which case the action concerned the
KRIPO).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although the GESTAPO was the chief executive agency in the
political police system, all three organizations contributed to the
accomplishment of most of the criminal activities discussed hereinafter.</p>

<h3>E. <span class='it'>Crimes of the GESTAPO and SD against the Peace.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Prior to the invasion of Poland by Germany, “border incidents”
were fabricated by the GESTAPO and SD for the purpose of furnishing
Hitler with an excuse to wage war. (<span class='it'>2751-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Early in August, 1939, the plan was conceived by the Chief of
the Security Police and SD, Heydrich, to stage simulated border
raids by personnel of the GESTAPO and SD dressed as Poles.
To add authenticity, it was planned to take certain prisoners from
concentration camps, kill them by use of hypodermic injections,
and leave their bodies, clad in Polish uniforms, at the various
places where the incidents were planned to occur. The Chief of
the GESTAPO, Mueller, took a directing hand in these actions,
which were staged on 31 August 1939 in Beuthen, Hindenburg,
Gleiwitz, and elsewhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The leader of the SD agents who made the pretended attack on
the Gleiwitz radio station on 31 August, said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * In my presence, Mueller discussed with a man
named Mehlhorn plans for another border incident, in which
it should be made to appear that Polish soldiers were attacking
German troops. Germans in the approximate strength
of a company were to be used. Mueller stated that he had
12 or 13 condemned criminals who were to be dressed in Polish
uniforms and left dead on the ground of the scene of the incident,
to show that they had been killed while attacking. For
<span class='pageno' title='265' id='Page_265'></span>
this purpose they were to be given fatal injections by a doctor
employed by Heydrich. Then they were also to be given
gunshot wounds. After the incident members of the press and
other persons were to be taken to the spot of the incident. A
police report was subsequently to be prepared.</p>

<p>“4. Mueller told me that he had an order from Heydrich to
make one of those criminals available to me for the action at
Gleiwitz. The code name by which he referred to these criminals
was ‘Canned Goods.’</p>

<p>“5. The incident at Gleiwitz in which I participated was carried
out on the evening preceding the German attack on
Poland. As I recall, war broke out on the 1st of September
1939. At noon of the 31st August I received by telephone from
Heydrich the code word for the attack which was to take
place at 8 o’clock that evening. Heydrich said, ‘In order to
carry out this attack report to Mueller for Canned Goods.’
I did this and gave Mueller instructions to deliver the man
near the radio station. I received this man and had him laid
down at the entrance to the station. He was alive but he was
completely unconscious. I tried to open his eyes. I could
not recognize by his eyes that he was alive, only by his
breathing. I did not see the shot wounds but a lot of blood
was smeared across his face. He was in civilian clothes.</p>

<p>“6. We seized the radio station as ordered, broadcast a speech
of three to four minutes over an emergency transmitter, fired
some pistol shots and left.” (<span class='it'>2751-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2479-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>These were the “frontier incidents” to which Hitler referred in
his speech to the Reichstag on 1 September 1939. (Adolf Hitler,
“My New Order,” Reynal and Hitchcock, Inc., 1941, p. 687.)</p>

<h3>F. <span class='it'>War Crimes of the GESTAPO and SD.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>The GESTAPO and SD carried out mass murders of hundreds
of thousands of civilians of occupied countries as a part of
the Nazi program to exterminate political and racial undesirables
(“Einsatz Groups”).</span> About four weeks before the attack on Russia,
special task forces of the SIPO and SD, called <span class='it'>Einsatzgruppen</span> or
Special Task Groups, were formed on order of Himmler for the
purpose of following the German armies into Russia, combatting
partisans and members of resistance groups and exterminating
the Jews and Communist leaders. In the beginning four <span class='it'>Einsatz</span>
Groups were formed. <span class='it'>Einsatz</span> Group A, operating in the Baltic
States, was placed under the command of Stahlecker, former Inspector
of the SIPO and SD. <span class='it'>Einsatz</span> Group B, operating toward
<span class='pageno' title='266' id='Page_266'></span>
Moscow, was placed under the command of Nebe, the Chief of
<span class='it'>Amt</span> V (KRIPO) of the RSHA. <span class='it'>Einsatz</span> Group C, operating toward
Kiev, was placed under the command of Rasch and later
of Thomas, former Chief of the SIPO and SD in Paris. <span class='it'>Einsatz</span>
Group D, operating in the south of Russia, was placed under the
command of Ohlendorf, the Chief of <span class='it'>Amt</span> III (SD) of the RSHA.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Einsatz</span> Groups were officered by personnel of the GESTAPO,
the SD and the KRIPO. The men were drawn from the
Order Police and the Waffen SS. The groups had complements of
400 to 500 men, and had their own vehicles and equipment. By
agreement with the OKW and OKH, the <span class='it'>Einsatzkommandos</span> were
attached to certain Army corps or divisions. The Army assigned
the area in which the <span class='it'>Einsatzkommandos</span> were to operate, but all
operational directives and orders for the carrying out of executions
were given through the RSHA in Berlin. Regular courier
service and radio communications existed between the <span class='it'>Einsatz</span>
Groups and the RSHA.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The affidavit of Ohlendorf, Chief of the SD, who led <span class='it'>Einsatz</span>
Group D, reads in part as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“When the German Army invaded Russia, I was leader of
<span class='it'>Einsatzgruppe</span> D in the southern sector, and in the course of
the year during which I was leader of the <span class='it'>Einsatzgruppe</span> D,
it liquidated approximately 90,000 men, women and children.
The majority of those liquidated were Jews, but there were
also among them some Communist functionaries.</p>

<p>“In the execution of this extermination program the <span class='it'>Einsatzgruppen</span>
were subdivided into <span class='it'>Einsatzkommandos</span>, and the
<span class='it'>Einsatzkommandos</span> into still smaller units, the so-called <span class='it'>Sonderkommando</span>
and <span class='it'>Teilkommandos</span>. Usually the smaller units
were led by a member of the SD, the GESTAPO or the KRIPO.
The unit selected for this task would enter a village or city
and order the prominent Jewish citizens to call together all
Jews for the purpose of resettlement. They were asked to
hand over their personal belongings to the leaders of the unit,
and shortly before the execution, to surrender their outer
clothing. The men, women and children were led to a place
of execution which usually was located beside a deepened antitank
ditch. Then they were shot, kneeling or standing, and
the corpses were thrown into the ditch. I never permitted the
shooting by individuals in Group D, but ordered that several
of the men should shoot at the same time in order to avoid
direct personal responsibility. The leaders of the unit, or
especially designated persons, however, had to fire the last
shot against those victims who were not dead immediately.
<span class='pageno' title='267' id='Page_267'></span>
I learned from conversations with other group leaders that
some of them asked the victims to lie down flat on the ground
to be shot through the neck. I did not approve of these
methods.” (<span class='it'>2620-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The contention that these murders were carried out by subterfuge
and without force and terror is belied by the eyewitness account
of two such mass murders witnessed by Hermann Graebe,
who was manager and engineer in charge of the branch office of
the Solingen firm of Josef Jung in Sdolbunow, Ukraine, from September
1941 until January 1944. Graebe’s interest in the mass
executions derived from the fact that in addition to Poles, Germans,
and Ukrainians, he employed Jews on the various construction
projects under his supervision. He was personally acquainted
with the leader of the SIPO and SD who carried out the actions
hereinafter described with the aid of SS-men (most of whom wore
the SD arm-band) and Ukrainian militia. Graebe negotiated with
SS-major Putz, the leader of the SIPO and SD, for the release of
about 100 Jewish workers from the action which took place in
Rowno on 13 July 1942. The original letter which exempted these
Jewish workers from the action is attached to Graebe’s affidavit,
which states in part as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“In the evening of this day I drove to Rowno and posted myself
with Fritz Einsporn in front of the house in the Bahnhofstrasse
in which the Jewish workers of my firm slept. Shortly
after 22.00 the ghetto was encircled by a large SS detachment
and again about three times as many members of the Ukrainian
militia. Then the electric floodlights which had been
erected all around the ghetto were switched on. SS and militia
details of 4 to 6 members entered or at least tried to enter
the houses. Where the doors and windows were closed and
the inhabitants did not open upon the knocking, the SS men
and militia broke the windows, forced the doors and beams
with crowbars and entered the dwellings. The owners were
driven onto the street just as they were, regardless of whether
they were dressed or whether they had been in bed. Since the
Jews in most cases refused to leave their dwellings and resisted,
the SS and militia both applied force. With the help
of whippings, kicks and hits with the rifle butts they finally
succeeded in having the dwellings evacuated. The people were
chased out of their houses in such haste that the small children
who had been in bed had been left behind in several instances.
In the street women cried out for their children and children
for their parents. That did not prevent the SS from chasing
the people along the road, at double time, and hitting them
<span class='pageno' title='268' id='Page_268'></span>
until they reached a waiting freight train. Car after car was
filled, over it hung the screaming of women and children, the
cracking of whips and rifle shots. Since several families and
groups had barricaded themselves in especially strong buildings,
and the doors could not be forced with crowbars or
beams, these houses were now blown open with hand grenades.
Since the ghetto was near the railroad tracks in Rowno, the
younger people tried to get across the tracks and to a small
river to be outside of the ghetto. This sector being outside of
the floodlights was lighted by signal ammunition. All through
the night these beaten, chased and wounded people dragged
themselves across the lighted streets. Women carried their
dead children in their arms, children hugged and dragged by
their arms and feet their dead parents down the road toward
the train. Again and again the calls ‘Open the door,’ ‘Open
the door’ echoed through the ghetto.” (<span class='it'>2992-PS</span>)</p>

<p>The leader of <span class='it'>Einsatz</span> Group D, Ohlendorf, stated in his affidavit
that other <span class='it'>Einsatz</span> Group leaders required the victims to lie down
flat on the ground to be shot through the neck. Graebe describes
a mass execution of this kind which he observed carried out under
the direction of a man in SD uniform on 5 October 1943 at
Dubno, Ukraine, as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Thereupon in the company of Moennikes I drove to the construction
area and saw in its vicinity a heap of earth, about
30 meters long and 2 meters high. Several trucks stood in
front of the heap. Armed Ukrainian militia chased the people
off the trucks under the supervision of an SS man. The militia
men were guards on the trucks and drove them to and
from the excavation. All these people had the prescribed
yellow badges on the front and back of their clothes, and thus
were recognized as Jews.</p>

<p>“Moennikes and I went directly to the excavation. Nobody
bothered us. Now we heard shots in quick succession from
behind one of the earth mounds. The people who had gotten
off the trucks—men, women, and children of all ages—had
to undress upon the orders of an SS man who carried a riding
or dog whip. They had to put down their clothes in fixed
places, sorted according to shoes, over and underclothing, I
saw a pile of shoes of about 800 to 1,000 pairs, great piles of
laundry and clothing. Without screaming or crying these
people undressed, stood around by families, kissed each other,
said farewells and waited for the nod of another SS man, who
stood near the excavation, also with a whip in his hand. During
the 15 minutes that I stood near the excavation I have
<span class='pageno' title='269' id='Page_269'></span>
heard no complaint and no request for mercy. I watched a
family of about 8 persons, a man and a woman, both about
50 with their children of about 1, 8 and 10, and two grown-up
daughters of about 20 to 24. An old woman with snow-white
hair held the one-year-old child in her arms and sang
for it, and tickled it. The child was squeaking from joy. The
couple looked on with tears in their eyes. The father held the
hand of a boy about 10 years old and spoke to him softly; the
boy was fighting his tears. The father pointed toward the
sky, fondled his hand, and seemed to explain something to
him. At that moment the SS-man at the excavation called
something to his comrades. The latter counted off about 20
persons and instructed them to walk behind the earth mound.
Among them was the family which I had mentioned. I remember
very well a girl, blackhaired and slender, passing
near me; she pointed at herself and said, ‘23 years.’ I walked
around the mound, and stood in front of a tremendous grave.
Closely pressed together the people were lying on top of each
other so that only their heads were visible. Several of the
people shot still moved. Some lifted their arms and turned
their heads to show that they were still alive. The excavation
was already two-thirds full. I estimated that it contained
about 1,000 people. I looked for the man who did the shooting.
I saw an SS-man who sat at the rim of the narrow end
of the excavation, his feet dangling into the excavation. On
his knees he had a machine pistol and he was smoking a cigarette.
The completely naked people descended a stairway
which was dug into the clay of the excavation and slipped over
the heads of the people lying there already to the place to
which the SS-man directed them. They laid themselves in
front of the dead or injured people, some touched tenderly
those who were still alive and spoke to them in a low voice.
Then I heard a number of shots. I looked into the excavation
and saw how the bodies jerked or the heads rested already motionless
on top of the bodies that lay before them. Blood was
running from their necks. I was surprised that I was not
chased away, but I saw there were two or three postal officers
in uniform nearby. Now already the next group approached,
descended into the excavation, lined themselves up
against the previous victims and was shot. When I walked
back, around the mound, I noticed again a transport which
had just arrived. This time it included sick and frail persons.
An old, very thin woman with terribly thin legs was undressed
by others who were already naked, while two persons
<span class='pageno' title='270' id='Page_270'></span>
held her up. Apparently the woman was paralyzed. The naked
people carried the woman around the mound. I left with Moennikes
and drove with my car back to Dubno.” (<span class='it'>2992-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are two reports by Stahlecker, the Chief of <span class='it'>Einsatz</span> Group
B, available. The first report, found in Himmler’s personal files,
states that during the first four months of the Russian campaign
<span class='it'>Einsatz</span> Group A murdered 135,000 Communists and Jews, and
carried out widespread destruction of homes and villages and other
vast crimes. Enclosure 8 to this Stahlecker report is a careful survey
of the number of persons murdered, classified as to country,
and whether Jew or Communist, with totals given in each instance.
This report discloses that the <span class='it'>Einsatz</span> Groups frequently enlisted
the aid of the local populations in the extermination program. It
states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“In view of the extension of the area of operations and the
great number of duties which had to be performed by the Security
Police, it was intended from the very beginning to obtain
the cooperation of the reliable population for the fight
against vermin—that is, mainly the Jews and Communists.”
(<span class='it'>L-180</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>With respect to extermination of Jews the report stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“From the beginning it was to be expected that the Jewish
problem could not be solved by pogroms alone. In accordance
with the basic orders received, however, the cleansing activities
of the Security Police had to aim at a complete annihilation
of the Jews. Special detachments reinforced by selected
units—in Lithuania partisan detachments, in Latvia units
of the Latvian auxiliary police—therefore performed extensive
executions both in towns and in rural areas. The actions
of the execution detachments were performed smoothly.

<p class='pindent'>The second report from <span class='it'>Einsatz</span> Group A (<span class='it'>L-180</span>) reports the
extermination of nearly 230,000 persons. With respect to Esthonia,
it states in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Only by the SIPO and SD were the Jews gradually executed
as they became no longer required for work. Today there
are no longer any Jews in Esthonia.”</p>

</div>

<p>With respect to Latvia, the report states in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Up to October 1941 approximately 30,000 Jews had been
executed by these <span class='it'>Sonderkommandos</span>. The remaining Jews
who were still indispensable from the economic point of view
were collected in Ghettos, which were established in Riga,
Duenaburg and Libau.”</p>

</div>

<p>With respect to Lithuania, the report states in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Therefore by means of selected units—mostly in the proportion
of 1:8—first of all the prisons, and then systematically,
district by district, the Lithuanian sector was cleansed of
Jews of both sexes. Altogether 136,421 people were liquidated
<span class='pageno' title='272' id='Page_272'></span>
in a great number of single actions. As the complete liquidation
of the Jews was not feasible, as they were needed for
labor, Ghettos were formed which at the moment are occupied
as follows: Kauen approximately 15,000 Jews; Wilna approximately
15,000 Jews; Schaulen approximately 4,500 Jews.
These Jews are used primarily for work of military importance.
For example, up to 5,000 Jews are employed in 3 shifts
on the aerodrome near Kauen on earthworks and work of that
sort.”</p>

</div>

<p>With respect to White Russia, the report states in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“In view of the enormous distances, the bad condition of the
roads, the shortage of vehicles and petrol, and the small forces
of Security Police and SD, it needs the utmost effort to be
able to carry out shootings in the country. Nevertheless 41,000
Jews have been shot up to now.”</p>

</div>

<p>With respect to Jews from the Reich, the report states in part</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Since December 1940 transports containing Jews have arrived
at short intervals from the Reich. Of these, 20,000 Jews
were directed to Riga and 7,000 Jews to Minsk. Only a small
section of the Jews from the Reich is capable of working.
About 70-80 percent are women and children or old people
unfit for work. The death rate is rising continually also as a
result of the extraordinarily bad winter. In isolated instances
sick Jews with contagious disease were selected under the pretext
of putting them into a home for the aged or a hospital,
and executed.”</p>

<p class='noindent'>Attached as an enclosure to this report is a map entitled “Jewish
Executions Carried out by <span class='it'>Einsatzgruppe</span> A,” on which, by the
use of coffins as symbols, the number of Jews murdered in each
area covered by <span class='it'>Einsatz</span> Group A is shown (<span class='it'>Chart Number 4</span>). The
map shows thousands of Jews in ghettos, and an estimated 128,000
Jews “still on hand” in the Minsk area. Number of murdered, according
to figures beside the coffins, during the period covered by
this report, was 228,050.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 30 October 1941 the Commissioner of the territory of Sluzk
wrote a report to the Commissioner General, Minsk, in which he
severely criticized the actions of the <span class='it'>Einsatzkommandos</span> operating
in his area for the murder of all the Jews of Sluzk:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“On 27 October in the morning at about 8 o’clock a first lieutenant
of the police battalion No. 11 from Kauen (Lithuania)
appeared and introduced himself as the adjutant of the battalion
commander of the security police. The first lieutenant
explained that the police battalion had received the assignment
to effect the liquidation of all Jews here in the town of Sluzk,
<span class='pageno' title='273' id='Page_273'></span>
within two days. The battalion commander with his battalion
in strength of four companies, two of which were made up
of Lithuanian partisans, was on the march here and the action
would have to begin instantly. I replied to the first lieutenant
that I had to discuss the action in any case first with the commander.
About half an hour later the police battalion arrived
in Sluzk. Immediately after the arrival the conference with
the battalion commander took place according to my request.
I first explained to the commander that it would not very well
be possible to effect the action without previous preparation,
because everybody had been sent to work and that it would
lead to terrible confusion. At least it would have been his
duty to inform me a day ahead of time. Then I requested him
to postpone the action one day. However, he rejected this with
the remark that he had to carry out this action everywhere
and in all towns and that only two days were allotted for
Sluzk. Within these two days, the town of Sluzk had to be
cleared of Jews by all means. For the rest, as regards the
execution of the action, I must point out to my deepest regret
that the latter bordered already on sadism. The town itself
offered a picture of horror during the action. With indescribable
brutality on the part of both the German police officers
and particularly the Lithuanian partisans, the Jewish people,
but also among them White Ruthenians, were taken out of
their dwellings and herded together. Everywhere in the town
shots were to be heard and in different streets the corpses of
shot Jews accumulated. The White Ruthenians were in greatest
distress to free themselves from the encirclement. Regardless
of the fact that the Jewish people, among whom were
also tradesmen, were mistreated in a terribly barbarous way
in the face of the White Ruthenian people, the White Ruthenians
themselves were also worked over with rubber clubs and
rifle butts. There was no question of an action against the
Jews any more. It rather looked like a revolution. In conclusion
I find myself obliged to point out that the police battalion
has looted in an unheard of manner during the action, and
that not only in Jewish houses but just the same in those of
the White Ruthenians. Anything of use such as boots, leather,
cloth, gold and other valuables, has been taken away. On the
basis of statements of members of the armed forces, watches
were torn off the arms of Jews in public, on the streets, and
rings were pulled off the fingers in the most brutal manner. A
major of the finance department reported that a Jewish girl
was asked by the police to obtain immediately 5,000 rubles
<span class='pageno' title='274' id='Page_274'></span>
to have her father released. This girl is said to have actually
gone everywhere in order to obtain the money.” (<span class='it'>1104-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This report was submitted by the Commissioner General of
White Ruthenia to the Reich Commissioner for the Eastern Territories
on 1 November 1941 with the following comment:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I am submitting this report in duplicate so that one copy may
be forwarded to the Reich Minister. Peace and order cannot
be maintained in White Ruthenia with methods of that sort.
To bury seriously wounded people alive who worked their way
out of their graves again is such a base and filthy act that the
incidents as such should be reported to the Fuehrer and
Reichs Marshal.” (<span class='it'>1104-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On the same date by separate letter the Commissioner General
of White Ruthenia reported to the Reich Commissioner for the
Eastern Territories that he had received money, valuables, and
other objects taken by the police in the action at Sluzk and other
regions, all of which had been deposited with the Reich Credit institute
for the disposal of the Reich Commissioner. (<span class='it'>1104-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 21 November 1941 a report on the Sluzk incident was sent
to the personal reviewer of the permanent deputy of the Minister
of the Reich with a copy to Heydrich, the Chief of the Security
Police and SD. (<span class='it'>1104-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 6 November 1942 a secret report submitted to the Reich
Commissar for the East concerning the struggle against partisans
in the East discloses that destruction of villages continued, and
reports the execution of 1,274 partisan suspects and 8,350 Jews,
and the deportation of 1,217 people. This report was forwarded
on 10 December 1942 to the Reich Minister for the occupied Eastern
territories. (<span class='it'>1113-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The report from the prison administrator at Minsk as of 31 May
1943 to the General Commissioner for White Ruthenia states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The German, former dentist Ernst Israel Tichauer and his
wife Elisa Sara Tichauer, born Rosenthal, were delivered to
the Court-Prison by the SD (<span class='it'>Hauptscharfuehrer</span> Rube) on 13
April 1943. Since that date, the golden bridgework, crowns
and fillings of the received German and Russian Jews were
pulled out, respectively broken out by force. This always happened
1-2 hours before the actions in question.</p>

<p>“Since 13 April 1943, 516 German and Russian Jews were
liquidated. After careful investigation it was ascertained that
gold objects were only taken away during 2 actions, namely

About 50 percent of the Jews had gold teeth, bridges or fillings.

<p class='pindent'>Death vans were used by the <span class='it'>Einsatz</span> Groups to murder victims
by gas. These vans were built by the Saurer Works in Berlin and
other firms. The vans were built for the technical section of <span class='it'>Amt</span>
II of the RSHA, which sent them to the <span class='it'>Einsatz</span> Groups in the
field. They were first used in the spring of 1942 and continued
to be used throughout the war (<span class='it'>2348-PS</span>). The method of using
the vans is described by Ohlendorf in the following words:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“We received orders to use the car for the killing of women
and children. Whenever a unit had collected a sufficient number
of victims, a car was sent for their liquidation. We also
stationed these cars in the neighborhood of the transit camps
to which the victims had been brought. They were told that
they would be resettled and had to climb into the cars for that
purpose. Then the doors were closed and as soon as the cars
started moving the gas would enter. The victims died within
ten to fifteen minutes. The cars were driven to the burial
place where the corpses were taken out and buried.”
(<span class='it'>2620-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A letter from Becker, the operator of several death vans, written
to Rauff, the head of the technical section of <span class='it'>Amt</span> II of the RSHA,
on 16 May 1942, states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The overhauling of vans by groups D and C is finished. While
the vans of the first series can also be put into action if the
weather is not too bad the vans of the second series (Saurer)
stop completely in rainy weather. If it has rained for instance
for only one-half hour, the van cannot be used because it simply
skids away. It can only be used in absolutely dry weather.
It is only a question now whether the van can only be used
standing at the place of execution. First the van has to be
brought to that place, which is possible only in good weather.
The place of execution is usually 10-15 km away from the
highways and is difficult of access because of its location; in
damp or wet weather it is not accessible at all. If the persons
to be executed are driven or led to that place, then they realize
immediately what is going on and get restless, which is to be
avoided as far as possible. There is only one way left; to load
them at the collecting point and to drive them to the spot.</p>

<p>“I ordered the vans of group D to be camouflaged as house-trailers
by putting one set of window shutters on each side
<span class='pageno' title='276' id='Page_276'></span>
of the small van and two on each side of the larger vans, such
as one often sees on farm-houses in the country. The vans
became so well-known, that not only the authorities but also
the civilian population called the van “death van”, as soon
as one of these vehicles appeared. It is my opinion that the
van cannot be kept secret for any length of time, not even
camouflaged.</p>

<p>“* * * I should like to take this opportunity to bring the
following to your attention: several commands have had the
unloading after the application of gas done by their own men.
I brought to the attention of the commanders of those SK
concerned the immense psychological injuries and damages
to their health which that work can have for those men, even
if not immediately, at least later on. The men complained to
me about headaches which appeared after each unloading.</p>

<p>“* * * The application of gas usually is not undertaken
correctly. In order to come to an end as fast as possible, the
driver presses the accelerator to the fullest extent. By doing
that the persons to be executed suffer death from suffocation
and not death by dozing off as was planned. My directions
now have proved that by correct adjustment of the levers
death comes faster and the prisoners fall asleep peacefully.
Distorted faces and excretions, such as could be seen before,
are no longer noticed.” (<span class='it'>501-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The death vans were not always satisfactory. A telegram from
the commandant of the SIPO and SD “Ostland” to the RSHA,
<span class='it'>Amt</span> II D, on 15 June 1942, states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“A transport of Jews, which has to be treated in a special
way, arrives weekly at the office of the commandant of the
Security Police and the Security Service of White Ruthenia.</p>

<p>“The three S-vans, which are there, are not sufficient for that
purpose. I request assignment of another S-van (5-tons). At
the same time I request the shipment of 20 gas-hoses for the
three S-vans on hand (2 Diamond, 1 Saurer), since the ones
on hand are leaky already.” (<span class='it'>501-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reports of the various <span class='it'>Einsatz</span> Groups were summarized at

GESTAPO), and <span class='it'>Amt</span> V (the KRIPO) (<span class='it'>2752-PS</span>). One such report

in summary form the activities of the various <span class='it'>Einsatz</span> Groups during
<span class='pageno' title='277' id='Page_277'></span>
the month of October 1941. The report first discusses the stations

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The embitterment of the Ukrainian population against the
Jews is extremely great because they are thought responsible
for the explosions in Kiew. They are also regarded as informers
and agents of the NKVD who started the terror
against the Ukrainian people. As a measure of retaliation for
the arson at Kiew, all Jews were arrested and altogether 33,771
Jews were executed on the 29th and 30th September.
Money, valuables and clothing were secured and put at the
disposal of the National-Socialist League for Public Welfare
(NSV) for the equipment of the National Germans [<span class='it'>Volksdeutschen</span>]

<p>“In Cherson 410 Jews were executed as a measure of retaliation
for acts of sabotage. Especially in the area east of the

of Jews. In the course of this action 4,891 Jews were liquidated.

persons.” (<span class='it'>R-102</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These reports, circulated among the various offices of the RSHA,
brought general knowledge to the entire organization of the program
of mass murder conducted by these special task forces of the
SIPO and SD. (<span class='it'>R-102</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The activities of the <span class='it'>Einsatz</span> Groups continued throughout 1943
and 1944 under Kaltenbrunner as Chief of the SIPO and SD. New
groups were formed and sent into action in the West (<span class='it'>2890-PS</span>).
Under adverse war conditions, however, the program of extermination
was to a large extent changed to one of rounding up slave
labor for Germany. A letter written on 19 March 1943 from the
headquarters of a <span class='it'>Sonderkommando</span> (section of <span class='it'>Einsatz</span> Group C)
states as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“It is the task of the Security Police and of the Security Service
(SD) to discover all enemies of the Reich and fight against
them in the interest of security, and in the zone of operations
especially to guarantee the security of the army. Besides the
annihilation of active opponents all other elements who, by
virtue of their opinions or their past, may appear active as
enemies under favorable conditions, are to be eliminated
[<span class='it'>sind * * * auszumerzen</span>] through preventive measures.
The Security Police carries out this task according to the general
directives of the Fuehrer with all the required toughness.
Energetic measures are especially necessary in territories endangered
by the activity of hostile gangs. The competence of
the Security Police within the zone of operations is based on
the Barbarossa decrees. I deem the measures of the Security
<span class='pageno' title='281' id='Page_281'></span>
Police, carried out on a considerable scale during recent times,
necessary for the two following reasons:</p>

<p>“1. The situation at the front in my sector had become so serious
that the population, partly influenced by Hungarians
and Italians, who streamed back in chaotic condition, took
openly position against us.</p>

<p>“2. The strong expeditions of hostile gangs, who came especially
from the forest of Bryansk, were another reason. Besides
that, other revolutionary groups, formed by the population,
appeared suddenly in all districts. The providing of
arms evidently provided no difficulties at all. It would have
been irresponsible, if we had observed this whole activity without
acting against it. It is obvious that all such measures
bring about some harshness. I want to take up the significant
points of harsh measures:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right95percent'>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>“1.</span><p class='listPara'>The shooting of Hungarian Jews.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>“5.</span><p class='listPara'>The “shooting, while trying to escape” of Security
Service (SD) prisoners.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>“Chief of <span class='it'>Einsatz</span> Group C confirmed once more the correctness
of the measures taken, and expressed his recognition for
the energetic actions.</p>

<p>“With regard to the current political situation, especially in
the armament industry in the fatherland, the measures of the
Security Police have to be subordinated to the greatest extent
to the recruiting of labor for Germany. In the shortest
possible time, the Ukraine has to put at the disposal of the
armament industry 1 million workers, 500 of whom have to
be sent from our territory daily.</p>

<p>“The work of the field groups has therefore to be changed as
of now. The following orders are given:</p>

<p>“1. Special treatment is to be limited to a minimum.</p>

<p>“2. The listing of communist functionaries, activists and so
on, is to take place by roster only for the time being, without
arresting anybody. It is, for instance, no longer feasible to
arrest all the close relatives of a member of the communist
party. Although, members of the Komsomolz are to be arrested only
if they were active in a leading position.</p>

<p>“3. The activity of the labor offices, respective of recruiting
commissions, is to be supported to the greatest extent possible.
It will not be possible always to refrain from using force.
During a conference with the Chief of the Labor Commitment
<span class='pageno' title='282' id='Page_282'></span>
Staffs, an agreement was reached stating that wherever
prisoners can be released, they should be put at the disposal
of the Commissioner of the Labor Office. When searching
[<span class='it'>Uberholung</span>] villages, resp., when it has become necessary to
burn down a village, the whole population will be put at the
disposal of the Commissioner by force.</p>

<p>“4. As a rule, no more children will be shot.</p>

<p>“5. The reporting of hostile gangs as well as drives against
them is not affected hereby. All drives against these hostile
gangs can only take place after my approval has been obtained.</p>

<p>“6. The prisons have to be kept empty, as a rule. We have
to be aware of the fact that the Slavs will interpret all soft
treatment on our part as weakness and that they will act
accordingly right away. If we limit our harsh measures of
security police through above orders for the time being, that
is only done for the following reason. The most important
thing is the recruiting of workers. No check of persons to
be sent into the Reich will be made. No written certificates
of political reliability check or similar things will be issued.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * Shortly before the beginning of this campaign
[with U.S.S.R.] I was present in a group composed of the
Commanders in Chief (with their Chiefs of Staff) of the three
Armed Forces, of the Army groups, of Armies, and of the
corresponding groups in the Air Forces and Navy. Hitler
made an announcement to this group that special measures
<span class='pageno' title='283' id='Page_283'></span>
would have to be taken against political functionaries and
commissars of the Soviet army. He said that this would not
be an ordinary campaign but would be the clash of conflicting
ideologies. He further said that the political functionaries
and commissars were not to be considered as prisoners
of war but were to be segregated from other prisoners immediately
after their capture and were to be turned over to
special detachments of the SD which were to accompany the
German troops to Russia. He further said that when it was
not possible to turn over the political functionaries and commissars
to the SD, they were to be eliminated by the German
troops.” (<span class='it'>2884-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Chief of the SD, Otto Ohlendorf, describes this action in
the following words:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“In 1941, shortly after the start of the campaign against Russia,
an agreement was entered into between the Chief of the
Security Police and SD and the OKW and OKH to the effect
that the prisoner of war camps on the Eastern front should
be opened to <span class='it'>Einsatzkommandos</span> of the SIPO and SD so that
the prisoners could be screened. All Jews and Communist
functionaries were to be taken from the prisoner of war camps
by the <span class='it'>Einsatzkommandos</span> and executed outside the camps.
To my knowledge, this action was carried on throughout the
entire Russian campaign. In the other occupied territories
and within the Reich—to my knowledge—the GESTAPO had
been made responsible for this program in the Russian prisoner
of war camps. It was, to my knowledge, carried on
throughout the greater part of the war.” (<span class='it'>2622-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lahousen, chief of a division in the office of foreign intelligence
in the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>, states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * From the start of the campaign against the
U.S.S.R. the higher German political and military leadership
followed the policy of eliminating Russian commissars and
various other types of Russian prisoners of war captured by
the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>. In June and July 1941 I participated in a
conference which concerned itself with the treatment of Russian
commissars. * * * Obergruppenfuehrer Mueller
was present as representative of the RSHA, and he participated
in this matter because, as Chief of Section IV, he was
responsible for the carrying out of these measures. Jointly
with the SD and the GESTAPO he had the task of instituting
the necessary measures for the execution of commissars.
* * * In the discussion that followed, Mueller promised
in a peculiarly cynical manner that these executions would
<span class='pageno' title='284' id='Page_284'></span>
take place in the future outside the camp, so that the troops
would not be obliged to watch them. He promised further a
certain limitation in the concept of ‘Bolshevistically infected.’
This concept and its interpretation had been hitherto left to
the discretion of the SD <span class='it'>Sonderkommandos</span>. * * * An
agreement was concluded between the OKW, the GESTAPO
and the SD. Pursuant to this agreement Russian prisoners
of war under the control of the OKW were delivered to the
GESTAPO and SD for execution. The term ‘<span class='it'>Sonderbehandlung</span>’
in the official documents and way of speaking of the SD
was equivalent to ‘condemned to death’.” (<span class='it'>2846-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 17 July 1941 instructions were issued by the GESTAPO

In this department were handled matters concerning prisoners

1942, existed according to which captured Soviet Russian
political Commissars and Jewish soldiers were to be executed.
As far as I know proposals for execution of such PWs were
received from the various PW camps. Koenigshaus had to
prepare the orders for execution and submitted them to the
chief of section IV, Mueller, for signature. These orders were
made out so that one order was to be sent to the agency making

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>The GESTAPO and SD sent recaptured prisoners of war to
concentration camps where they were executed (“Bullet Decree”).</span>
In March 1944 the Chief of the Security Police and SD forwarded
an OKW order to regional SIPO and SD offices in which the OKW
ordered that, on recapture, every escaped officer and nonworking
NCO prisoner of war, with the exception of British and American
prisoners of war, were to be handed over to the SIPO and
SD, with the words “<span class='it'>Stufe III</span>”. Whether escaped British and
American officers and nonworking NCOs, upon recapture, should
be handed over to the SIPO and SD was to be decided by the High
Command of the Army. In connection with this order, the Chief
of the Security Police and SD (RSHA) issued instructions that the
GESTAPO <span class='it'>Leitstellen</span> should take over the escaped officers from
the camp commandants and transport them in accordance with a
procedure theretofore in force to the Mauthausen concentration
camp. The camp commandant was to be informed that the prisoners
were being handed over under the operation “<span class='it'>Kugel</span>”. On
the journey the prisoners of war were to be placed in irons. The
<span class='pageno' title='287' id='Page_287'></span>
GESTAPO <span class='it'>Leitstellen</span> were to make half-yearly reports, giving
numbers only, of the handing over of prisoners of war. Escaped
officer and nonworking NCO prisoners of war, with the exception
of British and Americans, recaptured by police stations were not
to be handed back to the Stalag command. The Stalag was to be
informed of the recapture and asked to surrender them with the
words “<span class='it'>Stufe III</span>”. (<span class='it'>1650-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 27 July 1944 an order from the 6th Corps Area Command
was issued on the treatment of prisoners of war, which provided
that prisoners of war were to be discharged from prisoner-of-war
status and transferred to the GESTAPO if they were guilty of
crimes, had escaped and been recaptured, or refused to work or
encouraged other prisoners not to work, or were screened out by
<span class='it'>Einsatzkommandos</span> of the SIPO and SD, or were guilty of sabotage.
No reports on transfers were required (<span class='it'>1514-PS</span>). This decree
was known as the “<span class='it'>Kugel Erlass</span>” (“Bullet Decree”). Prisoners
of war sent to Mauthausen concentration camp under it were
regarded as dead to the outside world and were executed. (<span class='it'>2478-PS</span>;
<span class='it'>2285-PS</span>.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>The GESTAPO and SD were responsible for establishing
and classifying concentration camps, and for committing racial
and political undesirables to concentration and annihilation camps
for slave labor and mass murder.</span> The first concentration camps
were established in 1933 at Dachau in Bavaria and at Oranienburg
in Prussia. The GESTAPO was given by law the responsibility
of administering the concentration camps. (<span class='it'>2108-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The GESTAPO had the sole authority to take persons into protective
custody, and orders for protective custody were carried out
in the State concentration camps. (<span class='it'>1723-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The GESTAPO issued the orders establishing concentration
camps, transforming prisoner of war camps into concentration
camps, designating concentration camps as internment camps,
changing labor camps into concentration camps, setting up special
sections for female prisoners, and so forth. (<span class='it'>D-50</span>; <span class='it'>D-46</span>.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Chief of the Security Police and SD ordered the classification
of concentration camps according to the seriousness of the
accusation and the chances for reforming the prisoners from the
Nazi viewpoint. The concentration camps were classified as Classes
I, II, or III. Class I was for the least serious prisoners, and Class
III for the most serious prisoners. (<span class='it'>1063-A-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Regional offices of the GESTAPO had the authority to commit
persons to concentration camps for short periods, at first 21 days
and later 56 days, but all other orders for protective custody had
<span class='pageno' title='288' id='Page_288'></span>
to be approved by the GESTAPO headquarters in Berlin. Orders
for protective custody issued by GESTAPO headquarters had to
be signed by or on behalf of the Chief of the Security Police and
SD, at first Heydrich, later Kaltenbrunner. (<span class='it'>2477-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Chief of the Security Police and SD had authority to fix
the length of the period of custody. During the war it was the
policy not to permit the prisoners to know the period of custody
and merely to announce the term as “until further notice”.
(<span class='it'>1531-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The local GESTAPO offices which made the arrests maintained
a register called the “<span class='it'>Haftbuch</span>.” In this register the names of all
persons arrested were listed, together with personal data, grounds
for the arrest, and disposition. When orders were received from
the GESTAPO headquarters in Berlin to commit persons who had
been arrested to concentration camps, an entry was made in the
<span class='it'>Haftbuch</span> to that effect. The reason assigned for the arrest and
commitment of persons to concentration camps usually was that,
according to the GESTAPO, the person endangered by his attitude
the existence and security of the people and the State. Further
specifications of grounds included such offenses as that of “working
against the Greater German Reich with an illegal resistance
organization,” “being a Jew,” “suspected of working for the detriment
of the Reich,” “being strongly suspected of aiding desertion,”
“because as a relative of a deserter he is expected to take advantage
of every occasion to harm the German Reich,” “refusal to work,”
“sexual intercourse with a Pole,” “religious propaganda,” “working
against the Reich,” “loafing on the job,” or “defeatist statements.”
Sometimes specification of the grounds simply referred
to an “action,” under which a large number of persons would be
arrested and sent to concentration camps. (<span class='it'>L-358</span>; <span class='it'>L-215</span>.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 16 December 1942, Mueller, Chief of the GESTAPO, reported
that, in connection with an increase in slave labor required by concentration
camps by 30 January 1943 the GESTAPO could round
up 45,000 Jews, including invalids, aged, and children. The telegram
stated:</p>

of the GESTAPO regional offices, in which he stated that Himmler,
Reichsfuehrer SS and Chief of the German Police, had given orders
on 14 December 1942 that at least 35,000 persons who were fit for
work had to be put into concentration camps not later than at the
end of January. The order further provided that Eastern or foreign
workers who had escaped or broken the labor contracts were
to be sent to the nearest concentration camps as quickly as possible,
and that inmates of detention rooms and educational work camps
who were fit for work should be delivered to the nearest concentration
camps. (<span class='it'>1063-D-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 23 March 1943, Mueller issued another directive referring to
said directive of 17 December 1942, in which he stated that measures
are to be carried out until 30 April ‘43. More explicit instructions
were given as to which concentration camps the slave laborers
were to be sent. He said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Care has to be taken that only prisoners who are fit for work

<p class='pindent'>On 21 April 1943, the Minister of Justice declared in a letter
that the RSHA had ordered on 11 March 1943 that all Jews who
were released from prison were to be handed over to the GESTAPO
for lifelong detainment in the concentration camps at Auschwitz
and Lublin. Poles released after an imprisonment of over six
months were to be transferred to the GESTAPO for internment
in a concentration camp for the duration of the war. (<span class='it'>701-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The arrest of Jews and their shipment to annihilation camps was
carried out under the direction of Eichmann, head of the section
handling Jews in the Gestapo. Eichmann’s staff was composed of
members of the SIPO, especially the GESTAPO. The Jews were
shipped on order of the SIPO and SD to annihilation camps in the
East. Eichmann estimated, and so reported to Himmler, that
4,000,000 Jews were killed in the annihilation camps in the East,
in addition to the 2,000,000 Jews shot by the <span class='it'>Einsatz</span> Groups. The
extermination of Jews in the annihilation camps was accomplished
mainly after the beginning of 1943, during the time Kaltenbrunner
was the Chief of the Security Police and SD. (<span class='it'>2615-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(5) <span class='it'>The GESTAPO and the SD participated in the deportation

disciplining of forced labor.</span> On 26 November 1942, Fritz Sauckel
transmitted a letter to the president of provincial employment offices
in which he stated that he had been advised by the Chief of
the Security Police and SD (RSHA) under date of 26 October
1942 that during the month of November the evacuation of Poles
in the Lublin district would begin in order to make room for the
settlement of persons of the German race. The Poles who were
evacuated as a result of this measure were to be put into concentration
camps for labor so far as they were criminal or asocial.
The remaining Poles who were suitable for labor were to be transported
without their families into the Reich, there to be put at the
disposal of the Labor Allocation Offices to serve as replacements
for Jews eliminated from the armament factories. (<span class='it'>L-61</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>During 1943 the program of mass murder carried out by the

at refusal to work were to be countered by the GESTAPO with
the severest measures, arrest and confinement in concentration

<p class='pindent'>(10) <span class='it'>The GESTAPO and SD were instructed to murder prisoners
in the SIPO and SD prisons to prevent their release by the
Allied armies.</span> On 21 July 1944, the <span class='it'>Kommandeur</span> of the SIPO and
SD for the District Radom forwarded an order of the <span class='it'>Befehlshaber</span>
of the SIPO and SD to the effect that it was essential that the
number of inmates of the SIPO and SD prisons be kept as low as
possible. Inmates were to be subjected only to short formal interrogations
and then to be sent by the quickest route to concentration
camps. Preparations were to be made for total clearance of
the prisons should the situation at the front necessitate such action.
In the case of sudden emergency precluding the evacuation of the
prisoners, they were to be shot and their bodies buried or otherwise
disposed of, the buildings to be dynamited, and so forth. In
similar circumstances, the Jews who were still employed in the
armament industries or in other work were to be dealt with in the
same way. The liberation of prisoners or Jews by the enemy was
to be avoided at all costs. (<span class='it'>L-53</span>)</p>

of the persons executed or murdered. On the eastern front the
victims were required not only to give up all their personal possessions,
but even to remove their outer garments prior to being murdered.

through Mueller, published an order authorizing the use of third
degree methods in interrogating where preliminary investigation

<h3>G. <span class='it'>Crimes of the GESTAPO and SD Against Humanity.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>The GESTAPO and the SD were primary agencies for the
persecution of the Jews.</span> The persecution of the Jews under the
Nazi regime is a story of increasingly severe treatment, beginning
with restrictions, then seizure and spoliation of property, commitment
to concentration camps, deportation, slave labor, and
finally mass murder. The responsibility of the GESTAPO and
the SD for the mass extermination program carried out by the
Einsatz Groups of the SIPO and SD and in the annihilation camps
to which Jews were sent by the SIPO and SD has already been
considered. In this subdivision, the place of the GESTAPO and
SD in the development of this persecution will be treated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Section B of the SD dealt with problems of nationality, including
minorities, race and national health, immigration, and resettlement.
Section B4 of the GESTAPO, headed by Eichmann,
dealt with Jewish affairs, including matters of evacuation, means
<span class='pageno' title='296' id='Page_296'></span>
of suppressing enemies of the people and State, and dispossession
of rights of German citizenship. One of the functions of the SD
was to furnish information concerning the Jews to the GESTAPO.
One of the functions of the GESTAPO was to carry out the Nazi
program of persecution of the Jews. (<span class='it'>L-185</span>; <span class='it'>L-219</span>.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The GESTAPO was charged with the enforcement of discriminatory
laws, such as those preventing Jews from engaging in
business, restricting their right to travel, and prohibiting them
from associating with gentiles. Violations of such restrictions resulted
in protective custody and confinement in concentration
camps by the GESTAPO. (<span class='it'>L-217</span>; <span class='it'>L-152</span>; <span class='it'>L-167</span>.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Chief of the Security Police and SD ordered the GESTAPO
and the SD to supervise the anti-Jewish pogrom staged in November
1938 following the von Rath incident in Paris. As many
Jews were to be arrested in all districts as the available jail space
would hold. Well-to-do Jews were to be singled out for arrest, and
primarily only healthy male adults of not too advanced age. Immediately
after completion of the arrests, the competent concentration
camp was to be notified in order to provide for speediest transfer
of Jews to the camps. (<span class='it'>3051-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 11 November 1938 Heydrich reported to Goering by secret
express letter on the results of the action as reported by the GESTAPO.
The report stated in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * The extent of the destruction of Jewish shops and
houses cannot yet be verified by figures. The figures given in
the reports: 815 shops destroyed, 171 dwelling houses set on
fire or destroyed, only indicate a fraction of the actual damage
caused, as far as arson is concerned. Due to the urgency of
the reporting, the reports received to date are entirely limited
to general statements such as ‘numerous’ or ‘most shops
destroyed.’ Therefore the figures given must have been exceeded
considerably.</p>

<p>“191 synagogues were set on fire, and another 76 completely
destroyed. In addition 11 parish halls, [<span class='it'>Gemeindehauser</span>]
cemetery chapels and similar buildings were set on fire and
3 more completely destroyed.</p>

<p>“20,000 Jews were arrested, also 7 Aryans and 3 foreigners.
The latter were arrested for their own safety.</p>

<p>“36 deaths were reported and those seriously injured were
also numbered at 36. Those killed and injured are Jews. One
Jew is still missing. The Jews killed include one Polish national,
and those injured include 2 Poles.” (<span class='it'>3058-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 31 July 1941 Goering sent the following order to the Chief of
the Security Police and SD, Heydrich:
<span class='pageno' title='297' id='Page_297'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Complementing the task that was assigned to you on 24 January
1939, which dealt with arriving at a solution of the
Jewish problem through furtherance of emigration and evacuation
as advantageous as possible, I hereby charge you with
making all necessary preparations in regard to organizational
and financial matters for bringing about a complete solution
of the Jewish question in the German sphere of influence in
Europe.” (<span class='it'>710-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In February or March 1943, according to Gottfried Boley, <span class='it'>Ministerialrat</span>
in the Reich Chancery, a conference on the solution of
the Jewish problem, attended by representatives of the ministries,
was called by Kaltenbrunner as Chief of the Security Police and
SD. Boley states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The meeting was presided over by Eichmann who had charge
of Jewish problems in the GESTAPO. In his opening remarks
Eichmann referred to former conferences that had
taken place in the office of the Chief of the Security Police and
SD, and that on this occasion he wished to discuss the matter
in a more basic manner. He stated that the Jewish question
had to be solved in a quick and proper way. Representatives
of the Chief of the Security Police and SD who attended the
conference made it clear to those present that the remaining
Jews had to be sent forcibly to concentration camps or be
sterilized. Those present at the conference must have carried
away the impression that the objectives were the extermination
of the Jewish people.” (<span class='it'>2645-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The deportation of Jews into concentration camps was part of
the program for slave labor. Jews not fit for work were screened
out at extermination centers, such as Auschwitz, and the remainder
were taken into concentration and work camps. The orders were
issued by Himmler and passed through the Chief of the Security
Police and SD, Kaltenbrunner (formerly Heydrich) to Mueller,
Chief of the GESTAPO, and then to Eichmann for execution.
(<span class='it'>2376-PS</span>; <span class='it'>1472-PS</span>.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Galicia, the deportation of Jews was carried out during the
period from April 1942 to June 1943. At the end of that time
Galicia had been entirely cleared of Jews. In all, 434,392 Jews
were deported from Galicia alone. In connection with the deportations,
Jewish property was confiscated, including furniture,
clothing, money, dental fillings, gold teeth, wedding rings, and
other personal property of all kinds. The Security Police participated
in this action along with other police and SS detachments.
(<span class='it'>L-18</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Warsaw the Security Police played a responsible role in the
<span class='pageno' title='298' id='Page_298'></span>
segregation of the Jews and placing them in the Ghetto, in the
subsequent removal of the Jews to concentration camps, and in
the final clearance of the Ghetto. The Ghetto was established in
November of 1940. Over 300,000 Jews were deported from it between
July and October 1942, and 6,500 more were deported in
January 1943. In April and May 1943 the final clearance of the
Ghetto was accomplished under the direction of the SS and Police
Leader of the Warsaw area, and with units of the SIPO,
Waffen SS, Order Police, and some military and Polish police
units. Thousands of Jews were killed in the action. About 7,000
were transported to “T. II” where they were exterminated. The
remaining 40,000 to 45,000 were placed in concentration camps.
(<span class='it'>1061-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Denmark the <span class='it'>Kommandeur</span> of the SIPO and SD was ordered
in September of 1943 to arrest all Danish citizens of Jewish belief
and send them to Stettin by ship and from there to the concentration
camp at Theresienstadt. In spite of the protests of the <span class='it'>Kommandeur</span>
of the SIPO and SD, Kaltenbrunner as Chief of the Security
Police and SD gave direct orders to carry out the anti-Jewish
action. Eichmann, head of the Jewish section in the GESTAPO,
had direct charge of the clearance program. (<span class='it'>2375-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Hungary the deportation of Jews was again carried out by
Eichmann. This action took place under direction of the GESTAPO
after the German occupation of Hungary in March 1944.
About 450,000 Jews were deported from Hungary due to the pressure
and direction of the GESTAPO. (<span class='it'>2605-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>The GESTAPO and the SD were primary agencies for the
persecution of the churches.</span> The fight against the churches was
never brought out into the open by the GESTAPO and the SD as
in the case of the persecution of the Jews. The struggle was designed
to weaken the churches and to lay a foundation for the
ultimate destruction of the confessional churches after the end
of the war. (<span class='it'>1815-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Section C2 of the SD dealt with education and religious life.
Section B1 of the GESTAPO dealt with political Catholicism.
Section B2 with political Protestantism sects, and Section B3 with
other churches and Freemasonry. (<span class='it'>L-185</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>As early as 1934 the GESTAPO enforced restrictions against
the churches. An order by the State Police of Dusseldorf prohibited
the churches from engaging in public activities, especially
public appearances in groups, sports, hikes, and the establishment
of holiday or outdoor camps. (<span class='it'>R-145</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1934 the Bavarian Political Police placed three ministers in
<span class='pageno' title='299' id='Page_299'></span>
protective custody for refusing to carry out the order of the Government
to ring church bells on the occasion of the death of Hindenburg.
(<span class='it'>1521-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The GESTAPO dissolved those church organizations which it
considered to have political objectives. In 1938 the GESTAPO at
Munich dissolved by order the Guild of the Virgin Mary of the
Bavarian dioceses. (<span class='it'>1481-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>An insight into the hidden objectives and secret methods of the
GESTAPO and the SD in the fight against the churches is disclosed
in the file of the GESTAPO regional office at Aachen
(<span class='it'>1815-PS</span>). On 12 May 1941 the Chief of the GESTAPO issued
a directive in which he reported that the Chief of the Security
Police and SD had issued an order under which the treatment of
church politics which had theretofore been divided between the SD
and the GESTAPO was to be taken over entirely by the GESTAPO.
The SD “church specialists” were to be temporarily transferred
to the same posts in the GESTAPO and operate an intelligence
service in the church political sphere there. SD files concerning
church political opposition were to be handed over to the GESTAPO,
but the SD was to retain material concerning the confessional
influence on the lives of the people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 22 and 23 September 1941 a conference of church specialists
attached to GESTAPO regional offices was held in the lecture hall
of the RSHA in Berlin. The notes on the speeches delivered at this
conference indicate that the GESTAPO considered the church as
an enemy to be attacked with determination and “true fanaticism.”
The immediate objective of the GESTAPO was stated to
be to insure that the Church did not win back any lost ground.
The ultimate objective was stated to be the destruction of the
confessional churches. This was to be brought about by the collection
of material through the GESTAPO church intelligence system
to be produced at a proper time as evidence for the charge of
treasonable activities during the German fight for existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The executive measures to be applied by the GESTAPO were
discussed. It was stated to be impractical to deal with political
offenses under normal legal procedure owing to lack of political
perception which prevailed among the legal authorities. The so-called
“agitator-Priests,” therefore, had to be handled by GESTAPO
measures, and when necessary removed to a concentration
camp. The following punishments were to be applied to priests
according to individual circumstances: warning, fine, forbidden
to preach, forbidden to remain in parish, forbidden all activity as
a priest, short-term arrest, protective custody. Retreats, youth
and recreational camps, evening services, processions and pilgrimages
<span class='pageno' title='300' id='Page_300'></span>
were all to be forbidden on grounds of interfering with
the war effort, blackouts, overburdened transportation, etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In executing this program close cooperation was required between
the GESTAPO and the SD. The study and treatment of
the Church in its opposition to the Nazi state was the responsibility
of the GESTAPO. The result of this treatment of the Church
in the sphere of “religious life” remained the province of the SD.
By these means the GESTAPO and the SD carried on the struggle
of the Nazi conspirators against the Church.</p>

<h3>H. <span class='it'>Conclusion.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>The evidence shows that the GESTAPO was created by Goering
in Prussia in April 1933 for the specific purpose of serving as a
police agency to strike down the actual and ideological enemies of
the Nazi regime, and that henceforward the GESTAPO in Prussia
and in the other States of the Reich carried out a program of terror
against all who were thought to be dangerous to the domination
of the conspirators over the people of Germany. Its methods were
utterly ruthless. It operated outside the law and sent its victims
to the concentration camps. The term “GESTAPO” became
the symbol of the Nazi regime of force and terror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Behind the scenes, operating secretly, the SD, through its vast
network of informants, spied upon the German people in their
daily lives, on the streets, in the shops, and even within the
sanctity of the churches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The most casual remark of a German citizen might bring him
before the GESTAPO, where his fate and freedom were decided
without recourse to law. In this government, in which the rule
of law was replaced by a tyrannical rule of men, the GESTAPO
was the primary instrumentality of oppression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The GESTAPO and the SD played an important part in almost
every criminal act of the conspiracy. The categories of these
crimes, apart from the thousands of specific instances of torture
and cruelty in policing Germany for the benefit of the conspirators,
indicate the extent of GESTAPO and SD complicity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The GESTAPO and SD fabricated the border incidents which
Hitler used as an excuse for attacking Poland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through the <span class='it'>Einsatz</span> Groups they murdered approximately
2,000,000 defenseless men, women, and children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They removed Jews, political leaders, and scientists from prisoner
of war camps and murdered them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They took recaptured prisoners of war to concentration camps
and murdered some of them.
<span class='pageno' title='301' id='Page_301'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The GESTAPO established and classified concentration camps
and sent millions of people into them for extermination and slave
labor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The GESTAPO cleared Europe of the Jews and was responsible
for sending 4,000,000 Jews to their deaths in annihilation camps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The GESTAPO and SD rounded up hundreds of thousands of
citizens of occupied countries and shipped them to Germany for
forced labor, and sent slave laborers to labor reformatory camps
and concentration camps for disciplining.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They executed captured commandos and paratroopers and protected
civilians who lynched Allied flyers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They took civilians of occupied countries to Germany for secret
trial and punishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They arrested, tried, and punished citizens of occupied territories
under special criminal procedures which did not accord them
fair trials, and by summary methods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They murdered or sent to concentration camps the relatives of
persons who had allegedly committed crimes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They ordered the murder of prisoners in SIPO and SD prisons
to prevent their release by the Allied armies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They participated in the seizure and spoliation of public and
private property.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were primary agencies for the persecution of the Jews
and of the churches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In carrying out these crimes the GESTAPO operated as an organization,
closely centralized and controlled from Berlin headquarters.
Reports were submitted to Berlin, and all important
decisions emanated from Berlin. The regional offices had only
limited power to commit persons to concentration camps. All cases,
other than those of short duration, had to be submitted to Berlin
for approval. From 1943 to the end of the war the defendant Kaltenbrunner
was the Chief of the Security Police and SD in Berlin.
The GESTAPO was organized on a functional basis. Its principal
divisions dealt with the groups and institutions against which it
committed the worst crimes—Jews, churches, communists, and
political liberals. Thus, in perpetrating these crimes, the GESTAPO
acted as an entity, each section performing its part in the
general criminal enterprises ordered by Berlin. It must be held
responsible as an entity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The SD was at all times a department of the SS. Its criminality
directly concerns and contributes to the criminality of the SS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to the GESTAPO, it is submitted that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<div class='blockquote-right95percent'>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>1.</span><p class='listPara'>The GESTAPO is an organization, in the sense in which

</div>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>2.</span><p class='listPara'>The defendants Goering and Kaltenbrunner committed
the crimes defined in Article 6 of the Charter in their
capacity as members and leaders of the GESTAPO.</p>
</div>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>3.</span><p class='listPara'>The GESTAPO, as an organization, participated in and
aided the conspiracy which contemplated and involved
the commission of the crimes defined in Article 6 of the
Charter.</p>
</div>

</div>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In 1941, on German Police Day, Heydrich, the former Chief of
the Security Police and the SD, said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Secret State Police, Criminal Police, and SD are still adorned
with the furtive and whispered secrecy of a political detective
story. In a mixture of fear and shuddering—and yet at
home with a certain feeling of security because of their presence,—brutality,
inhumanity bordering on the sadistic, and
ruthlessness are attributed abroad to the men of this profession.”
(Extract from a brochure on Reinhard Heydrich,
published in December 1943.)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The evidence as it is submitted, shows that brutality, inhumanity,
sadism, and ruthlessness were characteristic of the GESTAPO
and that it was and should be declared, a criminal organization, in
accordance with article 9 of the Charter.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg316a'>7. THE GENERAL STAFF AND HIGH COMMAND OF THE ARMED FORCES</h2>

<p class='pindent'>In one respect the General Staff and High Command of the
German Armed Forces is to be distinguished from the other groups
and organizations against which the prosecution seeks declaration
of criminality. The Leadership Corps of the NSDAP, for example,
was the instrument by which Hitlerism rose to full power in
Germany. The SA and the SS were branches—large branches to
be sure—of the Nazi Party. The German police had certain roots
and antecedents which antedated Hitlerism, but was almost entirely
a creature of the party and the SS. The Reichs Cabinet was,
in essence, merely a committee or set of committees of Reichs Ministers,
and when the Nazis came to power these ministerial positions
were filled for the most part by Nazis. All those groups and
organizations, accordingly, either owe their origin and development
to Naziism, or automatically became nazified when Hitler
came to full power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is not true of this group, the General Staff and High Command
of the German Armed Forces. It is common knowledge that
German armed might and the German military tradition antedate
Hitlerism by many decades. The war of 1914-18, the Kaiser, and
the “scrap of paper” are modern witnesses to this fact.
<span class='pageno' title='317' id='Page_317'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>As a result of the German defeat in 1918 and the Treaty of
Versailles, the size and activities of the German armed forces
were severely restricted. The last few years have made it abundantly
apparent that these restrictions did not destroy or even
seriously undermine German militarism. The full flowering of
German military strength came about through collaboration between
the Nazis and the career leaders of the German Armed
Forces—the professional soldiers, sailors, and airmen. When Hitler
came to power in 1933, he did not find a vacuum in the field
of military affairs; he found a small <span class='it'>Reichswehr</span> and a body of
professional officers with a morale and outlook nourished by German
military history.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The leaders of these professional officers constitute the group
named in the Indictment—the General Staff and High Command
of the German Armed Forces. This part of the case concerns that
group of men. Needless to say, it is not the prosecution’s position
that it is a crime to be a soldier or sailor, or to serve one’s country
as a soldier or sailor in time of war. The profession of arms is
an honorable one, and can be honorably practiced. But it is too
clear for argument that a man who commits crimes cannot plead
as a defense that he committed them in uniform.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not in the nature of things, and it is not the prosecution’s
position, that all members of this group were wicked men, or that
they were all equally culpable. But this group not only collaborated
with Hitler and supported many Nazi objectives. They furnished
one thing which was essential and basic to the success of
the Nazi program for Germany—skill and experience in the development
and use of armed might.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why did this group support Hitler and the Nazis? The answer
is simple. The answer is that they agreed with the basic objectives
of Naziism, and that Hitler gave the generals the opportunity
to play a major part in achieving those objectives. The generals,
like Hitler, wanted Germany to aggrandize at the expense
of neighboring countries, and to do so if necessary by force or
threat of force. Force—armed might—was the keystone of the
arch, the thing without which nothing else would have been
possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they came to power and when they had attained power, the
Nazis had two alternatives: to collaborate with and expand the
<span class='it'>Reichswehr</span>, or to ignore the Reichswehr and build up a separate
army of their own. The generals feared that the Nazis might do
the latter. So they were the more ready to play along with the
Nazis. Moreover, the Nazis offered the generals the chance of
achieving much that the generals wished to achieve in the expansion
<span class='pageno' title='318' id='Page_318'></span>
of German armies and frontiers. And so the generals climbed
onto the Nazi bandwagon. They saw it was going in their direction
for the present. No doubt they hoped later to take over the
direction themselves. In fact, it was ultimately they who were
taken over by the Nazis. Hitler attracted the generals to him
with the glitter of conquest and then succeeded in submerging
them politically. As the war proceeded they became his tools.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if the leaders of the Armed Forces became the tools of Naziism,
it is not to be supposed that they were unwitting, or that they
did not participate fully in many of the actions which are charged
as criminal. The willingness, indeed eagerness, of German officers
to become partners of the Nazis will be fully developed.</p>

<h3>A. <span class='it'>Composition and Functions of The General Staff and High Command Group.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>During the first World War there was an organization in the
German Armed Forces known as the Great General Staff. This
name persists in the public mind, but the <span class='it'>Grosse Generalstab</span> no
longer exists in fact. There has been no such single organization,
no single German General Staff, since 1918. But there has of course
been a group of men responsible for the policy and acts of the
Armed Forces. The fact that these men have no collective name
does not prevent us from collecting them together. Men cannot
escape the consequences of their collective acts by combining informally
instead of formally. The essence of a general staff or a
high command lies not in name but in function. And the men comprised
within this group do constitute a functional group, welded
together by common responsibility, of those officers who had the
principal authority and responsibility under Hitler, for the plans
and operations of the German armed forces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Structure and Organization of the German Armed Forces.</span>
When the Nazis came to power in 1933 the German Armed Forces
were controlled by a Reich Defense Minister, at that time Field
Marshall von Blomberg. Subordinate to von Blomberg were the
chiefs of the army staff (at that time von Fritsch), and of the
naval staff, the defendant Raeder. Owing to the limitations imposed
on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles, the German Air
Force at that time had no official existence whatsoever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In May 1935, at the time that military conscription was introduced
in Germany, there was a change in the titles of these offices
but the structure remained basically the same. Field Marshall von
Blomberg remained in supreme command of the armed forces, with
the title of Reich Minister for War and Commander-in-Chief of
<span class='pageno' title='319' id='Page_319'></span>
the Armed Forces. Von Fritsch became Commander-in-Chief of
the Army, and Raeder Commander-in-Chief of the Navy. The
army and naval staffs were renamed “High Commands”—<span class='it'>Oberkommando
des Heeres and Oberkommando der Kriegsmarine</span>,
from which are derived the initials by which they are usually
known (OKH and OKM).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German Air Force came into official and open existence at
about this same time, but it was not put under von Blomberg. It
was an independent institution under the personal command of
Goering, who had the double title of Air Minister and Commander-in-Chief
of the Air Force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In February 1938 a rather fundamental reorganization took
place, both in terms of personnel and organizational structure. Although
Raeder survived the reshuffle, von Blomberg and von
Fritsch were both retired from their positions, and Blomberg’s
ministry, the War Ministry, was wound up. This ministry had
contained a division or department called the <span class='it'>Wehrmachtamt</span> or
“Armed Forces Department,” the function of which was to coordinate
the plans and operations of the Army and Navy. From this
Armed Forces Department was formed a new over-all Armed
Forces authority, known as the High Command of the Armed
Forces—<span class='it'>Oberkommando der Wehrmacht</span>—usually known by the
initials OKW. As the Air Force as well as the Army and the
Navy was subordinated to OKW, coordination of all Armed Forces
matters was vested in the OKW, which was in effect Hitler’s personal
staff for these matters. It combined staff and ministerial
functions. Keitel was appointed chief of the OKW. The most important
department of OKW was the operations staff, of which
Jodl became the chief. Jodl’s immediate subordinate was Warlimont,
with the title of Deputy Chief of The Armed Forces Operations
Staff from 1941. (The genesis of this department is explained
in <span class='it'>L-79</span>.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>This reorganization and establishment of OKW were embodied
in a decree issued by Hitler on 4 February 1938 (1938 RGBl.,
Part I, page 111):</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under OKW were the supreme commands of the three branches
of the Armed Forces: OKH, OKM, and the Air Force, which did
not receive the official designation of <span class='it'>Oberkommando der Luftwaffe</span>
(OKL) until 1944. Raeder remained after 1938 as Commander-in-Chief
of the Navy, and von Fritsch was replaced by
von Brauchitsch as Commander-in-Chief of the Army. Goering
continued as Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force. In 1941 von
Brauchitsch was replaced as Commander-in-Chief of the Army by
Hitler himself, and Raeder was replaced as Commander-in-Chief
of the Navy by Doenitz early in 1943. Goering continued as Commander-in-Chief
of the Air Force until the last month of the war,
when he was replaced by von Greim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>OKW, OKH, OKM and the Air Force each had its own staff.
These four staffs did not have uniform designations; in the case
of OKH, the staff was known as the <span class='it'>Generalstab</span> (General Staff);
in the case of OKW, it was known as the <span class='it'>Fuehrungstab</span> (Operations
Staff); but in all cases the functions were those of a General
Staff in military parlance. It will be seen, therefore, that there
was in this war no single German General Staff, but rather four,
one for each branch of the service plus one for the OKW as the
over-all interservice supreme command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under OKH, OKL, and OKM were the various fighting formations
of the Army, Air Force and Navy respectively. The largest
army field formation was known to the Germans, as it is among
the nations generally, as an “army group”. An Army group was
a headquarters controlling two or more “armies.” In some cases,
<span class='pageno' title='321' id='Page_321'></span>
e.g. in the campaigns in Norway and Greece where only one army
was used, “armies” were directly subordinated to OKH, rather
than to an “army group.” Under the armies come the lower field
formations such as corps, divisions, regiments, etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the case of the German Air Force (OKL), the largest formation
was known as an “air fleet” (<span class='it'>Luftflotte</span>) and the lower
units under the air fleet were called “corps” (<span class='it'>Fliegerkorps</span> or
<span class='it'>Jagdkorps</span>) or “divisions” (<span class='it'>Fliegerdivisionen</span> or <span class='it'>Jagddivisionen</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under OKM were the various “naval group commands,” which
controlled all naval operations in a given area, with the exception
of the operation of the high seas fleet and the submarines, which
by their nature, were too mobile to be restricted to an area command.
The Commanders of the fleet and submarines, and certain
other specialized units, were directly subordinate to the German
Admiralty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Composition of the Group Charged as Criminal.</span> The
group charged in the Indictment (Appendix B) as criminal
comprises, first, German officers who held the top positions in
the four supreme commands described above; and second, the
officers who held the top field commands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The holders of nine of the principal positions in the supreme
commands are included in the group. Four of these are positions
of supreme authority: the chief of the OKW, the Commander-in-Chief
of the Army, the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, and the
Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force. Four other positions are
those of the Chiefs of Staff to the four Commanders-in-Chief: the
Chief of the Operations Staff of OKW, the Chief of the General
Staff of the Army, the Chief of the General Staff of the Air Force,
and the Chief of the Naval War Staff. The ninth position is that
of Deputy Chief of the Operations Staff of OKW. The particular
responsibility of the holder of this office was planning, and for
this reason his office has been included in the group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The group named in the Indictment comprises all individuals
who held any of these nine staff positions between February 1938
and the end of the war in May 1945. February 1938 was selected
as the opening date because it was in that month that the top organization
of the German Armed Forces was reorganized and
assumed substantially the form in which it persisted up to the
end of the war. Twenty-two different individuals occupied these
nine positions during that period, of whom eighteen are still living.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With regard to the officers who held the principal field commands,
the Indictment includes as members of the group all Commanders-in-Chief
in the field who had the status of <span class='it'>Oberbefehlshaber</span>
<span class='pageno' title='322' id='Page_322'></span>
in the Army, Navy, or Air Force. The term <span class='it'>Oberbefehlshaber</span>
defies literal translation into English: literally the components
of the word mean “over-command-holder,” and it is perhaps best
translated as Commander-in-Chief. In the case of the Army, commanders
of army groups and armies always had the status and
title of <span class='it'>Oberbefehlshaber</span>. In the Air Force, the Commander-in-Chief
of air fleets always had the status of <span class='it'>Oberbefehlshaber</span>, although
they were not formally so designated until 1944. In the
Navy, officers holding the senior regional commands, and therefore
in control of all naval operations (other than of the high seas
fleet itself) in a given sector, had the status of <span class='it'>Oberbefehlshaber</span>.
Roughly 110 individual officers had the status of <span class='it'>Oberbefehlshaber</span>
in the Army, Navy, or Air Force during the period in question,
and all but approximately a dozen of them are still alive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The entire General Staff and High Command group as defined
in the Indictment comprises about 130 officers, of whom 114 are
believed still to be living. These figures are the cumulative total
of all officers who at any time belonged to the group during the
seven years and three months from February 1938 to May 1945.
The number of active members of the group at any one time is,
of course, much smaller; it rose from about 20 at the outbreak
of the war to 50 in 1944 and 1945.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The structure and functioning of the German General Staff and
High Command group have been described in a series of affidavits
by some of the principal German field marshalls and generals.
A brief description of how these statements were obtained may be
helpful. In the first place two American officers, selected for ability
and experience in interrogating high-ranking German prisoners
of war, were briefed by an Intelligence officer and a trial counsel
on the particular problems presented by this part of the case.
These interrogators were already well versed in military intelligence
and were able to converse fluently in German. The officer
who briefed these interrogators emphasized that their function
was objectively to inquire into and to establish facts on which the
prosecution wishes to be accurately and surely informed; the interrogators
were not to regard themselves as cross-examiners. The
German officers to be interrogated were selected on the basis of the
special knowledge which they could be presumed to possess by
reason of positions held by them during the past generation. After
each interview the interrogator prepared a report. From this report
such facts as appeared relevant to the issues now before the
Tribunal were extracted and a statement embodying these facts
was prepared. This statement was then presented to the officer
at a later interview. It was presented in the form of a draft and
<span class='pageno' title='323' id='Page_323'></span>
the officer was asked whether it truly reproduced what he said
at the previous interview. He was also invited to alter it in any
way he thought fit. This careful and laborious, but necessary,
process had as its object the procuring of the best possible testimony
in the form of carefully considered statements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These affidavits fully support the prosecution’s description of
the group, and conclusively establish that this group of officers
was in fact the group which had the major responsibility for
planning and directing the operations of the German Armed
Forces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first of these affidavits is that of Franz Halder (<span class='it'>3702-PS</span>),
who held the rank of <span class='it'>Generaloberst</span> (Colonel General), the equivalent
of a four-star general in the American Army. Halder was
chief of the General Staff of OKH from September 1938 to September
1942 and is, accordingly, a member of the group. His statement
reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Ultimate authority and responsibility for military affairs in
Germany was vested in the Head of State who prior to 2
August 1934 was Field Marshall von Hindenburg and thereafter
until 1945 was Adolf Hitler.</p>

<p>“Specialized military matters were the responsibility of the
three branches of the Armed Forces subordinate to the Commander-in-Chief
of the Armed Forces (at the same time Head
of State), that is to say the Army, the Navy and the Air
Force. In practice, supervision within this field was exercised
by a relatively small group of high-ranking officers. These
officers exercised such supervision in their official capacity and
by virtue of their training, their positions and their mutual
contacts. Plans for military operations of the German Armed
Forces were prepared by members of this group according to
the instructions of the OKW in the name of their respective
Commanding Officers and were presented by them to the Commander-in-Chief
of the Armed Forces (at the same time Head
of State).</p>

<p>“The members of this group were charged with the responsibility
of preparing for military operations within their competent
fields and they actually did prepare for any such operations
as were to be undertaken by troops in the field.</p>

<p>“Prior to any operation, members of this group were assembled
and given appropriate directions by the Head of State.
Examples of such meetings are the speech by Hitler to the
Commanders-in-Chief on 22 August 1939 prior to the Polish
campaign and the consultation at the Reich Chancellery on
14 June 1941 prior to the first Russian campaign. The composition
<span class='pageno' title='324' id='Page_324'></span>
of this group and the relationship of its members to
each other were as shown in the attached chart. This was in
effect the General Staff and High Command of the German
Armed Forces.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“(S)&nbsp;&nbsp;Halder”&nbsp;&nbsp;(<span class='it'>3702-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A substantially identical statement (<span class='it'>3703-PS</span>) was made by von
Brauchitsch, who held the rank of Field Marshall, and who was
Commander-in-Chief of the Army from 1938 to 1941. Von
Brauchitsch was also, therefore, a member of the group. The only
difference between the two statements is worth noting occurs in
the last sentence of each. Halder states that the group described
in the Indictment “was in effect the General Staff and High Command
of the German Armed Forces,” (<span class='it'>3702-PS</span>), whereas von
Brauchitsch puts it a little differently, saying “in the hands of
those who filled the positions shown in the chart lay the actual
direction of the Armed Forces.” (<span class='it'>3703-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both von Brauchitsch and Halder have stated under oath that
the General Staff chart (<span class='it'>Chart Number 7</span>) accurately portrays
the top organization of the German Armed Forces. The statements
by von Brauchitsch and Halder also fully support the prosecution’s
statement that the holders of the positions shown on this chart
constitute the group in whom lay the major responsibility for the
planning and execution of all Armed Forces matters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another affidavit by Halder (<span class='it'>3707-PS</span>) sets forth certain less
important matters of detail:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The most important department in the OKW was the Operations
Staff—in much the same way as the General Staff
was in the Army and Air Force and the Naval War Staff in
the Navy. Under Keitel there were a number of departmental
chiefs who were equal in status with Jodl, but in the planning
and conduct of military affairs they and their departments
were less important and less influential than Jodl and Jodl’s
staff.</p>

<p>“The OKW Operations Staff was also divided into sections.
Of these the most important was the section of which Warlimont
was chief. It was called the ‘National Defense’ Section
and was primarily concerned with the development of strategic
questions. From 1941 onwards Warlimont, though charged
with the same duties, was known as Deputy Chief of the OKW
Operations Staff.</p>

<p>“There was during World War II no unified General Staff
such as the Great General Staff which operated in World
War I.</p>

<p>“Operational matters for the Army and Air Force were
<span class='pageno' title='325' id='Page_325'></span>
worked out by the group of high-ranking officers described
in my Statement of 7 November (in the Army: ‘General Staff
of the Army’; in the Air Force ‘General Staff of the Air
Force’).</p>

<p>“Operational matters in the Navy were even in World War I
not worked out by the ‘Great General Staff’ but by the Naval
Staff.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“(Signed)&nbsp;&nbsp;Franz Halder”&nbsp;&nbsp;(<span class='it'>3707-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This affidavit is primarily concerned with the functions of the
General Staffs of the four Commanders of OKW, OKL, OKM, and
OKH and fully supports the inclusion of the Chiefs of Staff of the
four services in the indicted group, as well as the inclusion of
Warlimont as Deputy Chief of the OKW Operations Staff, with
his strategic planning responsibilities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An affidavit (<span class='it'>3708-PS</span>) by the son of Field Marshal von Brauchitsch,
who had the rank of <span class='it'>Oberst</span> (Colonel) in the German Air
Force, and who was personal aide to Goering as Commander-in-Chief
of the German Air Force, furnishes a few details on the
<span class='it'>Luftwaffe</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“<span class='it'>Luftflottenchefs</span> have the same status as the <span class='it'>Oberbefehlshaber</span>
of an army. During the war they had no territorial
authority and accordingly exercised no territorial jurisdiction.</p>

<p>“They were the highest troop commanders of the air force
units subordinate to them and were directly under the command
of the Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force.</p>

<p>“Until the summer of 1944 they bore the designation ‘<span class='it'>Befehlshaber</span>’
and from then on that of ‘<span class='it'>Oberbefehlshaber</span>.’ This
change of designation carried with it no change in the functions
and responsibilities which they previously had.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“(Signed)&nbsp;&nbsp;Brauchitsch”&nbsp;&nbsp;(<span class='it'>3708-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Functioning of the General Staff and High Command
Group.</span> In many respects, the German military leaders functioned
in the same general manner as obtains in the military establishments
of other large nations. General plans were made by the
top staff officers and their assistants at OKW, OKH, OKL, and
OKM, in collaboration with the field generals or admirals who
were entrusted with the execution of the plans. A decision to
wage a particular campaign would be made, needless to say, at
the highest level, and the making of such a decision would involve
political and diplomatic questions as well as purely military considerations.
When the decision was made, to attack Poland, for
example, the top staff officers in Berlin and their assistants would
<span class='pageno' title='326' id='Page_326'></span>
work out general military plans for the campaign. These general
plans would be transmitted to the Commanders of the Army groups
and Armies who were to be in charge of the campaign. Consultation
would follow between the top field commanders and the top
staff officers at OKW and OKH, and the plans would be revised,
perfected, and refined in detail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The manner in which the group worked, involving as it did the
interchange of ideas and recommendations between the top staff
officers at OKW and OKH and the principal field commanders, is
graphically described in two affidavits by Field Marshall von
Brauchitsch (<span class='it'>3705-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>“STATEMENT OF 7 NOVEMBER 1945</p>

<p>“In April 1939 I was instructed by Hitler to start military
preparations for a possible campaign against Poland. Work
was immediately begun to prepare an operational and deployment
plan. This was then presented to Hitler and approved
by him as amended by a change which he desired.</p>

<p>“After the operational and deployment orders had been given
to the two Commanders of the army groups and the five
Commanders of the armies, conferences took place with them
about details in order to hear their desires and recommendations.</p>

<p>“After the outbreak of the war I continued this policy of
keeping in close and constant touch with the Commanders-in-Chief
of army groups and of armies by personal visits to
their headquarters as well as by telephone, teletype or wireless.
In this way I was able to obtain their advice and their
recommendations during the conduct of military operations.
In fact it was the accepted policy and common practice for
the Commander-in-Chief of the Army to consult his subordinate
Commanders-in-Chief and to maintain a constant exchange
of ideas with them. The Commander-in-Chief of the
Army and his Chief of Staff communicated with army groups
and, thru them as well as directly, with armies; thru army
groups on strategical and tactical matters; directly on questions
affecting supply and the administration of conquered
territory occupied by these armies. An army group had no
territorial jurisdiction. It had a relatively small staff which
was concerned only with military operations. In all territorial
matters it was the Commander-in-Chief of the army
and not of the army group who exercised jurisdiction.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>“SUPPLEMENT TO MY STATEMENT OF 7 NOVEMBER 1945</p>

<p>“When Hitler had made a decision to support the realization
of his political objectives through military pressure or
through the application of military force, the Commander-in-Chief
of the Army, if he was at all involved, ordinarily
first received an appropriate oral briefing or an appropriate
oral command.</p>

<p>“Operational and deployment plans were next worked out
in the OKM. After these plans had been presented to Hitler,
generally by word of mouth, and had been approved by him,
there followed a written order from the OKW to the three
branches of the Armed Forces. In the meanwhile the OKH
began to transmit the operational and deployment plans to
the army groups and armies involved. Details of the operational
and deployment plans were discussed by the OKH with
the Commanders of the army groups and armies and with
the Chiefs of Staff of these Commanders.</p>

<p>“During the operations the OKH maintained a constant exchange
of ideas with the army groups by means of telephone,
radio and courier. The Commander-in-Chief of the Army
used every opportunity to maintain a personal exchange of
ideas with the Commanders of army groups, armies and
lower echelons by means of personal visits to them. In the
war against Russia the Commanders of army groups and of
armies were individually and repeatedly called in by Hitler
for consultation.</p>

<p>“Orders for all operational matters went from the OKH to
army groups and for all matters concerning supply and territorial
jurisdiction from the OKH directly to the armies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Oberbefehlshaber</span> in the field, therefore—and in the case
of the army that means the Commander-in-Chief of army groups
and armies—participated in planning, and directed the execution
of the plans. The <span class='it'>Oberbefehlshaber</span> were also the repositories of
general executive power in the areas in which their army groups
and armies were operating. This fact appears from a directive
of 13 March 1941 signed by Keitel and issued by the Supreme
Command of the Armed Forces (<span class='it'>447-PS</span>). This directive sets out
various regulations for the impending operations against the Soviet
Union (which were actually begun on 22 June 1941). Under paragraph
I, is entitled “Area of operations and executive power (<span class='it'>Vollziehende
Gewalt</span>)”, subparagraph 1 and 2(a) provide:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“It is not contemplated to declare East Prussia and the General-Gouvernement
<span class='pageno' title='328' id='Page_328'></span>

with the unpublished Fuehrer orders from 19 and
21 October 1939, the Commander in Chief of the Army shall
be authorized to take all measures necessary for the execution
of his military aim and for the safeguarding of the troops.
He may transfer his authority onto the Commanders in Chief

<p class='pindent'>The official command invitation to participate in consultations
at the Reich Chancellery on 14 June 1941, eight days prior to the
German attack on the Soviet Union, also shows the group at work
(<span class='it'>C-78</span>). This meeting is referred to in the last paragraph of the
affidavits by Halder (<span class='it'>3702-PS</span>) and von Brauchitsch (<span class='it'>3703-PS</span>)
mentioned above. This document, signed by Colonel Schmundt,
Chief <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> Adjutant to Hitler, and is dated at Berchtesgaden,
9 June 1941, begins:</p>

<p>“The Fuehrer and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces
has ordered reports on Barbarossa [the code name for the invasion
of the U.S.S.R.] by the Commanders of Army Groups
and Armies and Naval and Air Commanders of equal rank.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This document likewise includes a list of the participants in this
conference which closely parallels the structure of the group as set
forth in the Indictment. The list includes General Field Marshal
von Brauchitsch, who was then Commander-in-Chief of the Army,
and a member of the group; and General Halder, who was chief
of the Army Staff, and a member of the group. Then there are
three subordinates who were not members of the group: Paulus,
Heusinger, and Gyldenfeldt. Next is navy Captain Wagner, who
was chief of the Operations Staff, Operations Division of the Naval
War Staff, not a member of the group. On the air side there were
General Milch, State Secretary and Inspector of the Air Force,
again not a member of the group; General Joschonnek, chief of
the General Staff of the Air Force and a member of the group;
<span class='pageno' title='329' id='Page_329'></span>
and two of his assistants. Passing to the OKW, High Command
of the Armed Forces, we find that Keitel, Jodl, Warlimont, all
members of the group, were present, with an assistant from the
General Staff. Then there were four officers from the office of the
adjutant, who were not members of the group. Present from the
Field Commanders were General von Falkenhorst, Army High
Command, Norway, member of the group; General Stumpff, Air
Fleet 5, member of the group; Rundstedt, Reichenau, Stuelpnagel,
Schobert, Kleist, all from the Army, all members of the group.
Of the Air Force officers present, General Loehr, Air Fleet 4, was
a member of the group; General Fromm and General Udet were
not members. One was director of the Home Forces, commander of
the Home Forces, and the other the Director General of Equipment
and Supply. Turning to the Navy, those present were
Raeder, a member of the group; Fricke, chief of the Naval War
Staff, and a member of the group; and an assistant who was not
a member, Carls, Navy Group North, member of the group, and
likewise Schmundt were present. Then from the Army, Leeb,
Busch, Kuechler, all members of the group as <span class='it'>Oberbefehlshaber</span>,
and Keller, a member of the group, were present. Also Bock, Kluge,
Strauss, Guderian, Hoth, Kesselring, all members of the group,
were present. It will be seen that, except for a few assisting officers
of relatively junior rank, all the participants in these consultations
were members of the group, and that in fact the participants
in these consultations included the members of the group
who were concerned in the impending operations against the Soviet
Union.</p>

<h3>B. <span class='it'>Criminal Activities of the General Staff and High Command Group.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>The General Staff and High Command group is well represented
among the individual defendants in this case. It must be kept in
mind that this group may be declared criminal in connection with
any act of which an individual defendant who is a member of the
group may be convicted (Charter, Article 9). Five of the individual
defendants, or one-quarter of the total number accused,
are members of this group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the order of listing in the indictments, the first is Goering.
Goering is a defendant in this case in numerous capacities. He
is a member of the General Staff and High Command group by
reason of having been the Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force
from the time when the Air Force first came into the open, and
was officially established, until about a month prior to the end of
the war. During the last month of the war he was replaced in
<span class='pageno' title='330' id='Page_330'></span>
this capacity by von Greim, who committed suicide shortly after
his capture at the end of the war. Goering is charged with crimes
under all counts of the Indictment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next listed defendant who is a member of the group is Keitel.
He and the remaining three defendants who are members of the
group are all four in this case primarily or solely in their military
capacities, and all four of them were professional soldiers or
sailors. Keitel was made the chief of the High Command of the
German Armed Forces (OKW) when the OKW was first set up
in 1938, and remained in that capacity throughout the period in
question. He held the rank of Field Marshall throughout most of
this period, and in addition to being the Chief of OKW, he was
a member of the Secret Cabinet Council and of the Council of
Ministers for the Defense of the Reich. Keitel is charged with
crimes under all four counts of the Indictment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The defendant Jodl was a career soldier; he was an <span class='it'>Oberstleutnant</span>
(Lieutenant Colonel) when the Nazis came to power, and
ultimately attained the rank of <span class='it'>Generaloberst</span> (Colonel General).
He became the Chief of the Operations Staff of the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>,
and continued in that capacity throughout the war. He also is
charged with crimes under all four counts of the Indictment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The defendant Raeder is in a sense the senior member of the
entire group, having been Commander-in-Chief of the German
Navy as early as 1928. He attained the highest rank in the German
Navy, <span class='it'>Grossadmiral</span>, and in addition to being Commander-in-Chief
of the Navy he was a member of the Secret Cabinet Council.
He retired from Supreme Command of the Navy in January
1943, and was replaced by Doenitz. Raeder is charged with crimes
under counts 1, 2, and 3 of the Indictment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last of these five defendants, Doenitz, was a relatively junior
officer when the Nazis came to power. During the early years of
the Nazi regime he specialized in submarine activities and was
in command of the U-boat arm when the war broke out. He rose
steadily in the Navy and was chosen to succeed Raeder when the
latter retired in 1943. Doenitz then became Commander-in-Chief
of the Navy and attained the rank of <span class='it'>Grossadmiral</span>. When the
German Armed Forces collapsed near the end of the war, Doenitz
succeeded Hitler as head of the German government. He is charged
with crimes under counts 1, 2, and 3 of the Indictment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Four of these five defendants are reasonably typical of the
group as a whole. Goering is an exception: he is primarily a Nazi
party politician nourishing a hobby for aviation as a result of his
career in 1914-18. But the others made soldiering or sailoring their
life work. They collaborated with and joined in the most important
<span class='pageno' title='331' id='Page_331'></span>
adventures of the Nazis, but they were not among the early party
members. They differ in no essential respect from the other
125 odd members of the group. They are, no doubt, abler men in
certain respects than some of the other members, as they rose
to the highest positions in the German Armed Forces, and all but
Jodl attained the highest rank. But they are generally representative
of the group, and their expressed ideas and actions are fairly
characteristic of those of the other group members.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not, of course, the prosecution’s position, and it is not essential
to its case, that all 130 members of this group, (or all the
members of any other organization or group named in the Indictment),
actually committed crimes, under Article 6 of the Charter.
It is the prosecution’s position that the leadership of the group and
the purposes to which the group was committed by the leaders were
criminal under Article 6. The individual defendants were among
the leaders of the General Staff and High Command group, and,
acting in the official capacities which made them members of the
group, they performed and participated in acts which are criminal
under Article 6 of the Charter. Other members of the group performed
such acts. The German Armed Forces were so completely
under the group’s control as to make the group responsible for
their activities under the last sentence of Article 6 of the Charter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>The Planning and Launching of Wars of Aggression.</span> It is,
of course, the normal function of a military staff to prepare military
plans. In peacetime, military staffs customarily concern themselves
with the preparation of plans of attack or defense based on
hypothetical contingencies. There is nothing criminal about carrying
on such exercises or preparing such plans. That is not what
these defendants and this group are charged with.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This group agreed with the Nazi objective of aggrandizing Germany
by force or threat of force. They joined knowingly and enthusiastically
in developing German armed might for this criminal
purpose. They joined knowingly and willfully in initiating and
waging aggressive wars. They were advised in advance of the
Nazi plans to launch aggressive wars. They laid the military plans
and directed the initiation and carrying on of the wars. These
things are criminal under article 6 of the Charter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aggressive war cannot be prepared and waged without intense
activity on the part of all branches of the Armed Forces and particularly
by the high-ranking officers who control such forces. To
the extent, therefore, that German preparations for and waging
of aggressive war are historical facts of common knowledge, or
are proved, it necessarily follows that the General Staff and High
<span class='pageno' title='332' id='Page_332'></span>
Command group, and the German Armed Forces, participated
therein.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is so notwithstanding the effort on the part of certain military
leaders of Germany, after defeat, to insist that until the
troops marched they lived in an ivory tower of military technicalities,
unable or unwilling to observe the end to which their work
led. The documentary evidence which follows fully refutes any
such contentions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The purposes and objectives of the German General Staff and
High Command group during the period prior to the absorption
of Austria may be summarized as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>(i) Secret rearmament, including the training of military
personnel, the production of war munitions, and the building
of an air force;</p>

<p>(ii) The creation of a military air force, announced by
Goering on 10 March 1935;</p>

<p>(iii) The law for compulsory military service, of 16 March
1935, fixing the peace-time strength of the German Army
at 500,000; and</p>

<p>(iv) The reoccupation of the Rhineland on 7 March 1936
and the refortification of that area.</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>These events are historical facts not requiring proof. Likewise,
the impossibility of the Nazis’ achieving these ends without cooperation
by the Armed Forces is indisputable from the very nature
of things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Events and circumstances during the period 1933-36 are discussed
in Section 2 of Chapter IX. Chief among these were the
secret expansion of the German Navy in violation of treaty limitations,
under the guidance of Raeder; the secret Reich Defense
Law of 21 May 1935, adopted the same day that Germany unilaterally
renounced the armament provision of the Versailles Treaty
(<span class='it'>2261-PS</span>); von Blomberg’s plan, 2 May 1935, for the reoccupation
of the Rhineland (<span class='it'>C-139</span>); and von Blomberg’s orders of 2 March
1936 under which the reoccupation was actually carried out (<span class='it'>C-159</span>).
All these events clearly required the closest collaboration between
the military leaders and the Nazis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The state of mind and objectives of the German military leaders
during this early period are significant. The viewpoint of the
German Navy on the opportunities which Naziism offered for rearmament
so that Germany could achieve its objectives by force
or threat of force, is reflected in a memorandum published by the
High Command of the German Navy in 1937 entitled “The Fight
of the Navy against Versailles, 1919-35” (<span class='it'>C-156</span>). This memorandum
was compiled by a naval captain named Schuessler in the
<span class='pageno' title='333' id='Page_333'></span>
German Admiralty. The preface contains the following statements:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The object and aim of this memorandum is to draw a technically
reliable picture based on documentary records and
the evidence of those who took part, of the fight of the Navy
against the unbearable regulations of the Peace Treaty of
Versailles.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“This compilation makes it clearer however, that even such
ideal and ambitious plans can be realized only to a small degree
if the concentrated and united strength of the whole
people is not behind the courageous activity of the soldier.
Only when the Fuehrer had created the second and even more
important condition for an effective rearmament, in the coordination
of the whole nation and in the fusion of the political,
financial and spiritual powers, could the work of the
soldier find its fulfilment.</p>

<p>“The framework of this Peace Treaty, the most shameful
known in world history, collapsed under the driving power of
this united will.” (<span class='it'>C-156</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, the German Navy and the Nazis were in comradely agreement
and full collaboration. Hitler was giving the military leaders
the chance they wanted. Jodl stated the situation clearly in his
speech to the Gauleiters on 7 November 1943 (<span class='it'>L-172</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“1. The fact that the National-Socialist movement and its
struggle for internal power were the preparatory stage of the
outer liberation from the bonds of the Dictate of Versailles
is not one on which I need enlarge in this circle. I should like
however to mention at this point how clearly all thoughtful
regular soldiers realize what an important part has been
played by the National-Socialist movement in re-awakening
the will to fight [<span class='it'>Wehrwillen</span>] in nurturing fighting strength
[<span class='it'>Wehrkraft</span>] and in rearming the German people. In spite
of all the virtue inherent in it, the numerically small <span class='it'>Reichswehr</span>
would never have been able to cope with this task, if
only because of its own restricted radius of action. Indeed,
what the Fuehrer aimed at—and has so happily been successful
in bringing about—was the fusion of these two forces.</p>

<p>“2. The seizure of power in its turn has meant in the first
place restoration of fighting sovereignty [<span class='it'>Wehrhoheit</span>] (conscription,
occupation of the Rhineland) and rearmament with
special emphasis being laid on the creation of a modern armoured
and air arm.” (<span class='it'>L-172</span>)</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pageno' title='334' id='Page_334'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor were the high-ranking German officers unaware that the
policies and objectives of the Nazis were leading Germany in the
direction of war. Notes made by Admiral Carls of the German
Navy in September 1938 by way of comment on a “Draft study
of Naval Warfare against England,” read as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“A. There is full agreement with the main theme of the study.</p>

<p>“1. If according to the Fuehrer’s decision Germany is to acquire
a position as a world power she needs not only sufficient
colonial possessions but also secure naval communications and
secure access to the ocean.</p>

<p>“2. Both requirements can only be fulfilled in opposition to
Anglo-French interests and would limit their position as
world powers. It is unlikely that they can be achieved by
peaceful means. The decision to make Germany a world
power therefore forces upon us the necessity of making the
corresponding preparations for war.</p>

<p>“3. War against England means at the same time war against
the Empire, against France, probably against Russia as well
and a large number of countries overseas, in fact against one-half
to one-third of the whole world.</p>

<p>“It can only be justified and have a chance of success if it is
prepared <span class='it'>economically</span> as well as <span class='it'>politically</span> and <span class='it'>militarily</span> and
waged with the aim of conquering for Germany an outlet to
the ocean.” (<span class='it'>C-23</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The German Air Force, during this prewar period, was developing
even more radically aggressive plans for the aggrandizement
of the Reich. A study prepared by the chief, Kammhuber, of a
branch of the General Staff of the Air Force called the “Organization
Staff”, contained recommendations for the organization of
the German Air Force in future years up to 1950 (<span class='it'>L-43</span>). The
recommendations are based on certain assumptions, one of which
was that by 1950 the frontiers of Germany would be as shown on
the map which is attached as an inclosure to this study (<span class='it'>Chart
Number 10</span>). On this map Austria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland,
and the Baltic coast up to the Gulf of Finland are all included
within the borders of the Reich. Kammhuber also envisaged the
future peacetime organization of the German Air Force as comprising
seven “Group Commands.” Four of these were to lie
within the borders of Germany proper, at Berlin, Brunswick,
Munich, and Koenigsberg, but the three others are proposed to be
at Vienna, Budapest, and Warsaw. (<span class='it'>L-43</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The basic agreement and harmony between the Nazis and the
German military leaders cannot be overemphasized. Without this
agreement on objectives there might never have been a war. In
<span class='pageno' title='335' id='Page_335'></span>
this connection, an affidavit (<span class='it'>3704-PS</span>) by von Blomberg, formerly
Field Marshall, Reich War Minister, and Commander-in-Chief
of the German Armed Forces until February 1938, is significant:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“From 1919, and particularly from 1924, three critical territorial
questions occupied attention in Germany. These were
the questions of the Polish Corridor, the Ruhr and Memel.</p>

<p>“I myself, as well as the whole group of German staff officers,
believed that these three questions, outstanding among which
was the question of the Polish Corridor, would have to be
settled some day, if necessary by force of arms. About ninety
percent of the German people were of the same mind as the
officers on the Polish question. A war to wipe out the desecration
involved in the creation of the Polish Corridor and
to lessen the threat to separated East Prussia surrounded by
Poland and Lithuania was regarded as a sacred duty though
a sad necessity. This was one of the chief reasons behind
the partially secret rearmament which began about ten years
before Hitler came to power and was accentuated under Nazi
rule.</p>

<p>“Before 1938-1939 the German generals were not opposed
to Hitler. There was no reason to oppose Hitler since he produced
the results which they desired. After this time some
generals began to condemn his methods and lost confidence
in the power of his judgment. However they failed as a group
to take any definite stand against him, although a few of them
tried to do so and as a result had to pay for this with their
lives or their positions.</p>

<p>“Shortly before my removal from the post of Commander-in-Chief
of the Armed Forces in January 1938, Hitler asked
me to recommend a successor. I suggested Goering, who was
the ranking officer, but Hitler objected because of his lack of
patience and diligence. I was replaced as Commander-in-Chief
of the Armed Forces by no officer, but Hitler personally
took over my function as Commander. Keitel was recommended
by me as a Chef de bureau. As far as I know he was
never named Commander of the Armed Forces but was always
merely a ‘Chief of Staff’ under Hitler and in effect conducted
the administrative functions of the Ministry of War. At my
time Keitel was not opposed to Hitler and therefore was qualified
to bring about a good understanding between Hitler and
the Armed Forces, a thing which I myself desired and had
furthered as <span class='it'>Reichswehrminister</span> and <span class='it'>Reichskriegsminister</span>.
To do the opposite would have led to a civil war, for at that
<span class='pageno' title='336' id='Page_336'></span>
time the mass of the German people supported Hitler. Many
are no longer willing to admit this. But it is the truth.</p>

<p>“As I heard, Keitel did not oppose any of Hitler’s measures.
He became a willing tool in Hitler’s hands for every one of
his decisions.</p>

<p>“He did not measure up to what might have been expected of
him.” (<span class='it'>3704-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This statement by von Blomberg is paralleled closely in some respects
by an affidavit by Colonel General Blaskowitz (<span class='it'>3706-PS</span>).
Blaskowitz commanded an army in the campaign against Poland
and the campaign against France. He subsequently took command
of Army Group G in southern France, and held command of Army
Group H, which retreated beyond the Rhine at the end of the war.
His statement is as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * After the annexation of Czechoslovakia we hoped
that the Polish question would be settled in a peaceful fashion
through diplomatic means, since we believed that this time
France and England would come to the assistance of their
ally. As a matter of fact we felt that, if political negotiations
came to naught, the Polish question would unavoidably lead
to war, that is, not only with Poland herself, but also with the
Western Powers.</p>

<p>“When in the middle of June I received an order from the
OKH to prepare myself for an attack on Poland, I knew that
this war came even closer to the realm of possibility. This
conclusion was only strengthened by the Fuehrer’s speech
on 22 August 1939 on the Obersalzberg when it clearly seemed
to be an actuality. Between the middle of June 1939 and 1
September 1939 the members of my staff who were engaged
in preparations, participated in various discussions which
went on between the OKH and the army group. During these
discussions such matters of a tactical, strategic and general
nature were discussed as had to do with my future position as
Commander-in-Chief of the Eighth Army during the planned
Polish campaign.</p>

<p>“During the Polish campaign, particularly during the Kutno
operations, I was repeatedly in communication with the Commander-in-Chief
of the Army, and he, as well as the Fuehrer,
visited my headquarters. In fact it was common practice for
commanders-in-chief of army groups and of armies to be
asked from time to time for estimates of the situation and
for their recommendations by telephone, teletype or wireless,
as well as by personal calls. These front commanders-in-chief
thus actually became advisers to the OKH in their own field
<span class='pageno' title='337' id='Page_337'></span>
so that the positions shown in the attached chart embrace that
group which was the actual advisory council of the High
Command of the German Armed Forces.” (<span class='it'>3706-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It should be noted that General Blaskowitz, like Colonel General
Halder and Field Marshall von Brauchitsch, vouches for the accuracy
of the structure and organization of the General Staff and
High Command group as described by the prosecution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is, accordingly, clear beyond dispute that the military leaders
of Germany knew of, approved, supported, and executed plans
for the expansion of the Armed Forces beyond the limits set by
treaties. The objectives they had in mind are obvious from the
affidavits and documents to which reference has been made. In
these documents and affidavits we see the Nazis and the Generals
in agreement upon the basic objective of aggrandizing Germany
by force or threat of force, and collaborating to build up the armed
might of Germany in order to make possible the subsequent acts
of aggression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) <span class='it'>Austria.</span> Notes taken by Colonel Hossbach of a conference
held in the Reich Chancellery in Berlin on 5 November 1937 show
that this conference, at which Hitler presided, was small and highly
secret (<span class='it'>386-PS</span>). The only other participants were the four
principal military leaders, the Minister of Foreign Affairs (von
Neurath), and Hossbach acting as Secretary. The four chief leaders
of the Armed Forces—Blomberg, who was then Reich Minister
for War, and the Commanders-in-Chief of the three branches
of the Armed Forces, von Fritsch for the Army, Raeder for the
Navy, and Goering for the Air Force—were present. Hitler embarked
on a general discussion of Germany’s diplomatic and military
policy, and stated that the conquest of Austria and Czechoslovakia
was an essential preliminary “for the improvement of
our military position” and “in order to remove any threat from
the flanks”. (<span class='it'>386-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The military and political advantages envisaged included the
acquisition of a new source of food, shorter and better frontiers,
the release of troops for other tasks, and the possibility of forming
new divisions from the population of the conquered territories.
Von Blomberg and von Fritsch joined in the discussion and von
Fritsch stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“That it was the purpose of a study which he had laid on
for this winter to investigate the possibilities of carrying out
operations against Czechoslovakia with special consideration
of the conquest of the Czechoslovakian system of fortifications”
(<span class='it'>386-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pageno' title='338' id='Page_338'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In the following Spring, March 1938, the German plans with
respect to Austria came to fruition. Entries in the diary kept by
Jodl show the participation of the German military leaders in the
absorption of Austria (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>). As is shown by Jodl’s diary
entry for 11 February 1938, Keitel and other generals were present
at the Obersalzberg meeting between Schuschnigg and Hitler:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“<span class='it'>11 February</span></p>

<p>“In the evening and on 12 February General K. with General
V. Reichenau and Sperrle at the Obersalzberg. Schuschnigg
together with G. Schmidt are again being put under heaviest
political and military pressure. At 2300 hours Schuschnigg
signs protocol”. (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Two days later Keitel and others were preparing proposals to be
submitted to Hitler which would give the Austrian government the
impression that Germany would resort to force unless the
Schuschnigg agreement was ratified in Vienna:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“<span class='it'>13 February</span></p>

<p>“In the afternoon General K. asks Admiral C. and myself
to come to his apartment. He tells us that the Fuehrer order
is to the effect that military pressure by shamming military
action should be kept up until the 15th. Proposals for these
deceptive maneuvers are drafted and submitted to the Fuehrer
by telephone for approval”. (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These proposals are embodied in a document 14 February 1938
and signed by Keitel (<span class='it'>1775-PS</span>). Portions of Keitel’s proposals to
the Fuehrer are as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“1. To take no real preparatory measures in the Army or
Luftwaffe. No troop movements or redeployments.</p>

<p>“2. Spread false, but quite credible news, which may lead
to the conclusion of military preparations against Austria,</p>

<p>“5. Real maneuvers, training flights, and winter maneuvers

<p>“6. Admiral Canaris has to be ready beginning on February
14th in the Service Command Headquarters in order to carry
out measures given by order of the Chief of the OKW.”
(<span class='it'>1775-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>As Jodl’s diary entry for 14 February shows, these deceptive
maneuvers and threats of force were very effective in Austria:
<span class='pageno' title='339' id='Page_339'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The effect is quick and strong. In Austria the impression
is created that Germany is undertaking serious military
preparations.” (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>About a month later armed intervention was precipitated by
Schuschnigg’s decision to hold a plebiscite in Austria. Hitler
ordered mobilization in accordance with the preexisting plans
for the invasion of Austria (these plans were known as “Case
Otto”) in order to absorb Austria and stop the plebiscite. Jodl’s
diary entry for 10 March 1938 states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“By surprise and without consulting the ministers,
Schuschnigg ordered a plebiscite for Sunday, 13 March,
which should bring strong majority for the Legitimists in
the absence of plan or preparation.</p>

<p>“Fuehrer is determined not to tolerate it. The same night,
March 9 to 10, he calls for Goering, General V. Reichenau
is called back from Cairo Olympic Committee. General V.
Schobert is ordered to come, as well as Minister Glaise
Horstenau, who is with the District Leader [<span class='it'>Gauleiter</span>]
Burckel in the Palatinate. General Keitel communicates the
facts at 1:45. He drives to the Reichskanzlei at 10 o’clock.
I follow at 10:15, according to the wish of General V. Viebahn,
to give him the old draft.</p>

<p>‘Prepare case Otto’.” (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In an order 11 March, initialed by Keitel and Jodl, Hitler laid
down the general instructions for the invasion, and directed that
the Army and Air Force be ready for action by 12 March (<span class='it'>C-102</span>).
On the same evening Hitler ordered the invasion of Austria to
commence at daybreak on 12 March. The order was initialed by
Jodl. (<span class='it'>C-182</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The invasion of Austria differs from the other German acts
of aggression in that the invasion was not closely scheduled and
timed in advance. This was so simple because the invasion was
precipitated by an outside event, Schuschnigg’s order for the
plebiscite. But although for this reason the element of deliberately
timed planning was lacking, the foregoing documents make abundantly
clear the participation of the military leaders at all stages.
At the small policy meeting in November 1937, when Hitler’s
general program for Austria and Czechoslovakia was outlined,
the only others present were the four principal military leaders
and the Foreign Secretary (<span class='it'>386-PS</span>). In February, Keitel, Reichenau,
and Sperrle were present at Obersalzberg to help subject
Schuschnigg to “the heaviest military pressure” (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>). Keitel
and others immediately thereafter worked out and executed a
program of military threat and deception for frightening the
<span class='pageno' title='340' id='Page_340'></span>
Austrian Government into acceptance of the Schuschnigg protocol
(<span class='it'>1775-PS</span>). When the actual invasion took place it was, of course,
directed by the military leaders and executed by the German Armed
Forces. Jodl has given a clear statement of why the German military
leaders were delighted to join with the Nazis in bringing
about the end of Austrian independence. In his lecture to the
Gauleiters in November 1943 (<span class='it'>L-172</span>) Jodl explained:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Austrian ‘Anschluss’, in its turn, brought with it not
only fulfilment of an old national aim but also had the effect
both of reinforcing our fighting strength and of materially
improving our strategic position. Whereas up till then the
territory of Czechoslovakia had projected in a most menacing
way right into Germany (a wasp waist in the direction of
France and an air base for the Allies, in particular Russia),
Czechoslovakia herself was now enclosed by pincers. Its own
strategic position had now become so unfavorable that she
was bound to fall a victim to any attack pressed home with
vigour before effective aid from the West could be expected
to arrive”. (<span class='it'>L-172</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) <span class='it'>Czechoslovakia.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The steps in the planning for the invasion of Czechoslovakia
(“Case Green” or Fall Gruen) bear the evidence of knowing and
wilful participation by Keitel, Jodl, and other members of the
General Staff and High Command Group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Hossbach minutes of the conference between Hitler and
the four principal German military leaders on 5 November 1937
show, that Austria and Czechoslovakia were then listed as the first
intended victims of German aggression (<span class='it'>386-PS</span>). After the
absorption of Austria in March 1938, Hitler as head of the State
and Keitel as Chief of all the armed forces lost no time in turning
their attention to Czechoslovakia. In the Hitler-Keitel discussions
on 21 April 1938 a nice balance of political and military factors
was worked out (<span class='it'>388-PS</span>):</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>“A. <span class='it'>Political Aspect</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>1. Strategic surprise attack out of a clear sky without any
cause or possibility of justification has been turned down. As result
would be: hostile world opinion which can lead to a critical
situation. Such a measure is justified only for the elimination of
the last opponent on the mainland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. Action after a time of diplomatic clashes, which gradually
come to a crisis and lead to war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. Lightning-swift action as the result of an incident (e.g. assassination
of German ambassador in connection with an anti-German
demonstration).
<span class='pageno' title='341' id='Page_341'></span></p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>B. <span class='it'>Military Conclusions</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>1. The preparations are to be made for the political possibilities
2 and 3. Case 2 is the undesired one since “Gruen” will have taken
security measures.</p>

<p class='pindent'> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>4. Politically, the first 4 days of military action are the decisive
ones. If there are no effective military successes, a European
crisis will certainly arise. Accomplished facts must prove the
senselessness of foreign military intervention, draw Allies into the
scheme (division of spoils!) and demoralize “Gruen”.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore: bridging the time gap between first penetration and
employment of the forces to be brought up, by a determined and
ruthless thrust by a motorized army. (e.g. via Pi past Pr) [Pilsen,
Prague]. (<span class='it'>388-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>From this point on, nearly the whole story is contained in the
Schmundt file (<span class='it'>388-PS</span>) and in Jodl’s diary (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>). These
two sources of information demolish in advance what will, no
doubt, be urged in defense of the military defendants and the
General Staff and High Command Group. They will seek to create
the impression that the German generals were pure military
technicians; that they were uninterested and uninformed about
political and diplomatic considerations and events; that they passed
their days mounting mock battles at the <span class='it'>Kriegsakadamie</span>; that
they prepared plans for military attack or defense, on a purely
hypothetical basis. They will say all this in order to suggest that
they did not share and could not estimate Hitler’s aggressive
intentions, and that they carried out politically conceived orders
like military automatons, with no idea whether the wars they
launched and waged were aggressive or not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If these arguments are made, the Schmundt file (<span class='it'>388-PS</span>) and
Jodl’s diary (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>) make it abundantly apparent that aggressive
designs were conceived jointly between the Nazis and the generals;
that the military leaders were fully posted on the aggressive
intentions of the Nazis; that they were fully informed of political
and diplomatic developments; that indeed German generals had
a habit of turning up at diplomatic gatherings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the documents did not show these things so clearly, a moment’s
thought must show them to be true. A highly successful
program of conquest depends on armed might, and cannot be
executed with an unprepared, weak, or recalcitrant military
leadership. It has, of course, been said that war is too important
a business to be left to soldiers alone. It is equally true that aggressive
diplomacy is far too dangerous a business to be conducted
without military advice and military support.
<span class='pageno' title='342' id='Page_342'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>No doubt some of the German generals had qualms about Hitler’s
timing and the boldness of some of his moves. Some of these
doubts are rather amusingly reflected in an entry in Jodl’s diary
for 10 August 1938:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Army chiefs and the chiefs of the Air Force groups,
Lt. Col. Jeschonnek and myself are ordered to the Berghof.
After dinner the Fuehrer makes a speech lasting for almost
three hours, in which he develops his political thoughts. The
subsequent attempts to draw the Fuehrer’s attention to the
defects of our preparation, which are undertaken by a few
generals of the Army, are rather unfortunate. This applies
especially to the remark of General Wietersheim, in which
to top it off he claims to quote from General Adams [<span class='it'>die er
noch dazu dem General Adams in den Mund legt</span>] that the
western fortifications can only be held for three weeks. The
Fuehrer becomes very indignant and flames up, bursting into
the remark that in such a case the whole Army would not be
good for anything. ‘I assure you, General, the position will not
only be held for three weeks, but for three years.’ The cause
of this despondent opinion, which unfortunately enough is
held very widely within the Army General Staff, is based on
various reasons. First of all, it [the General Staff] is
restrained by old memories; political considerations play a
part as well, instead of obeying and executing its military
mission. That is certainly done with traditional devotion, but
the vigor of the soul is lacking because in the end they do not
believe in the genius of the Fuehrer. And one does perhaps
compare him with Charles XII. And since water flows downhill,
this defeatism may not only possibly cause immense
political damage, for the opposition between the General’s
opinion and that of the Fuehrer is common talk, but may also
constitute a danger for the morale of the troops. But I have
no doubt that [?] the Fuehrer will be able to boost the morale
of the people in an unexpected way when the right moment
comes.” (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>But if this entry shows that some of the German generals at that
time were cautious with respect to Germany’s ability to take on
Poland and the Western Powers simultaneously, nonetheless the
entry shows no lack of sympathy with the Nazi aims for conquest.
And there is no evidence in Jodl’s diary or elsewhere that any
substantial number of German generals lacked sympathy with
Hitler’s objectives. Furthermore, the top military leaders always
joined with and supported his decisions, with formidable success
in the years from 1938 to 1942.
<span class='pageno' title='343' id='Page_343'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>If it is said that German military leaders did not know that
German general policy toward Czechoslovakia was aggressive,
or based on force and threat of force, it may be noted that on 30
May 1938 Hitler signed a Most Secret directive to Keitel (<span class='it'>388-PS
Item 11</span>) in which he said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“It is my unalterable decision to smash Czechoslovakia by
military action in the near future. It is the job of the political
leaders to await or bring about the politically and militarily
suitable moment.</p>

<p>“An inevitable development of conditions inside Czechoslovakia
or other political events in Europe creating a surprisingly
favorable opportunity and one which may never
come again may cause me to take early action.</p>

<p>“The proper choice and determined and full utilization of a
favorable moment is the surest guarantee of success. Accordingly
the preparations are to be made at once.” (<span class='it'>388-PS
Item 11</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Jodl was in no doubt what this meant. He noted in his diary that
same day:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Fuehrer signs directive ‘Green’, where he states his final
decision to destroy Czechoslovakia soon and thereby initiates
military preparation all along the line”. (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The succeeding evidence in the Schmundt file (<span class='it'>388-PS Items
14, 16, 17</span>) and in the Jodl diary (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>) shows how those military
preparations went forward “all along the line.” Numerous
examples of discussions, planning, and preparation during the last
few weeks before the Munich Pact, including discussions with
Hungary and the Hungarian General Staff in which General
Halder participated, are contained in the Jodl diary (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>)
and the later items in the Schmundt file (<span class='it'>388-PS Items
18 to 22, 24, 26 to 28, 31 to 34, 36 to 54</span>). The day the Munich
Pact was signed, Jodl noted in his diary:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Munich Pact is signed. Czechoslovakia as a power is out.
Four zones as set forth will be occupied between the 2nd and
7th of October. The remaining part of mainly German
character will be occupied by the 10th of October. The genius
of the Fuehrer and his determination not to shun even a World
War have again won the victory without the use of force. The
hope remains that the incredulous, the weak and the doubtful
people have been converted and will remain that way.”
(<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Plans for the “liquidation” of the remainder of Czechoslovakia
were made soon after Munich (<span class='it'>388-PS Item 40</span>; <span class='it'>C-136</span>; <span class='it'>C-138</span>).
Ultimately the absorption was accomplished by diplomatic bullying
<span class='pageno' title='344' id='Page_344'></span>
in which Keitel participated for the usual purposes of demonstrating
that German armed might was ready to enforce the threats
(<span class='it'>2802-PS</span>). Once again, Jodl in his 1943 lecture (<span class='it'>L-172</span>) explained
clearly why the objective of eliminating Czechoslovakia
lay as close to the hearts of the German military leaders as to the
hearts of the Nazis:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The bloodless solution of the Czech conflict in the autumn
of 1938 and spring of 1939 and the annexation of Slovakia
rounded off the territory of Greater Germany in such a way
that it then became possible to consider the Polish problem
on the basis of more or less favorable strategic premises.”
(<span class='it'>L-172</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This serves to recall the affidavits by Blomberg (<span class='it'>3704-PS</span>) and
Blaskowitz (<span class='it'>3706-PS</span>) already quoted:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The whole group of German staff and front officers believed
that the question of the Polish Corridor would have to be
settled some day, if necessary by force of arms.”</p>

<p>“A war to wipe out the political and economic losses resulting
from the creation of the Polish Corridor was regarded as a
sacred duty though a sad necessity.”</p>

<p>“Before 1938-39, the German generals were not opposed to
Hitler.”</p>

<p>“Hitler produced the results which all of us warmly desired.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) <span class='it'>Poland.</span> The story of the German attack on Poland furnishes
an excellent case study of the functioning of the General
Staff and High Command Group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reference is made to the series of directives from Hitler and
Keitel involving “Fall Weiss” (<span class='it'>C-120</span>). The series starts with a
re-issuance of the “Directive for the Uniform Preparation for
War by the Armed Forces”. This periodically re-issued directive
was encountered previously in the case of Czechoslovakia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In essence these directives are (<span class='it'>a</span>) statements of what the Armed
Forces must be prepared to accomplish in view of political and
diplomatic policies and developments, and (<span class='it'>b</span>) indications of what
should be accomplished diplomatically in order to make the military
tasks easier and the chances of success greater. They constitute,
in fact, a fusion of diplomatic and military thought and
strongly demonstrate the mutual inter-dependence of aggressive
diplomacy and military planning. The distribution of these documents
early in April 1939, in which the preparations of plans for
the Polish war is ordered, was limited. Five copies only are
distributed by Keitel: one to Brauchitsch (OKH), one to Raeder
(OKM), one to Goering (OKL), and two to Warlimont in the
Planning Branch of OKW. Hitler lays down that the plan must
<span class='pageno' title='345' id='Page_345'></span>
be susceptible of execution by 1 September 1939, and that target
date was adhered to. The fusion of military and diplomatic
thought is clearly brought out by the following part of one of those
documents:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“1. <span class='it'>Political Requirements and Aims.</span> German relations with
Poland continue to be based on the principle of avoiding any
quarrels. Should Poland, however, change her policy towards
Germany, based up to now on the same principles as our own,
and adopt a threatening attitude towards Germany, a final
settlement might become necessary, notwithstanding the pact
in effect with Poland.</p>

<p>“The aim then will be to destroy Polish military strength,
and create in the East a situation which satisfies the requirements
of national defense. The Free State of Danzig will be
proclaimed a part of the Reich-territory at the outbreak of
the conflict, at the latest.</p>

<p>“The political leadership considers it its task in this case to
isolate Poland if possible, that is to say, to limit the war to
Poland only.</p>

<p>“The development of increasing internal crises in France and
the resulting British cautiousness might produce such a situation
in the not too distant future.</p>

<p>“Intervention by Russia so far as she would be able to do this
cannot be expected to be of any use for Poland, because this
would imply Poland’s destruction by Bolshevism.</p>

<p>“The attitudes of the <span class='it'>Baltic States</span> will be determined wholly
by German military exigencies.</p>

<p>“On the German side, Hungary cannot be considered a certain
German ally. Italy’s attitude is determined by the Berlin-Rome
Axis.</p>

<p>“2. <span class='it'>Military Conclusions.</span> The great objectives in the building
up of the German Armed Forces will continue to be determined
by the antagonism of the ‘Western Democracies’.
‘Fall Weiss’ constitutes only a precautionary complement to
these preparations. It is not to be looked upon in any way,
however, as the necessary prerequisite for a military settlement
with the Western opponents.</p>

<p>“The isolation of Poland will be more easily maintained, even
after the beginning of operations, if we succeed in starting
the war with heavy, sudden blows and in gaining rapid
successes.</p>

<p>“The entire situation will require, however, that precautions
be taken to safeguard the western boundary and the German
North Sea coast, as well as the air over them.” (<span class='it'>C-120</span>)</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pageno' title='346' id='Page_346'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>It cannot be suggested that these are hypothetical plans, or that
the General Staff and High Command Group did not know what
was in prospect. The plans show on their face that they are in
earnest and no war game. The point is reinforced by Schmundt’s
notes on the conference in Hitler’s study at the Reich Chancellery,
Berlin, on 23 May 1939 (<span class='it'>L-79</span>). At this conference Hitler announced:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“There is, therefore, no question of sparing Poland, and we
are left with the decision: <span class='it'>to attack Poland at the first suitable
opportunity</span>”. (<span class='it'>L-79</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Besides Hitler and a few military aides and adjutants, the following
were present: Goering (C-in-C <span class='it'>Luftwaffe</span>); Raeder (C-in-C
Navy); Keitel (Chief, OKW); von Brauchitsch (C-in-C Army);
Col. General Milch (Inspector General of the <span class='it'>Luftwaffe</span>); Gen.
Bodenschatz (Goering’s personal assistant); Rear Admiral
Schnievindt (Chief of the Naval War Staff); Col. Jeschonnek
(Chief of the Air Staff); Col. Warlimont (Planning Staff of
OKW). All except Milch, Bodenschatz, and the adjutants are
members of the Group as defined in the Indictment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The initial and general planning of the attack on Poland, however,
had to be examined, checked, corrected, and perfected by the
field commanders who were to carry out the attack. In a document
issued in the middle of June 1939 (<span class='it'>C-142</span>), von Brauchitsch as
C-in-C of the Army passed on the general outlines of the plan
to the field commanders-in-chief (the <span class='it'>Oberbefehlshaber</span> of Army
Groups and Armies) so that they could work out the actual preparation
and deployments in accordance with the general plan:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The object of the operation is to <span class='it'>destroy the Polish Armed
Forces</span>. High policy demands that the war should be begun
by heavy surprise blows in order to achieve quick results.
<span class='it'>The intention of the Army High Command</span> is to prevent a
regular mobilization and concentration of the Polish Army
by a surprise invasion of Polish territory and to destroy the
mass of the Polish Army which is to be expected to be west
of the Vistula-Narve line. This is to be achieved by a concentric
attack from Silesia on one side and Pomerania-East
Prussia on the other side. The possible influence from Galicia
against this operation must be eliminated. The main idea of
the destruction of the Polish Army west of the Vistula-Narve
Line with the elimination of the possible influence from Galicia
remains unchanged even if advanced preparedness for defense
on the part of the Polish Army, caused by previous political
tension, should have to be taken into consideration. In such
a case it may be a question of not making the first attack
<span class='pageno' title='347' id='Page_347'></span>
mainly with mechanized and motorized forces but of waiting
for the arrival of stronger, non-motorized units. The Army
High Command will then give the correspondingly later time
for the crossing of the frontier. The endeavour to obtain a
quick success will be maintained.</p>

<p>“The Army Group Commands and the Army Commands
(A.O.K.) will make their preparations on the basis of surprise
of the enemy. There will be alterations necessary if surprise
should have to be abandoned: these will have to be developed
simply and quickly on the same basis: they are to be prepared
mentally to such an extent, that in case of an order from the
Army High Command they can be carried out quickly.”
(<span class='it'>C-142</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A document of approximately the same date reveals an <span class='it'>Oberbefehlshaber</span>
at work in the field planning the attack (<span class='it'>2327-PS</span>).
This document, signed by Blaskowitz, at the time the commander-in-chief
of the Third Army Area Command and commander-in-chief
of the 8th Army during the Polish campaign, states in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The commander-in-chief of the army has ordered the working
out of a <span class='it'>plan of deployment against Poland</span> which takes in
account the demands of the political leadership for the opening
of war by surprise and for quick success.</p>

<p>“The order of deployment by the High Command, ‘<span class='it'>Fall Weiss</span>’
authorizes the Third Army Group [in <span class='it'>Fall Weiss</span>, 8th Army
Headquarters] to give necessary directions and orders to all
commands subordinated to it for ‘<span class='it'>Fall Weiss</span>’.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The whole correspondence on ‘<span class='it'>Fall Weiss</span>’ has to be conducted
under the classification Top Secret [<span class='it'>Chefsache</span>]. This is to
be disregarded only if the content of a document, in the judgment
of the chief of the responsible command is harmless in
every way—even in connection with other documents.</p>

<p>“For the middle of July a conference is planned where details
on the execution will be discussed. Time and place will be
ordered later on. Special requests are to be communicated to
Third Army Group before 10 July.</p>

<p>“I declare it the duty of the Commanding Generals, the
divisional commanders and the commandants to limit as much
as possible the number of persons who will be informed, and
to limit the extent of the information and ask that all suitable
measures be taken to prevent persons not concerned from
getting information.</p>

<p>“The Commander-in-Chief of Army Area Command</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>“(signed)&nbsp;&nbsp;F. Blaskowitz.”</p>

<p><span class='pageno' title='348' id='Page_348'></span></p>

<p>“<span class='it'>Aims of Operation ‘Fall Weiss’</span></p>

<p>“1. a. The operation, in order to forestall an orderly Polish
mobilization and concentration, is to be opened by surprise
with forces which are for the most part armored and motorized,
placed on alert in the neighborhood of the border. The
initial superiority over the Polish frontier-guards and surprise
that can be expected with certainty are to be maintained by
quickly bringing up other parts of the army as well to counteract
the marching up of the Polish Army.</p>

<p>“Accordingly all units have to keep the initiative against
the foe by quick action and ruthless attacks.” (<span class='it'>2327-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, a week before the actual onslaught, when all the military
plans have been laid, The General Staff and High Command Group
all gathered in one place, in fact all in one room. On 23 August
1939 the <span class='it'>Oberbefehlshaber</span> assembled at Obersalzberg to hear
Hitler’s explanation of the timing of the attack, and to receive
political and diplomatic orientation from the head of the State
(<span class='it'>798-PS</span>). This speech, the second of the two examples referred to
in the initial affidavits by Halder (<span class='it'>3702-PS</span>) and Brauchitsch
(<span class='it'>3703-PS</span>), was addressed to the very group defined in the indictment
as the General Staff and High Command Group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>d</span>) <span class='it'>The War Period, September 1939-June 1941: Norway,
Denmark, Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Yugoslavia, Greece.</span>
On 1 September 1939 Germany launched the war. Within a few
weeks, and before any important action on the western front,
Poland was overrun and conquered. German losses were insignificant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “three principal territorial questions” mentioned in the
Blomberg (<span class='it'>3704-PS</span>) and Blaskowitz (<span class='it'>3706-PS</span>) affidavits had
all been solved. The Rhineland had been reoccupied and fortified,
Memel annexed, and the Polish Corridor annexed. And much more
too. Austria had become a part of the Reich, and Czechoslovakia
was occupied and a Protectorate of Germany. All of western
Poland was in German hands. Germany was superior in arms,
and in experience in their use, to her western enemies, France and
England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came the three years of the war—1939, 1940, 1941—when
German armed might swung like a great scythe from north
to south to east. Italy, Rumania, Hungary, and Bulgaria had become
German allies. Norway and Denmark; the Low Countries;
France; Tripoli and Egypt; Yugoslavia and Greece; the western
part of the Soviet Union—all this territory was invaded and
overrun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the period from the fall of Poland in October 1939 to the attack
<span class='pageno' title='349' id='Page_349'></span>
against the Soviet Union in June 1941, occurred the aggressive
wars, in violation of treaties, against Norway, Denmark, Holland,
Belgium, Luxembourg, Yugoslavia, and Greece. But one thing
is certain: neither the Nazis nor the generals thought during this
period in terms of a series of violations of neutrality and treaties.
They thought in terms of a war, a war for the conquest of Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Six weeks after the outbreak of war, and upon the successful
termination of the Polish campaign, on 9 October 1939, there
was issued a “Memorandum and Directive for the Conduct of
the War in the West.” (<span class='it'>L-52</span>). It is unsigned, was distributed only
to the four service chiefs (Keitel, Brauchitsch, Goering, and
Raeder) and gives every indication of having been issued by
Hitler. The following are pertinent extracts:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The aim of the Anglo-French conduct of war is to dissolve
or disintegrate the 80 million state again so that in this manner
the European equilibrium, in other words the balance of
power, which serves their ends, may be restored. This battle
therefore will have to be fought out by the German people
one way or another. Nevertheless, the very great successes
of the first month of war could serve, in the event of an immediate
signing of peace to strengthen the Reich psychologically
and materially to such an extent that from the German
viewpoint there would be no objection to ending the war
immediately, insofar as the present achievement with arms
is not jeopardized by the peace-treaty.</p>

<p>“It is not the object of this memorandum to study the possibilities
in this direction or even to take them into consideration.
In this paper I shall confine myself exclusively to the
other case; the necessity to continue the fight, the object of
which, as already stressed, consists so far as the enemy is
concerned in the dissolution or destruction of the German
Reich. In opposition to this, the German war aim is the final
military dispatch of the West, i.e. destruction of the power
and ability of the Western Powers ever again to be able to
oppose the state consolidation and further development of the
German people in Europe.</p>

<p>“As far as the outside world is concerned, however, this internal
aim will have to undergo various propaganda adjustments,
necessary from a psychological point of view. This
does not alter the war aim. It is and remains the destruction
of our Western enemies.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The successes of the Polish campaign have made possible
first of all a war on a single front, awaited for past decades
<span class='pageno' title='350' id='Page_350'></span>
without any hope of realization, that is to say, Germany is
able to enter the fight in the West with all her might, leaving
only a few covering troops.</p>

<p>“The remaining European states are neutral either because
they fear for their own fates, or lack interest in the conflict
as such, or are interested in a certain outcome of the war,
which prevents them from taking part at all or at any rate
too soon.</p>

<p>“The following is to be firmly borne in mind * * *”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“<span class='it'>Belgium and Holland</span>—Both countries are interested in preserving
their neutrality but incapable of withstanding prolonged
pressure from England and France. The preservation
of their colonies, the maintenance of their trade, and thus the
securing of their interior economy, even of their very life,
depend wholly upon the will of England and France. Therefore,
in their decisions, in their attitude, and in their actions,
both countries are dependent upon the West, in the highest
degree. If England and France promise themselves a successful
result at the price of Belgian neutrality, they are at any
time in a position to apply the necessary pressure. That is
to say, without covering themselves with the odium of a breach
of neutrality, they can compel Belgium and Holland to give
up their neutrality. Therefore, in the matter of the preservation
of Belgo-Dutch neutrality time is not a factor which might
promise a favorable development for Germany.</p>

<p>“<span class='it'>The Nordic States</span>—Provided no completely unforeseen
factors appear, their neutrality in the future is also to be
assumed. The continuation of German trade with these
countries appears possible even in a war of long duration.”
(<span class='it'>L-52</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Six weeks later, on 23 November 1939, the group of <span class='it'>Oberbefehlshaber</span>
again assembled and heard from Hitler much of what
he had said previously to the four service chiefs (<span class='it'>789-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“For the first time in history we have to fight on only one
front, the other front is at present free. But no one can know
how long that will remain so. I have doubted for a long time
whether I should strike in the east and then in the west.
Basically I did not organize the armed forces in order not to
strike. The decision to strike was always in me. Earlier or
later I wanted to solve the problem. Under pressure it was
decided that the east was to be attacked first. If the Polish
war was won so quickly, it was due to the superiority of our
armed forces. The most glorious appearance in history. Unexpectedly
<span class='pageno' title='351' id='Page_351'></span>
small expenditures of men and material. Now
the eastern front is held by only a few divisions. It is a situation
which we viewed previously as unachievable. Now the
situation is as follows: The opponent in the west lies behind
his fortifications. There is no possibility of coming to grips
with him. The decisive question is: how long can we endure
this situation.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“Everything is determined by the fact that the moment is
favorable now; in 6 months it might not be so anymore.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“England cannot live without its imports. We can feed ourselves.
The permanent sowing of mines on the English coasts
will bring England to her knees. However, this can only
occur if we have occupied Belgium and Holland. It is a difficult
decision for me. None has ever achieved what I have
achieved. My life is of no importance in all this. I have led the
German people to a great height, even if the world does hate
us now. I am setting this work on a gamble. I have to choose
between victory or destruction. I choose victory. Greatest
historical choice, to be compared with the decision of Friedrich
the Great before the first Silesian war. Prussia owes its
rise to the heroism of one man. Even there the closest advisers
were disposed to capitulation. Everything depended on Friedrich
the Great. Even the decisions of Bismarck in 1866 and
1870 were no less great. My decision is unchangeable. I shall
attack France and England at the most favorable and quickest
moment. Breach of the neutrality of Belgium and Holland
is meaningless. No one will question that when we have won.
We shall not bring about the breach of neutrality as idiotically
as it was in 1914. If we do not break the neutrality, then
England and France will. Without attack the war is not to
be ended victoriously. I consider it as possible to end the
war only by means of an attack. The question as to whether
the attack will be successful no one can answer. Everything
depends upon the favorable instant”. (<span class='it'>789-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thereafter the winter of 1939-40 passed quietly—the winter
of “phony war”. The General Staff and High Command Group all
knew what the plan was; they had all been told. It was to attack
ruthlessly at the first opportunity, to smash the French and English
forces, to pay no heed to treaties with, or the neutrality of, the
Low Countries.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Breaking of the neutrality of Belgium and Holland is meaningless.
<span class='pageno' title='352' id='Page_352'></span>
No one will question that when we have won.”
(<span class='it'>789-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>That is what Hitler told the <span class='it'>Oberbefehlshaber</span>. The generals and
admirals agreed and went forward with their plans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The military leaders may contend that all the steps in this march
of conquest were conceived by Hitler, and that the military leaders
embarked on them with reluctance and misgivings. Or they may
be restrained by pride from taking so undignified and degrading
a position as to suggest that German military leadership, the
bearers of the tradition of Schlieffen, Moltke, Spee and Hindenburg,
was cowed and coerced into war and plans of which they
did not approve by a gang of political adventurers. But whether
they make the argument or not, it is utterly without foundation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler’s utterances in October (<span class='it'>L-79</span>) and November (<span class='it'>789-PS</span>)
1939 are full of plans against France, England, and the Low
Countries but contain no suggestion of an attack on Scandinavia.
Indeed, Hitler’s memorandum of 9 October 1939 (<span class='it'>L-52</span>) to the
four service chiefs affirmatively indicates that he saw no reason
to disturb the situation to the North:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>The Northern States</span>—Providing no completely unforeseen
factors appear, their neutrality in the future is also to be
assumed. The continuance of trade with these countries appears
possible even in a war of long duration.” (<span class='it'>L-52</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>But a week previous, on 3 October 1939, Raeder had caused a
questionnaire to be circulated within the Naval War Staff, seeking
comments on the advantages which might be gained from a naval
standpoint by securing bases in Norway and Denmark (<span class='it'>C-122</span>).
Raeder was stimulated to circulate this questionnaire by a letter
from another Admiral named Carls, who pointed out the importance
of an occupation of the Norwegian coast by Germany
(<span class='it'>C-66</span>). (Rolf Carls later attained the rank of Admiral of the
Fleet, and commanded Naval Group North from January 1940 to
February 1943. In that capacity he is a member of the General
Staff and High Command Group as defined in the Indictment.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doenitz, at that time Flag Officer Submarines, on 9 October
1939, replied to the questionnaire that from his standpoint Trondheim
and Narvik met his requirements, that Trondheim was
preferable, and proposed the establishment of a U-boat base there
(<span class='it'>C-5</span>). Raeder’s visit to Hitler the next day and certain subsequent
events are described as follows (<span class='it'>L-323</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“<span class='it'>Entry in the War Diary of the C-in-C of the Navy (Naval
War Staff) on ‘Weseruebung’.</span> 1. 10 October 1939. First
reference of the C-in-C of the Navy (Naval War Staff), when
visiting the Fuehrer, to the significance of Norway for sea
<span class='pageno' title='353' id='Page_353'></span>
and air warfare. The Fuehrer intends to give the matter
consideration.</p>

<p>“12 December 1939. Fuehrer received Q &amp; H.</p>

<p>“Subsequent instructions to the Supreme Command of the
Armed Forces to make mental preparations. The C-in-C of
the Navy is having an essay prepared, which will be ready
in January. With reference to this essay, <span class='it'>Kapitan zur see</span>
Krancke is working on ‘<span class='it'>Weseruebung</span>’, and OKW.</p>

<p>“During the time which followed, H maintained contact with
the Chief of Staff of the C-in-C of the Navy. His aim was to
develop the Party Q with a view to making it capable of making
a coup, and to give the Supreme Command of the Navy
information on political developments in Norway and military
questions. In general he pressed for a speeding-up of preparations,
but considered that it was first necessary to expand
the organization. The support which had been promised him
in the form of money and coal was set in motion only very
slowly and came in small quantities, and he repeatedly complained
about this. It was not until the end of March that Q
considered the coup [<span class='it'>Aktion</span>] so urgent that the expansion
of his organization could not wait. The military advice of H
was passed on to the OKW.” (<span class='it'>L-323</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>On 12 December the Naval War Staff discussed the Norwegian
project with Hitler at a meeting which Keitel and Jodl also attended
(<span class='it'>C-64</span>). In the meantime, illustrating the close link between
the service chiefs and the Nazi politicians, Raeder was in touch
with Rosenberg on the possibilities of using Quisling (<span class='it'>C-65</span>). As
result of all this, on Hitler’s instructions Keitel issued an OKW
directive on 27 January 1940. The directive related that Hitler
had commissioned Keitel to take charge of preparation for the
Norway operation, to which he then gave the code name “<span class='it'>Weseruebung</span>.”
On 1 March 1940 Hitler issued the directive setting forth
the general plan for the invasion of Norway and Denmark
(<span class='it'>C-174</span>). The invasion itself took place on 9 April 1940. The
directive was initialled by Admiral Kurt Fricke who at that time
was head of the Operations Division of the Naval War Staff, and
who at the end of 1941 became Chief of the Naval War Staff. In
that capacity he too is a member of the Group as defined in the
Indictment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, as these documents make clear, the plan to invade Norway
and Denmark was not conceived in Nazi Party circles or forced
on the military leaders. On the contrary it was conceived in the
naval part of the General Staff and High Command Group, and
Hitler was persuaded to take up the idea. Treaties and neutrality
<span class='pageno' title='354' id='Page_354'></span>
meant just as little to the General Staff and High Command
Group as to the Nazis. Launching aggressive war against inoffensive
neighboring states gave the generals and admirals no
qualms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for the Low Countries, neither Hitler nor the military leaders
were disturbed about Treaty considerations. At the conferences
between Hitler and the principal military leaders in May 1939
(<span class='it'>L-79</span>), when the intention to attack Poland was announced, Hitler
in discussing the possibility of war with England said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Dutch and Belgian air bases must be occupied by armed
force. Declarations of neutrality will be ignored”. (<span class='it'>L-79</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And in the speech to the <span class='it'>Oberbefehlshaber</span> in November 1939
(<span class='it'>789-PS</span>), after the Polish victory, Hitler made clear his intention
to attack France and England by first invading the Low Countries.
“No one will question that when we have won,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accordingly, the winter of 1939-40 and the early spring of 1940
was a period of intensive planning in German military circles.
The major attack in the West through the Low Countries, and the
attack on Norway and Denmark had to be planned. Jodl’s diary
for the period 1 February to 26 May 1940 (<span class='it'>1809-PS</span>) contains
many entries reflecting the course of this planning. These entries
show that during February and early March there was considerable
doubt in German military circles as to whether the attack on
Norway and Denmark should precede or follow the attack on the
Low Countries; and that at some points there even was doubt as
to whether all these attacks were necessary from a military standpoint.
But there is not a single entry which reflects any hesitancy,
from a moral angle, on the part of Jodl or any of the people he
mentions to overrun these neutral countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 1 February 1940, General Jeschonnek (Chief of the Air
Staff and a member of the Group as defined in the Indictment)
visited Jodl and suggested that it might be wise to attack only
Holland, on the ground that Holland alone would “be a tremendous
improvement in conducting aerial warfare”. On 6 February,
Jodl conferred with Jeschonnek, Warlimont, and Col. von Waldau,
and what Jodl calls a “new idea” was proposed at this meeting:
that the Germans should “carry out actions H (Holland) and
Weser exercise (Norway and Denmark) only and guarantee Belgium’s
neutrality for the duration of the war” (<span class='it'>1809-PS</span>). The
German Air Force may have felt that occupation of Holland alone
would give them sufficient scope for air bases for attacks on England,
and that if Belgium’s neutrality were preserved the bases
in Holland would be immune from attack by the French and the
British armies in France. If, to meet this situation, the French
<span class='pageno' title='355' id='Page_355'></span>
and British attacked through Belgium, the violation of neutrality
would be on the other foot. But whether or not the “new idea”
made sense from a military angle, it appears to be a most extraordinary
notion from a diplomatic angle. It was a proposal to
violate, without any substantial excuse, the neutrality of three
neighboring small countries, and simultaneously to guarantee
the neutrality of a fourth. What value the Belgians might have
attributed to a guarantee of neutrality offered under such circumstances
it is difficult to imagine and in fact the “new idea” projected
at this meeting of military leaders is an extraordinary combination
of cynicism and naivete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime, as Jodl’s diary shows, on 5 February 1940
the “special staff” for the Norway invasion met for the first time
and got its instructions from Keitel (<span class='it'>1809-PS</span>). On 21 February
Hitler put General von Falkenhorst (who subsequently became an
<span class='it'>Oberbefehlshaber</span> and a member of the Group) in command of
the Norway undertaking; and Jodl’s diary records that “Falkenhorst
accepts gladly” (<span class='it'>1809-PS</span>). On 26 February Hitler was still
in doubt whether to go first into Norway or the Low Countries,
but on 3 March, he decided to do Norway first and the Low
Countries a short time thereafter. This decision proved final.
Norway and Denmark were invaded on 9 April and the success
of the venture was certain by the first of May; the invasion of
the Low Countries took place 10 days thereafter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>France and the Low Countries fell, Italy joined the war on the
side of Germany, and the African campaign began. In the meantime,
Goering’s Air Force hammered at England unsuccessfully,
and the planned invasion of Britain (“Operation <span class='it'>Seeloewe</span>”) never
came to pass. In October 1940 Italy attacked Greece and was
fought to better than a standstill. The Italo-Greek stalemate and
the uncertain attitude of Yugoslavia were embarrassing to Germany,
particularly because the attack on the Soviet Union was
being planned in the winter of 1940-41, and Germany felt she
could not risk an uncertain situation at her rear in the Balkans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accordingly, it was decided to end the Greek situation by coming
to Italy’s aid, and the Yugoslavian coup d’etat of 26 March
1940 brought about the final German decision to crush Yugoslavia
also. The aggressive nature of the German attacks on Greece
and Yugoslavia are demonstrated in <span class='it'>444-PS</span>; <span class='it'>1541-PS</span>; <span class='it'>C-167</span>;
<span class='it'>1746-PS</span>. The decisions were made, and the Armed Forces drew
up the plans and executed the attacks. The onslaught was particularly
ruthless against Yugoslavia for the special purpose of
frightening Turkey and Greece. The final deployment instructions
were issued by Brauchitsch (<span class='it'>R-95</span>):
<span class='pageno' title='356' id='Page_356'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“1. The political situation in the Balkans having changed by
reason of the Yugoslav military revolt, Yugoslavia has to
be considered as an enemy even should it make declarations of
loyalty at first.</p>

<p>“<span class='it'>The Fuehrer and Supreme Commander has decided therefore
to destroy Yugoslavia as quickly as possible</span> * * *”</p>

(<span class='it'>R-95</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>e</span>) <span class='it'>The Soviet Union.</span> It is quite possible that some members
of the General Staff and High Command Group opposed “Barbarossa,”
the German attack on the Soviet Union, as unnecessary
and unwise from a military standpoint. Raeder so indicated in
a memorandum he wrote on 10 January 1944 (<span class='it'>C-66</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“1. At this time the Fuehrer had made known his ‘unalterable
decision’ to conduct the Eastern campaign in spite of all
remonstrances. After that, further warnings, if no new situation
had arisen, were found to be completely useless. As
Chief of Naval War Staff, I was never convinced of the
‘compelling necessity’ for Barbarossa.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The Fuehrer very early had the idea of one day settling accounts
with Russia, doubtless his general ideological attitude
played an essential part in this. In 1937-38 he once stated
that he intended to eliminate the Russians as a Baltic power;
they would then have to be diverted in the direction of the
Persian Gulf. The advance of the Russians against Finland
and the Baltic States in 1939-40 probably further strengthened
him in this idea.</p>

<p>“The fear that control of the air over the Channel in the autumn
of 1940 could no longer be attained—a realization which
the Fuehrer, no doubt, gained earlier than the Naval War
Staff, who were not so fully informed of the true results of
air raids on England (our own losses)—surely caused the
Fuehrer, as far back as August and September, to consider
whether—even prior to victory in the West—an Eastern campaign
would be feasible with the object of first eliminating
our last serious opponent on the Continent. The Fuehrer did
not openly express this fear, however, until well into September.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p><span class='pageno' title='357' id='Page_357'></span></p>

<p>“7. As no other course is possible, I have submitted to compulsion.
If, in doing so, a difference of opinion arises between
1 SKL and myself, it is perhaps because the arguments the
Fuehrer used on such occasion (dinner speech in the middle
of July to the Officers in Command) to justify a step he had
planned, usually had a greater effect on people not belonging
to the ‘inner circle,’ than on those who often heard this type
of reasoning.</p>

<p>“Many remarks and plans indicate that the Fuehrer calculated
on the final ending of the Eastern campaign in the autumn
of 1941, whereas the Supreme Command of the Army
(General Staff) was very skeptical.” (<span class='it'>C-66</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>But the passage last quoted indicates that the other members
of the General Staff favored “Barbarossa”. Raeder’s memorandum
actually says substantially what Blomberg’s affidavit (<span class='it'>3704-PS</span>)
says; that some of the generals lost confidence in the power
of Hitler’s judgment, but that the generals failed as a group to
take any definite stand against him although a few tried and suffered
thereby. Certainly the High Command Group took no stand
against Hitler on “Barbarossa” and the events of 1941 and 1942
do not suggest that the High Command embarked on the Soviet
war tentatively or with reservations, but rather with ruthless determination
backed by careful planning. The plans themselves
have already been cited. (<span class='it'>446-PS</span>; <span class='it'>C-35</span>; <span class='it'>872-PS</span>; <span class='it'>C-78</span>; <span class='it'>447-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>f</span>) <span class='it'>Nature of the General Staff and High Command Group
Responsibility for Aggression.</span> The nature of the accusation
against this Group for plotting and launching wars of aggression
must be clearly understood. They are not accused on the ground
that they are soldiers. They are not accused because they did the
usual things a soldier is expected to do, such as make military
plans and command troops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is among the normal duties of a diplomat to engage in negotiations
and conferences; to write notes and side memoires to the
government to which he is accredited; and to cultivate good will
toward the country he represents. Ribbentrop is not indicted for
doing these things. It is the usual function of a politician to weigh
and determine matters of national policy and to draft regulations
and decrees and make speeches. Hess, Frick, and the other politician-defendants
are not indicted for doing these things. It is
an innocent and respectable business to be a locksmith but it
is none the less a crime if the locksmith turns his talents to
picking the locks of neighbors and looting their homes. And that
is the nature of the charge against all the defendants, and against
the General Staff and High Command Group as well. The charge
<span class='pageno' title='358' id='Page_358'></span>
is that in performing the functions of diplomats, politicians, soldiers,
sailors, or whatever they happened to be, they conspired to
and did plan, prepare, initiate, and wage wars of aggression and
in violation of Treaties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Charter (Article 6(a)) declares that wars of aggression
and wars in violation of international treaties, agreements, and
assurances are crimes against peace. It is no defense for those
who commit such crimes to plead that they practice a particular
profession, whether it is arms or the law. It is perfectly legal
for military men to prepare military plans to meet national contingencies,
to carry out such plans and engage in war if in so doing
they do not knowingly plan and wage illegal wars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There might well be individual cases where drawing the line
between legal and illegal conduct would involve some difficulties.
That is not an uncommon situation in the legal field. But there
can be no doubt as to the criminality of the General Staff and High
Command Group, nor as to the guilt of the five defendants who
are members of the Group. The evidence is clear that these defendants,
and the leaders of the Group, and most of the members
of the Group, were fully advised in advance of the aggressive and
illegal war plans, and carried them out with full knowledge that
the wars were aggressive and in violation of treaties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the case of defendants Goering, Keitel, and Jodl, the evidence
is voluminous and their participation in aggressive plans and wars
is constant. The same is true of the defendant Raeder, and his
individual responsibility for the aggressive and savage attack on
Norway and Denmark is especially clear. The evidence so far
offered against Doenitz is less voluminous, for the reason that he
was younger and not one of the top group until later in the war,
but his knowing participation in and advocacy of the Norwegian
venture is clear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Numerous other members of the General Staff and High Command
Group, including its other leaders, participated knowingly
and willfully in these illegal plans and wars. Brauchitsch, the
Commander-in-Chief of the Army, and his Chief of Staff, Halder;
Warlimont the deputy to Jodl and chief repository of plans—in
the nature of things these men knew all that was going on, and
participated fully, as the evidence has shown. Reichenau and
Sperrle helped to bully Schuschnigg; Reichenau and von Schobert,
together with Goering, were immediately sent for by Hitler when
Schuschnigg ordered the plebiscite. At later date, Blaskowitz as
an <span class='it'>Oberbefehlshaber</span> in the field knowingly prepared for the attack
on Poland; Field Marshal List educated the Bulgarians for
their role during the attacks on Yugoslavia and Greece; von Falkenhorst
<span class='pageno' title='359' id='Page_359'></span>
“gladly” accepted the assignment to command the invasion
of Norway and Denmark. On the air side, Jeschonnek had
proposed that Germany attack Norway, Denmark, and Holland,
and simultaneously assured Belgium that there was nothing to
fear. On the naval side, Admiral Carls foresaw at an early date
that German policy was leading to a general European war, and
at a later date the attack on Norway and Denmark was his brainchild;
Krancke was one of the chief planners of this attack; Schniewindt
was in the inner circle for the attack on Poland; Fricke certified
the final orders for “<span class='it'>Weseruebung</span>” and a few months later
proposed that Germany annex Belgium and northern France and
reduce the Netherlands and Scandinavia to vassalage. Most of
these 19 officers were at the time members of the Group, and the
few who were not subsequently became members. At the final
planning and reporting conference for “<span class='it'>Barbarossa</span>,” 17 additional
members were present. At the two meetings with Hitler, at
which the aggressive plans and the contempt for treaties were
fully disclosed, the entire group was present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The military defendants may perhaps argue that military men
are pure technicians, bound to do whatever the political leaders
order them to do. Such a suggestion must fail, on any test of reason
or logic. It amounts to saying that military men are a race
apart from and different from the ordinary run of human beings—men
above and beyond the moral and legal requirements that
apply to others; men incapable of exercising moral judgment on
their own behalf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It stands to reason that the crime of planning and waging aggressive
warfare is committed most consciously, deliberately, and
culpably by a nation’s leaders—the leaders in all the major fields
of activity necessary to and closely involved in the waging of war.
It is committed by the principal propagandists and publicists who
whip up the necessary beliefs and enthusiasms among the people
as a whole, so that the people will acquiesce and join in attacking
and slaughtering the peoples of other nations. It is committed
by the political leaders who purport to represent and execute the
national will. It is committed by the diplomats who handle the
nation’s foreign policy and endeavor to create a favorable diplomatic
setting for successful warfare, and by the chief ministers
who adapt the machinery of government to the needs of a nation
at war. It is committed by the principal industrial and financial
leaders who shape the national economy and marshall the productive
resources for the needs of an aggressive war program. It is
no less committed by the military leaders who knowingly plan aggressive
war, mobilize the men and equipment of the attacking
forces, and execute the actual onslaught.
<span class='pageno' title='360' id='Page_360'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In the nature of things, planning and executing aggressive war
is accomplished by agreement and consultation among all these
types of leaders. If the leaders in any notably important field of
activity stand aside, resist, or fail to cooperate in launching and
executing an aggressive war program, the program will at the very
least be seriously obstructed, and probably its successful accomplishment
will be impossible. That is why the principal leaders
in all these fields of activity share responsibility for the crime, and
the military leaders no less than the others. Leadership in the
military field, as in any other field, calls for moral wisdom as well
as technical astuteness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The responsible military leaders of any nation can hardly be
heard to say that their role is that of a mere janitor, custodian,
or pilot of the war machine which is under their command, and
that they bear no responsibility whatsoever for the use to which
that machine is put. Such a view would degrade and render ignoble
the profession of arms. The prevalence of such a view would
be particularly unfortunate today, when the military leaders control
forces infinitely more powerful and destructive than ever before.
Should the military leaders be declared exempt from the
declaration in the Charter that planning and waging aggressive
war is a crime, it would be a crippling if not fatal blow to the efficacy
of that declaration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The American prosecution here representing the United Nations
believes that the profession of arms is a distinguished and noble
profession. It believes that the practice of that profession by its
leaders calls for the highest degree of integrity and moral wisdom
no less than for technical skill. It believes that in consulting and
planning with leaders in other national fields of activity, the military
leaders will act and counsel in accordance with International
Law and the dictates of the public conscience. Otherwise, the military
resources of the nation will be used, not in accordance with
the laws of modern civilization, but with the law of the jungle.
The military leaders share responsibility with other leaders of a
nation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Obviously the military leaders are not the final and exclusive
arbiters, and the German military leaders do not bear exclusive
responsibility for the aggressive wars which were waged. If the
leading German diplomats and industrialists and other leaders
had not been infected with similar criminal purposes, the German
military leaders might not have had their way. But the German
military leaders conspired with others to undermine and destroy
the conscience of the German nation. The German military leaders
wanted to aggrandize Germany and if necessary to resort to war
<span class='pageno' title='361' id='Page_361'></span>
for that purpose. As the Chief Prosecutor for the United States
said in his opening statement, “the German military leaders are
here before you because they, along with others, mastered Germany
and drove it to war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity.</span> It is proposed
to show that members of the General Staff and High Command
Group, including the five defendants who are members of the
Group, ordered and directed the commission of War Crimes and
Crimes against Humanity, as defined in the Indictment. It is also
proposed to show, in certain instances, the actual commission of
war crimes by members of the German Armed Forces, as a result
of these orders, or as a result of other orders or arrangements
made by members of the General Staff and High Command Group,
which controlled the German Armed Forces and bears responsibility
for war crimes committed by them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not proposed, however, to make a full showing of war
crimes committed by the German Armed Forces. The full presentation
of this evidence is to be made, pursuant to agreement among
the Chief Prosecutors, by the French and Soviet delegations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It will be shown that the General Staff and High Command became
wedded to a policy of terror. In some cases, where the evidence
of this policy is in documentary form, the activating papers
which were signed by, initialed by, and circulated among the members
of the Group will be presented. In other instances, where
the actual crimes were committed by others than members of the
German Armed Forces (where, for example prisoners of war or
civilians were handed over to and mistreated or murdered by the
SS or SD), it will be shown that members of the Group were well
aware that they were assisting in the commission of war crimes.
It will be shown that many crimes committed by the SS or SD
were committed with the knowledge and necessary support of
the General Staff and High Command, and that frequently members
of the German Armed Forces acted in conjunction with the
SS and SD in carrying out tasks then known by such respectable-sounding
terms as “pacification,” “cleansing,” and “elimination
of insecure elements.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) <span class='it'>Murder of Commandos, Paratroopers, and Members of Military
Missions.</span> This story starts with an order issued by Hitler on
18 October 1942 (<span class='it'>498-PS</span>). The order began with a recital that
allied commandos were using methods of warfare alleged to be
outside the scope of the Geneva Conventions, and thereafter proceeded
to specify the methods of warfare which German troops
should use against allied commandos, and the disposition which
<span class='pageno' title='362' id='Page_362'></span>
should be made of captured commandos. This order reads as
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>“1.</span><p class='listPara'>For some time our enemies have been using in their
warfare methods which are outside the international
Geneva Conventions. Especially brutal and treacherous
is the behavior of the so-called commandos, who, as is
established, are partially recruited even from freed criminals
in enemy countries. From captured orders it is divulged
that they are directed not only to shackle prisoners,
but also to kill defenseless prisoners on the spot at
the moment in which they believe that the latter as prisoners
represent a burden in the further pursuit of their
purposes or could otherwise be a hindrance. Finally,
orders have been found in which the killing of prisoners
has been demanded in principle.</p>
</div>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>“2.</span><p class='listPara'>For this reason it was already announced in an addendum
to the Armed Forces report of 7 October 1942, that
in the future, Germany, in the face of these sabotage
troops of the British and their accomplices, will resort
to the same procedure, i.e., that they will be ruthlessly
mowed down by the German troops in combat, wherever
they may appear.</p>
</div>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>“3.</span><p class='listPara'>I therefore order:<br/> From now on all enemies on so-called Commando missions
in Europe or Africa challenged by German troops,
even if they are to all appearances soldiers in uniform or
demolition troops, whether armed or unarmed, in battle
or in flight, are to be slaughtered to the last man. It
does not make any difference whether they are landed
from ships and aeroplanes for their actions, or whether
they are dropped by parachute. Even if these individuals,
when found, should apparently be prepared to give themselves
up, no pardon is to be granted them on principle. In
each individual case full information is to be sent to the
OKW for publication in the Report of the Military
Forces.</p>

agents, saboteurs, etc. fall into the hands of the military
forces by some other means, through the police in

over immediately to the SD. Any imprisonment under
military guard, in PW stockades for instance, etc., is
strictly prohibited, even if this is only intended for a
short time.

falling into our hands after battles at sea, or enemy soldiers

<p>“I have been compelled to issue strict orders for the destruction
of enemy sabotage troops and to declare noncompliance
with these orders severely punishable. I deem it necessary
to announce to the competent commanding officers and commanders
the reasons for this decree.
<span class='pageno' title='364' id='Page_364'></span></p>

<p>“As in no previous war, a method of destruction of communications
behind the front, intimidation of the populace working
for Germany, as well as the destruction of war-important
industrial plants in territories occupied by us has been developed
in this war.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The consequences of these activities are of extraordinary
weight. I do not know whether each commander and officer
is cognizant of the fact that the destruction of one single electric
power plant, for instance, can deprive the <span class='it'>Luftwaffe</span> of
many thousand tons of aluminum, thereby eliminating the
construction of countless aircraft that will be missed in the
fight at the front and so contribute to serious damage of the
Homeland as well as bloody losses of the fighting soldiers.</p>

<p>“Yet this form of war is completely without danger for the
adversary. Since he lands his sabotage troops in uniform
but at the same time supplies them with civilian clothes, they
can, according to need, appear as soldiers or civilians. While
they themselves have orders to ruthlessly remove any German
soldiers or even natives who get in their way, they run no
danger of suffering really serious losses in their operations,
since at the worst, if they are caught, they can immediately
surrender and thus believe that they will theoretically fall
under the provisions of the Geneva Convention. There is no
doubt, however, that this is a misuse in the worst form of the
Geneva agreements, especially since part of these elements
are even criminals, liberated from prisons, who can rehabilitate
themselves through these activities.</p>

<p>“England and America will therefore always be able to find
volunteers for this kind of warfare as long as they can truthfully
assure them that there is no danger of loss of life for
them. At worse, all they have to do is to successfully commit
their attack on people, traffic installations, or other installations,
and upon being encountered by the enemy, to
capitulate.</p>

<p>“If the German conduct of war is not to suffer grievous damage
through these incidents, it must be made clear to the adversary
that all sabotage troops will be exterminated, without
exception, to the last man.</p>

<p>“This means that their chance of escaping with their lives
is nil. Under no circumstances can it be permitted, therefore,
that a dynamite, sabotage, or terrorist unit simply allows
itself to be captured, expecting to be treated according
<span class='pageno' title='365' id='Page_365'></span>
to rules of the Geneva Convention. It must under all circumstances
be ruthlessly exterminated.</p>

<p>“The report on this subject appearing in the Armed Forces
communique will briefly and laconically state that a sabotage,
terror, or destruction unit has been encountered and exterminated
to the last man.</p>

<p>“I therefore expect the commanding officers of armies subordinated
to them as well as individual commanders not only to
realize the necessity of taking such measures, but to carry
out this order with all energy. Officers and noncommissioned
officers who fail through some weakness are to be reported
without fail, or under circumstances when there is danger in
delay to be at once made strictly accountable. The Homeland
as well as the fighting soldier at the front has the right to
expect that behind their back the essentials of nourishment
as well as the supply of war-important weapons and ammunition
remains secure.</p>

<p>“These are the reasons for the issuance of this decree.</p>

<p>“If it should become necessary, for reasons of interrogation,
to initially spare one man or two, then they are to be shot
immediately after interrogation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ten days later, on 28 October 1942, while Raeder was Commander-in-Chief
of the Germany Navy, the Naval War Staff in
Berlin transmitted its copy of the basic order of 18 October to the
lower Naval commands. The copy distributed by the Navy and

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 11 February 1943, just twelve days after Doenitz had become
Commander-in-Chief of the German Navy, the Naval War
Staff promulgated a further memorandum on this subject in order
to clear up certain misunderstandings as to the scope of the basic
order of 18 October 1942 (<span class='it'>C-178</span>). It was stated in this subsequent
memorandum that all commanders and officers who neglected their
duty in failing to instruct their units concerning the order would
run the risk of serious court martial penalties:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“From the notice given by 3/SKL [Naval War Staff] on February
1st 43, it has been discovered that the competent departments
of the General Staff of the Army, as well as those
of the Air Force Operations Staff have a wrong conception
regarding the treatment of saboteurs. A telephone inquiry at
3/SKL proved that this Naval authority was not correctly
informed either. In view of this situation, reference is made
to figure <span class='it'>6</span> of the Fuehrer order of October 18, 42 (Appendix
to Volume No. 1 SKL 1 Ops 26 367/42 Top Secret of October
28, 42) according to which all commanders and officers, who
have neglected their duty in instructing their units about the
order referring to treatment of saboteurs, are threatened
with punishment by court martial.</p>

<p>“The first Fuehrer order concerning this matter of October
18, 42 (Appendix to Volume No. 1 SKL 1 Ops 2108/42 Top
Secret of October 27, 42) was given the protection of Top
Secret merely because it is stated therein:</p>

<p>“1. That, according to the Fuehrer’s views the spreading of
military sabotage organizations in the East <span class='it'>and</span> West may
have portentous consequences for our whole conduct of the
war and</p>

<p>“2. That the shooting of uniformed prisoners acting on military
orders must be carried out even <span class='it'>after</span> they have surrendered
voluntarily and asked for pardon.</p>

<p>“On the other hand, the annihilation of sabotage units in
battle is not at all to be kept secret but on the contrary to be
currently published in the OKW (Supreme Command of the
Armed Forces) reports. The purpose of these measures to
act as a deterrent, will not be achieved, if those taking part
in enemy ‘Commando Operations’ would not learn that certain
death and not safe imprisonment awaits them. As the
saboteurs are to be annihilated immediately, unless their statements
are first needed for military reasons, it is necessary
that not only all members of the Armed Forces must receive
<span class='pageno' title='367' id='Page_367'></span>
instructions that these types of saboteurs, even if they are in
uniform, are to be annihilated, but also all departments of
the home staff, dealing with this kind of question, must be
informed of the course of action which has been ordered.”

<p class='pindent'>The Hitler order of October 1942 was actually carried out in a
number of instances. During the night of the 19-20 November
1942, a British freight glider crashed near Egersund in Norway.
The glider carried a British commando unit of 17 men, of whom
3 were apparently killed in the crash. All were in English uniform.
The 14 survivors were executed in accordance with the
Hitler order in the evening of 20 November 1942. The proof is

<p>“On November 20, 1942 at 5:50 an enemy plane was found
15 Km NE of Egersund. It is a British aircraft (towed
glider) made of wood without engine. Of the 17 member
crew 3 are dead, 6 are severely, the others slightly
wounded.</p>

<p>“All wore English khaki uniforms without sleeve-insignia.
Furthermore following items were found: 8 knapsacks, tents,
skis and radio sender, exact number is unknown. The glider
carried rifles, light machine guns and machine pistols, number
unknown. At present the prisoners are with the Bn. in Egersund.”</p>

<p>“Beside the 17 member crew extensive sabotage material and
work equipment were found. Therefore the sabotage purpose
was absolutely proved. The 280th Inf. Div. (J.D.) ordered
the execution of the action according to the Fuehrer’s order.
The execution was carried out toward the evening of Nov.
20. Some of the prisoners wore blue ski-suits under their
khaki uniforms which had no insignia on the sleeves. During
a short interrogation the survivors have revealed nothing but
their names, ranks and serial numbers.”</p>

<p>“In connection with the shooting of the 17 members of the
crew, the Armed Forces Commander of Norway (WBN)
has issued an order to the district commanders, according to
which the interrogation by G-2 (Ic) and by BDS are important
before the execution of the Fuehrer order; in case
of No. 4 of the Fuehrer order the prisoners are to be handed
over to the BDS.” (<span class='it'>508-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In three specific instances the Hitler order was carried out in
Norway (<span class='it'>512-PS</span>). The procedure was to take individual commandos
prisoner and interrogate them to extract military intelligence
before executing them. This procedure was in accordance
with the last sentence of Hitler’s supplementary order (<span class='it'>503-PS</span>),
and is obviously in flat contradiction of the requirements of the
Hague and Geneva Conventions. The reason for this procedure
is explained as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“<span class='it'>TOP SECRET</span>—According to the last sentence of the
Fuehrer order of 18th October (<span class='it'>CHEFS</span>), individual saboteurs
can be spared for the time being in order to keep them
for interrogation. The importance of this measure was proven
in the cases of Glomfjord, Twoman torpedo Drontheim, and
glider plane Stavanger, where interrogations resulted in valuable
knowledge of enemy intentions. Since in the case of
Egersund the saboteur was liquidated immediately and no
clues were won; therefore, Armed Forces Commander (WB)
referred to above mentioned (OA) last sentence of the Fuehrer
order (Liquidation only after short interrogation).”
(<span class='it'>512-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another instance from the Norwegian theater of war (<span class='it'>526-PS</span>):
On 30 March 1943, 10 Norwegian navy personnel were taken
prisoner from a Norwegian cutter at Toftefjord. The 10 prisoners
were executed by the SD in accordance with the Hitler
order, but the published report announced only that the unit was
destroyed:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“On the 30.3 1943 in Toftefjord (70° Lat.) an enemy cutter

<p class='pindent'>Similar action took place in the Italian theater. A telegram
(<span class='it'>509-PS</span>) from the Supreme Commander in Italy to OKW, dated 7
November 1943, shows that on 2 November 1943 three British
commandos captured at Pascara, Italy, were given “special treatment”
(<span class='it'>Sonderbehandelt</span>), which, as previous evidence has shown,
(<span class='it'>3040-PS</span>) means death. What happened to the remaining nine

<p class='pindent'>An affidavit (<span class='it'>2610-PS</span>) dated 7 November 1945, by Frederick
W. Roche, a Major in the Army of the United States, furnishes
other evidence of the carrying out of the Hitler order. Major
Roche was the Judge Advocate of an American Military Commission
which tried General Anton Dostler, formerly Commander of
the 75th German Army Corps, for the unlawful execution of 15
members of the United States Armed Forces. His affidavit states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“FREDERICK W. ROCHE being duly sworn deposes and
says:</p>

<p>“I am a Major in the Army of the United States.</p>

<p>“I was the Judge Advocate of the Military Commission which
tried Anton Dostler for ordering the execution of the group
of fifteen United States Army personnel who comprised the
‘Ginny Mission.’ This Military Commission consisting of five
officers was appointed by command of General McNarney,
by Special Orders No. 269, dated 26 September 1945, Headquarters,
Mediterranean Theater of Operations, United States
Army, APO 512.</p>

<p>“The Military Commission met at Rome, Italy, on 8 October
1945 and proceeded with the trial of the case of the United
States v. Anton Dostler. The trial of this case consumed
four days and the findings and sentence were announced on
the morning of 12 October 1945. The charge and specification
in this case are as follows:</p>

<p>“ ‘Charge: Violation of the law of war.’</p>

<p>“ ‘Specification: In that Anton Dostler, then General, commanding
military forces of the German Reich, a belligerent

24 March 1944, in the vicinity of La Spezia, Italy, contrary

<p>“I was present throughout the entire proceeding. I heard
all the testimony, and I am familiar with the record in this
case. The facts developed in this proceeding are as follows:
On the night of 22 March 1944, two officers and thirteen enlisted
men of the 2677th Special Reconnaissance Battalion
of the Army of the United States disembarked from some
United States Navy boats and landed on the Italian coast
near Stazione di Framura. All fifteen men were members
of the Army of the United States and were in the military
service of the United States. When they landed on the
Italian coast they were all properly dressed in the field uniform
of the United States Army and they carried no civilian
clothes. Their mission was to demolish a railroad tunnel on
the main line between La Spezia and Genoa. That rail line
was being used by the German Forces to supply their fighting
forces on the Cassino and Anzio Beachhead fronts. The
entire group was captured on the morning of 24 March 1944
by a patrol consisting of Fascist soldiers and a group of
members of the German Army. All fifteen men were placed
under interrogation in La Spezia and they were held in custody
until the morning of 26 March 1944 when they were
all executed by a firing squad. These men were never tried
nor were they brought before any court or given any hearing;
they were shot by order of Anton Dostler, then General
Commanding the 75th German Army Corps.</p>

<p>“Anton Dostler took the stand in this case and testified by
way of defense that he ordered the fifteen American soldiers
to be shot pursuant to the Hitler order of 18 October 1942 on
commando operations, which provided that commandos were
to be shot and not taken prisoners of war, even after they
had been interrogated. He also testified that he would have
been subject to court martial proceedings if he did not obey
the Hitler order.</p>

<p>“The following is a true copy of the findings and sentence
in the case of the United States v. Anton Dostler, as these
findings and sentence appear in the original record of the
trial and as they were announced in open court at Rome,
Italy on 12 October 1945:

<p class='pindent'>The order of 18 October 1942 remained in force, so far as the
evidence shows, until the end of the war. On 22 June 1944 in a
document initialed by Warlimont (<span class='it'>506-PS</span>) the OKW made it clear
that the Hitler order was to be applied even in cases where the
commando operation was undertaken by only one person:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“WFSt agrees with the view taken in the letter of the army
group judge [<span class='it'>Heeresgruppenrichter</span>] with the Supreme Commander
Southwest of 20 May 44 (Br. B. Nr 68/44 g.K.).
The Fuehrer order is to be applied even if the enemy employs
only <span class='it'>one</span> person for a task. Therefore, it does not make any
difference if several persons or a single person take part in a
commando operation. The reason for the special treatment
of participants in a commando operation is that such operations
do not correspond to the German concept of usage and
customs of (land) warfare.” (<span class='it'>506-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The allied landing in Normandy early in June 1944, in the
course of which large scale air-borne operations took place, raised
among the Germans the question as to how far the Hitler order
would be applied to Normandy, and in France behind the German
lines. A memorandum (<span class='it'>531-PS</span>) dated 23 June 1944 and signed
by Warlimont, starts by quoting a teletype from the Supreme
Command in the West inquiring what should be done about applying
the Hitler order to air-borne troops and commandos:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Supreme Command West reports by teletype message No.
1750/44 Top Secret of 23 June 44:</p>

<p>“The treatment of enemy commando groups has so far been
carried out according to the order referred to. With the large-scale
landing achieved, a new situation has arisen. The order
referred to directs in number 5 that enemy soldiers who are
taken prisoner in open combat or surrender within the limits
of normal combat operations (large-scale landing operations
and undertakings) are not to be treated according to numbers
<span class='pageno' title='372' id='Page_372'></span>
3 and 4. It must be established in a form easily understood
by the troops how far the concept ‘within the limits of
normal combat operations, etc.’ is to be extended.</p>

<p>“The application of number 5 for all enemy <span class='it'>soldiers in uniform</span>
penetrating from the outside into the occupied western
areas is held by Supreme Command West to be the most correct
and clearest solution.” (<span class='it'>531-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Warlimont’s memorandum (<span class='it'>531-PS</span>) continues by reciting the
position taken with reference to the request by the OKW Operations
Staff, of which Warlimont was the Deputy Chief:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“<span class='it'>Position taken by Armed Forces Operational Staff</span>:</p>

<p>“1. The Commando order remains basically in effect even
after the enemy landing in the west.</p>

<p>“2. Number 5 of the order is to be clarified to the effect, that
the order is not valid for <span class='it'>those</span> enemy soldiers in uniform,
who are captured in open combat in the immediate combat
area of the beachhead by our troops committed there, or who
surrender. Our troops committed in the immediate combat
area means the divisions fighting on the front line as well as
reserves up to and including corps headquarters.</p>

<p>“3. Furthermore, in doubtful cases enemy personnel who have
fallen into our hands alive are to be turned over to the SD,
upon whom it is encumbent to determine whether the Commando
order is to be applied or not.</p>

<p>“4. Supreme Command West is to see to it that all units
committed in its zone are orally acquainted in a suitable
manner with the order concerning the treatment of members
of commando undertakings of 18 Oct. 42 along with the
above explanation.” (<span class='it'>531-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 25 June 1944 the OKW replied to this inquiry in a teletype
message (<span class='it'>551-PS</span>) signed by Keitel and initialed by Warlimont
and Jodl:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“<span class='it'>Subject</span>: Treatment of Commando Participants.</p>

<p>“1. Even after the landing of Anglo-Americans in France,
the order of the Fuehrer on the destruction of terror and
sabotage units of 18 Oct. 1942 remains fully in force.</p>

<p>“Enemy soldiers in uniform in the immediate combat area
of the bridgehead, that is, in the area of the divisions fighting
in the most forward lines as well as of the reserves up to
the Corps Commands, according to No. 5 of the basic order
of 18 Oct. 1942, remain exempted.</p>

<p>“2. All members of terror and sabotage units, found outside
the immediate combat area, who include fundamentally all
<span class='pageno' title='373' id='Page_373'></span>
parachutists, are to be killed in combat. In special cases, they
are to be turned over to the SD.</p>

<p>“3. All troops, committed outside the combat area of Normandy,
are to be informed about the duty to destroy enemy
terror and sabotage units briefly and succinctly according to
the directives, issued for it.</p>

<p>“4. Supreme Commander West will report immediately daily,
how many saboteurs have been liquidated in this manner.
This applies especially also to undertakings by the military
commanders. The number is to be published daily in the Armed
Forces Communique to exercise a frightening effect, as has
already been done toward previous commando undertakings
in the same manners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In July 1944, the question was raised within the German High
Command as to whether the order of October 1942 should be
applied to members of foreign military missions, with special regard
to the British, American, and Soviet military missions which
were cooperating with allied forces in Southeastern Europe,
notably in Yugoslavia. A long document signed by Warlimont
(<span class='it'>1279-PS</span>) embodies the discussions which were had at that time
at OKW. It discloses that the Armed Forces Operational Staff
recommended that the order should be applied to these military
missions and drew up a draft order to this effect. The order
which actually resulted from these discussions (<span class='it'>537-PS</span>), dated
30 July 1944 and signed by Keitel, provides:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pursuant to this order, approximately 15 members of an allied
<span class='pageno' title='374' id='Page_374'></span>
military mission to Slovakia were executed in January 1945. An
affidavit (<span class='it'>L-51</span>) signed by one Adolf Zutter, who was the adjutant
at the camp where the executions took place, reads in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Concerning the American Military Mission which had
landed behind the German main line of resistance in Slovakian
or Hungarian territory in January 1945, I remember
when in January 1945 it was brought to the concentration
camp at Mauthausen. I suppose there were about 12 to 15
newcomers. They wore an American or Canadian uniform,
of brown-green color, blouse, and cap made of cloth. Eight
or ten days after their arrival the order for execution came
in by radiogram or teletype. Colonel Ziereis came to me in
the office and said: now Kaltenbrunner has authorized the
execution. The letter was secret and had the signature: signed
Kaltenbrunner. These people were then shot according to
martial law and T/Sgt [<span class='it'>Oberscharfuehrer</span>] Niedermeyer
handed their belongings over to me. In spring 1945, a written
order based on an Army manual to destroy all files was received
by the security officer in Mauthausen, 1st Lt. [<span class='it'>Obersturmfuehrer</span>]
Reimer; this order had been sent by Lt. [<span class='it'>Untersturmfuehrer</span>]
Meinhardt, security officer of Section D in
Oranienburg. Reimer forwarded this order personally in
written form to the various sections and supervised the compliance
with it. Among the files were also all the execution
orders.” (<span class='it'>L-51</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The foregoing documents with respect to the order of 18 October
1942, and its subsequent enforcement and application, clearly
demonstrate that members of the General Staff and High Command
Group, including the defendants Keitel, Jodl, Doenitz, and
Raeder, ordered and directed the commission of war crimes by
members of the German Armed Forces, and that these orders
were carried out in numerous instances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) <span class='it'>War Crimes on the Eastern Front.</span> The order of October
1942 with respect to the murdering of captured commandos operated
chiefly in the Western theater of war, against British and
American commando troops. This was natural since Germany
occupied almost the entire Western coast of Europe from 1940
until the last year of the war, and during that period land fighting
in Western Europe was largely limited to commando operations.
The Mediterranean Theater likewise lent itself to this type
of warfare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the Eastern Front, where there was large-scale land fighting
in Poland and the Soviet Union from 1941 on, the German
forces were fighting amongst a hostile population and had to
<span class='pageno' title='375' id='Page_375'></span>
face extensive partisan activities behind their lines. It will be
shown that the activities of the German Armed Forces against
partisans and other elements of the population became a vehicle
for carrying out Nazi political and racial policies, and a cloak for
the ruthless and barbaric massacre of Jews and of numerous
segments of the Slavic population which were regarded by the
Nazis as undesirable. It was the policy of the German Armed
Forces to behave with the utmost severity to the civilian population
of the occupied territories, and to conduct its military operations,
particularly against partisans, so as to further these Nazi
policies. It will be shown that the German Armed Forces supported,
assisted, and acted in cooperation with the SS Groups
which were especially charged with anti-partisan activities. Members
of the General Staff and High Command Group ordered, directed,
encouraged, and were fully aware of these criminal policies
and activities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not proposed to make a full or even partial showing of war
crimes committed by the Nazis on the Eastern Front; evidence of
those crimes are to be presented by the Soviet delegation. Evidence
concerning the activities of the SS, SD, and Gestapo will
be discussed only to the extent necessary to clarify the relations
between these organizations and the German Armed Forces and
to demonstrate their close collaboration in the occupied territories
of Eastern Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These policies of ruthless severity to the civilian population
of the occupied Eastern territories were determined upon and
made official for the German Armed Forces even before the invasion
of the Soviet Union took place. An order by Hitler, dated
13 May 1941, and signed by Keitel as Chief of the Supreme Command
of the Armed Forces (<span class='it'>C-50</span>) provided:</p>

<p>“The fact that the operational areas in the East are so farflung,

Battalion Commander, <span class='it'>collective despotic measures</span> will be
taken without delay against <span class='it'>localities</span> from which cunning or
malicious attacks are made on the Armed Forces, if circumstances
do not permit of a quick identification of individual
offenders.</p>

<p>“5. It is <span class='it'>expressly forbidden</span> to <span class='it'>keep</span> suspects <span class='it'>in custody</span> in
order to hand them over to the courts after the reinstatement
of civil courts.</p>

<p>“6. The C-in-Cs of the Army Groups may by agreement with
the competent Naval and Air Force Commanders reintroduce
<span class='it'>military jurisdiction for civilians</span>, in areas which are
sufficiently settled.</p>

<p>“For the <span class='it'>area of the</span> ‘<span class='it'>Political Administration</span>’ this order will
be given by the Chief of the Supreme Command of the Armed
Forces.</p>

<p>“II. <span class='it'>Treatment of offences committed against inhabitants by
members of the Armed Forces and its employees.</span></p>

<p>“1. With regard to offences committed against enemy civilians
by members of the Wehrmacht and its employees <span class='it'>prosecution
is not obligatory</span> even where the deed is at the same
time a military crime or offence.</p>

<p>“2. When judging such offences, it must be borne in mind,
<span class='pageno' title='377' id='Page_377'></span>
whatever the circumstances, that the collapse of Germany in
1918, the subsequent sufferings of the German people and
the fight against National Socialism which cost the blood of
innumerable supporters of the movement, were caused primarily
by Bolshevik influence and that no German has forgotten
this fact.</p>

<p>“3. Therefore the judicial authority will decide in such cases
whether a disciplinary penalty is indicated, or whether <span class='it'>legal
measures</span> are necessary. In the case of offences against inhabitants
it will order a <span class='it'>court martial</span> only if <span class='it'>maintenance of
discipline</span> or <span class='it'>security of the Forces</span> call for such a measure.
This applies for instance to serious offences originating in
lack of self control in sexual matters, or in a criminal disposition,
and to those which indicate that the troops are threatening
to get out of hand. Offences which have resulted in
senseless destruction of billets or stores or other captured
material to the disadvantage of our Forces should as a rule
be judged no less severely.</p>

<p>“<span class='it'>The order to institute proceedings</span> requires in every single
case the signature of the Judicial Authority.</p>

<p>“4. <span class='it'>Extreme caution</span> is indicated in assessing the credibility
of statements made by enemy civilians.</p>

<p>“III. <span class='it'>Responsibility of the Military Commanders.</span></p>

<p>“Within their sphere of competence Military Commanders are
<span class='it'>personally</span> responsible for seeing that:</p>

<p>“1. Every commissioned officer of the units under their command
is instructed promptly and in the most emphatic manner
on principles set out under I above.</p>

<p>“2. Their legal advisers are notified promptly of these instructions
and of <span class='it'>verbal information in which the political
intentions of the High Command were explained to C-in-Cs</span>.</p>

<p>“3. Only those court sentences are confirmed which are in
accordance with the political intentions of the High Command.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Less than three months after the invasion of the Soviet Union,
these instructions were amplified and made even more drastic.
An order dated 16 September 1941 and signed by Keitel, was widely
<span class='pageno' title='378' id='Page_378'></span>
distributed (<span class='it'>C-148</span>). This order was of general application in
all theaters of war, but was clearly of primary importance for
the Eastern Front:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“<span class='it'>Subject</span>: Communist Insurrection in occupied territories.</p>

<p>“1. Since the beginning of the campaign against Soviet Russia,
Communist insurrection movements have broken out
everywhere in the areas occupied by Germany. The type of
action taken is growing from propaganda measures and attacks
on individual members of the Armed Forces, into open
rebellion and widespread guerilla warfare.</p>

<p>“It can be seen that this is a <span class='it'>mass movement centrally directed
by Moscow</span>, who is also responsible for the apparently
trivial isolated incidents in areas which up to now have been
otherwise quiet.</p>

<p>“In view of the many political and economic crises in the
occupied areas, it must, moreover, be anticipated, that <span class='it'>nationalist
and other circles</span> will make full use of this opportunity
of making difficulties for the German occupying forces
by associating themselves with the Communist insurrection.</p>

<p>“This creates an increasing <span class='it'>danger to the German war effort</span>,
which shows itself chiefly in general insecurity for the occupying
troops, and has already led to the withdrawal of forces
to the main centers of disturbance.</p>

<p>“2. <span class='it'>The measures taken up to now</span> to deal with general insurrection
movement <span class='it'>have proved inadequate</span>. The Fuehrer
has now given orders that we take action <span class='it'>everywhere with
the most drastic means</span> in order to crush the movement in
the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>“Only this course, which has always been followed successfully
throughout the history of the extension of influence of
great peoples, can restore order.</p>

<p>“3. Action taken in this matter should be in accordance with
the following <span class='it'>general directions</span>:</p>

<p>“<span class='it'>a.</span> It should be inferred, in <span class='it'>every case</span> of resistance to the
German occupying Forces, no matter what the individual
circumstances, that it is of <span class='it'>Communist origin</span>.</p>

<p>“<span class='it'>b.</span> In order to nip these machinations in the bud, the most
drastic measures should be taken immediately on <span class='it'>the first
indication</span>, so that the authority of the occupying Forces may
be maintained, and further spreading prevented. In this
connection it should be remembered that a human life in
unsettled countries frequently counts for nothing and a deterrent
effect can be attained only by unusual severity. The
<span class='pageno' title='379' id='Page_379'></span>
death penalty for 50-100 Communists should generally be
regarded in these cases as suitable atonement for one German
soldier’s life. The way in which sentence is carried out
should still further increase the deterrent effect.</p>

<p>“The reverse course of action, that of imposing relatively
lenient penalties, and of being content, for purposes of deterrence,
with the threat of more severe measures, does not
accord with these principles and should therefore not be
followed.”</p>

<p>“4. <span class='it'>The Commanding Officers in the occupied territories</span> are
seeing to it that these principles are made known without
delay to all military establishments concerned in dealing with
Communist measures of insurrection.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German military leaders took up, sponsored, and instructed
their troops to practice the racial policies of the Nazis.
On 10 October 1941 a directive was issued by Field Marshal von
Reichenau, the Commander-in-Chief (<span class='it'>Oberbefehlshaber</span>) of the
German 8th Army, then operating on the Eastern Front (<span class='it'>UK-81</span>).
Reichenau (who died in 1942) was therefore a member of the
group, and here is what he had to say:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Subject: Conduct of Troops in Eastern Territories.</p>

<p>“Regarding the conduct of troops towards the bolshevistic
system, vague ideas are still prevalent in many cases. The
most essential aim of war against the Jewish-bolshevistic
system is a complete destruction of their means of power and
the elimination of Asiatic influence from the European culture.
In this connection the troops are facing tasks which
exceed the one-sided routine of soldiering. The soldier in the
eastern territories is not merely a fighter according to the
rules of the art of war but also a bearer of ruthless national
ideology and the avenger of bestialities which have been inflicted
upon German and racially related nations.</p>

<p>“Therefore the soldier must have full understanding for the
necessity of a severe but just revenge on subhuman Jewry.
The Army has to aim at another purpose, i.e., the annihilation
of revolts in hinterland which, as experience proves, have
always been caused by Jews.</p>

<p>“The combatting of the enemy behind the front line is still
not being taken seriously enough. Treacherous, cruel partisans
and unnatural women are still being made prisoners of
war and guerilla fighters dressed partly in uniforms or plain
<span class='pageno' title='380' id='Page_380'></span>
clothes and vagabonds are still being treated as proper soldiers,
and sent to prisoner of war camps. In fact, captured
Russian officers talk even mockingly about Soviet agents moving
openly about the roads and very often eating at German
field kitchens. Such an attitude of the troops can only be
explained by complete thoughtlessness, so it is now high
time for the commanders to clarify the meaning of the present
struggle.</p>

<p>“The feeding of the natives and of prisoners of war who are
not working for the Armed Forces from Army kitchens is
an equally misunderstood humanitarian act as is the giving of
cigarettes and bread. Things which the people at home can
spare under great sacrifices and things which are being
brought by the Command to the front under great difficulties,
should not be given to the enemy by the soldier not even
if they originate from booty. It is an important part of our
supply.</p>

<p>“When retreating the Soviets have often set buildings on fire.
The troops should be interested in extinguishing of fires only
as far as it is necessary to secure sufficient numbers of billets.
Otherwise the disappearance of symbols of the former bolshevistic
rule even in the form of buildings is part of the
struggle of destruction. Neither historic nor artistic considerations
are of any importance in the eastern territories.
The command issues the necessary directives for the securing
of raw materials and plants, essential for war economy. The
complete disarming of the civil population in the rear of the
fighting troops is imperative considering the long and vulnerable
lines of communications. Where possible, captured
weapons and ammunition should be stored and guarded.
Should this be impossible because of the situation of the battle
so the weapons and ammunition will be rendered useless. If
isolated partisans are found using firearms in the rear of
the army drastic measures are to be taken. These measures
will be extended to that part of the male population who were
in a position to hinder or report the attacks. The indifference
of numerous apparently anti-Soviet elements which originates
from a ‘wait and see’ attitude, must give way to a clear
decision for active collaboration. If not, no one can complain
about being judges and treated a member of the Soviet
System.</p>

<p>“The fear of the German countermeasures must be stronger
than the threats of the wandering bolshevistic remnants.
Being far from all political considerations of the future the
soldier has to fulfill two tasks:
<span class='pageno' title='381' id='Page_381'></span></p>

<p>“1. <span class='it'>Complete annihilation of the false bolshevistic doctrine of
the Soviet State and its armed forces.</span></p>

<p>“2. <span class='it'>The pitiless extermination of foreign treachery and
cruelty and thus the protection of the lives of military personnel
in Russia.</span></p>

<p>“This is the only way to fulfill our historic task to liberate the
German people once for ever from the Asiatic-Jewish danger.</p>

</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately preceding Reichenau’s order is a memorandum,
dated 28 October 1941, which shows that Reichenau’s order met
with Hitler’s approval and was thereafter circulated by order
of the Commander-in-Chief of the German Army. It is also clear
that Reichenau’s order was thereafter circulated down to divisional
level, and was received by the 12th Infantry Division on 27 November
1941. (<span class='it'>UK-81</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>These being the directives and policies prescribed by the German
military leaders, it is no wonder that the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> joined
in the monstrous behavior of the SS and SD on the Eastern Front.
Units (known as <span class='it'>Einsatzgruppen</span>) were formed by the SIPO and
SD and sent out to operate in and behind the operational areas on
the Eastern Front, in order to combat partisans and to “cleanse”
and “pacify” the civilian population.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a directive dated 19 March 1943, the Commanding Officer of
one of these units praised and justified such activities as the shooting
of Hungarian Jews, the shooting of children, and the total
burning down of villages (<span class='it'>3012-PS</span>). The officer directed that in
order not to obstruct the procuring of slave labor for the German
armament industry,</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“as a rule no more children will be shot” (<span class='it'>3012-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p>A report covering the work of the <span class='it'>Einsatzgruppen</span> in the German
occupied territories of the Soviet Union during the month of
October 1941 disregards every vestige of decency (<span class='it'>R-102</span>). It
states cynically that, in the Baltic areas,</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“spontaneous demonstrations against Jewry followed by pogroms
on the part of the population against the remaining
Jews have not been recorded, on account of the lack of adequate
indoctrination” (<span class='it'>R-102</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This report shows clearly that “pacification” and “anti-partisan
activity” are mere code words for “extermination of Jews and
Slavs” just as much as “<span class='it'>Weserubung</span>” was a code word for the
invasion and subjugation of Norway and Denmark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Documents quoted earlier show that the German Army was
<span class='pageno' title='382' id='Page_382'></span>
operating under similar policies and directives. It only remains
to show that, in these practices, the Army and the SS worked
hand in glove. The report describing the destruction of the Warsaw
Ghetto (<span class='it'>1061-PS</span>) stresses the close cooperation between the
SS and the Army:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The longer the resistance lasted, the tougher the men of the
<span class='it'>Waffen SS</span>, Police and <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> became; they fulfilled their
duty indefatigably in faithful comradeship and stood together
as models and examples of soldiers. Their duty hours
often lasted from early morning until late at night. At night,
search patrols with rags wound round their feet remained
at the heels of the Jews and gave them no respite. Not infrequently
they caught and killed Jews who used the night
hours for supplementing their stores from abandoned dugouts
and for contacting neighboring groups or exchanging
news with them.” (1061-PS)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>To the same general effect is a report dated 5 June 1943 by
the German General Commissioner for Minsk (<span class='it'>R-135</span>). This report
describes an anti-partisan operation in which 4,500 “enemies”
were killed, 5,000 suspected partisans were killed, and 59
Germans were killed. The cooperation in this adventure by the
German Army is shown in the following excerpt:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The above mentioned figures show, that we have to count
with a strong annihilation of the population. The fact that
only 492 rifles were found on the 4,500 enemy dead, demonstrates
that the numerous peasants from the country were
also among the enemy dead. The battalion <span class='it'>Direwanger</span> is
particularly known to have destroyed numerous human lives.
Among the 5,000 partisan suspects who were shot, are numerous
women and children.</p>

<p>“Units of the troops [<span class='it'>Wehrmannschaften</span>] also took part in
the action, by order of SS Lt. General [<span class='it'>Obergruppenfuehrer</span>]
von dem Bach. SA Colonel [<span class='it'>Standartenfuehrer</span>] Kunze led
the troops [Wehrmannschaften], who included also 90 members
of my authority and of the district-commissarate Minsk-Stadt.
Our men returned yesterday from the action without
any losses. I refuse the use of officials and Reich-Employees
of the General Commissarate in the rear areas. The men who
work for me have not been classified as essential, after all in
order to fight the partisans actively in the place of the Armed
Forces and the Police.</p>

<p>“Of the troops [<span class='it'>Wehrmannschaften</span>], one railroad employee
had been wounded (shot through the lung). The political
effect of this large scale action on the peaceful population had
<span class='pageno' title='383' id='Page_383'></span>
been disastrous, because of the numerous executions of
women and children. The town BEGOMIE was cleared by
the Armed Forces and the Police in December. The population
of Begomie was predominantly favorable to us. Begomie,
which has been fortified as a strong point by the partisans,
has been destroyed by German Air Attacks during the fighting.”
(<span class='it'>R-135</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>SS Obergruppenfuehrer</span> von dem Bach referred to in this
quotation is mentioned in Himmler’s speech to a gathering of SS
generals at Posen on 4 October 1943 (<span class='it'>1919-PS</span>). In this speech
Himmler announced the appointment of von dem Bach to be Chief
of all anti-partisan units:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“In the meantime I have also set up the department of Chief
of the Anti-partisan Units” [<span class='it'>Bandenkampf-Verbunde</span>]. Our
comrade <span class='it'>SS-Obergruppenfuehrer</span> von dem Bach is Chief of
the anti-partisan units. I considered it necessary for the
Reichsfuehrer SS to be in authoritative command in all these
battles, for I am convinced that we are best in a position to
take action against this enemy struggle, which is a decidedly
political one. Except where the units which had been supplied
and which we had formed for this purpose were taken
from us to fill in gaps at the front, we have been very successful.</p>

<p>“It is notable that, by setting up this department we have
gained (p. 58) for the SS in turn a division, a corps, an
army, and the next step, which is the High Command of an
army or even of a group—if you wish to call it that.”
<span class='it'>(1919-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The report of <span class='it'>Einsatzgruppe A</span>, (<span class='it'>L-180</span>) covering the period
up to 15 October 1941, makes clear beyond doubt the participation
of the German military leaders and Armed Forces in these
extermination policies:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Action-Group A, after preparing their vehicles for action
proceeded to their area of concentration as ordered on 23
June 1941, the second day of the campaign in the East. Army
Group North consisting of the 16th and 18th Armies and
Panzer-Group 4 had left the day before. Our task was to
hurriedly establish personal contact with the commanders of
the Armies and with the commander of the army of the rear
area. It must be stressed from the beginning that cooperation
with the Armed Forces was generally good, in some
cases, for instance with Panzer-Group 4 under Col. Gen.
Hoeppner, it was very close, almost cordial. Misunderstandings
<span class='pageno' title='384' id='Page_384'></span>
which cropped up with some authorities in the first days,
were cleared up mainly through personal discussions.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“Similarly, native anti-Semitic forces were induced to start
pogroms against Jews during the first hours after capture,
though this inducement proved to be very difficult. Following
out orders, the Security Police was determined to solve the
Jewish question with all possible means and most decisively.
But it was desirable that the Security Police should not put
in an immediate appearance, at least in the beginning, since
the extraordinarily harsh measures were apt to stir even German
circles. It had to be shown to the world that the native
population itself took the first action by way of natural reaction
against the suppression by Jews during several decades
and against the terror exercised by the Communists
during the preceding period.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“After the failure of purely military activities such as the
placing of sentries and combing through the newly occupied
territories with whole divisions, even the Armed Forces had
to look out for new methods. The Action-Group undertook to
search for new methods. Soon therefore the Armed Forces
adopted the experiences of the Security Police and their
methods of combatting the partisans. For details I refer to
the numerous reports concerning the struggle against the
partisans.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“1. <span class='it'>Instigation of self-cleansing actions.</span></p>

<p>“Considering that the population of the Baltic countries had
suffered very heavily under the government of Bolshevism
and Jewry while they were incorporated in the USSR, it was
to be expected that after the liberation from that foreign
government, they (i.e., the population themselves) would
render harmless most of the enemies left behind after the
retreat of the Red Army. It was the duty of the Security
Police to set in motion these self-cleansing movements and
to direct them into the correct channels in order to accomplish
the purpose of the cleansing operations as quickly as
possible. It was no less important in view of the future to
establish the unshakable and provable fact that the liberated
population themselves took the most severe measures against
the Bolshevist and Jewish enemy quite on their own, so that
the direction by German authorities could not be found out.</p>

<p>“In Lithouania this was achieved for the first time by partisan
<span class='pageno' title='385' id='Page_385'></span>
activities in Kowno. To our surprise it was not easy at
first to set in motion an extensive pogrom against Jews. KLIMATIS,
the leader of the partisan unit, mentioned above, who
was used for this purpose primarily, succeeded in starting a
pogrom on the basis of advice given to him by a small advanced
detachment acting in Kowno, and in such a way that
no German order or German instigation was noticed from
the outside. During the first pogrom in the night from 25. to
26.6 the Lithouanian partisans did away with more than 1,500
Jews, set fire to several Synagogues or destroyed them by
other means and burned down a Jewish dwelling district
consisting of about 60 houses. During the following nights
about 2,300 Jews were made harmless in a similar way. In
other parts of Lithouania similar actions followed the example
of Kowno, though smaller and extending to the Communists
who had been left behind.</p>

<p>“These self-cleansing actions went smoothly because the
Army authorities who had been informed showed understanding
for this procedure. From the beginning it was obvious
that only the first days after the occupation would
offer the opportunity for carrying out pogroms. After the
disarmament of the partisans the self-cleansing actions ceased
necessarily.</p>

<p>“It proved much more difficult to set in motion similar cleansing
actions in <span class='it'>Latvia</span>. Essentially the reason was that the
whole of the national stratum of leaders had been assassinated
or destroyed by the Soviets, especially in Riga. It was
possible though through similar influences on the Latvian
auxiliary to set in motion a pogrom against Jews also in Riga.
During this pogrom all synagogues were destroyed and about
400 Jews were killed. As the population of Riga quieted down
quickly, further pogroms were not convenient.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“5. <span class='it'>Other jobs of the Security Police.</span></p>

<p>“1. Occasionally the conditions prevailing in the lunatic
asylums necessitated operations of the Security Police. Many
institutions had been robbed by the retreating Russians of
their whole food supply. Often the guard and nursing personnel
had fled. The inmates of several institutions broke
out and became a danger to the general security; therefore</p>

<p class='pindent'>Certain affidavits, furnished by responsible officials in both the
<span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> and the SS, fill in much of the background for the
documents quoted above. An affidavit (<span class='it'>3710-PS</span>) by Walter
Schellenberg who, at the time under discussion, was an important
official in the RSHA, states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“In the middle of May 1941, as far as I remember, the Chief
of Amt 4 of the RSHA (SS-Brigadefuehrer Mueller), in
the name of the Chief of the RSHA (SS-Gruppenfuehrer
Heydrich), held discussions with the Generalquartiermeister
of the Army (General Wagner) about questions connected
with the operations of the SIPO and SD within the bounds
of the Field Army during the imminent campaign against
Russia. Wagner could come to no agreement with Mueller
and therefore asked Heydrich to send another representative.
I was at that time Chief of Section E in Amt 4 of the
RSHA under Chief of Amt Mueller and was sent by Heydrich
to Wagner because of my experience in matters of protocol
for the purpose of drawing up the final agreement. According
to the instructions given to me, I was supposed to make
sure that this agreement would provide that the responsible
headquarters in the Army would be firmly obligated to give
complete support to all activities of the Combat Groups and
Combat Commandos of the SIPO and SD. I discussed the
problem of this mutual relationship in great detail with Wagner.
In accordance with this discussion I then presented him
<span class='pageno' title='387' id='Page_387'></span>
with the completed draft of an agreement, which met with his
full approval. This draft of an agreement was the basis for
a final discussion between Wagner and Heydrich towards the
end of May 1941.</p>

<p>“The contents of this agreement, as far as I remember, were
substantially as follows. Its basis was the Fuehrer’s command,
mentioned at the very beginning of the agreement,
that the SIPO and SD should operate within the combat elements
of the Field Army, with the mission of utterly smashing
all resistance in conquered front-line areas as well as in
conquered rear supply zones by every means and as quickly
as possible. The various areas were then set down in which
the SIPO and SD were to be active and operating. The individual
Combat Groups were then assigned to the army
groups which were to take part in the campaign and the
individual Combat Commandos to the respective armies which
were to take part in the campaign.</p>

<p>“The Combat Groups and Combat Commandos were to operate
in detail:</p>

<p>“1. In front-line areas: in complete subordination to the Field
Army, tactically, functionally and administratively;</p>

<p>“2. In rear operational areas: in merely administrative subordination
to the Field Army, but under command and functional
control of the RSHA;</p>

<p>“3. In rear Army areas: arrangement as in 2;</p>

<p>“4. In areas of the civil administration in the East: same as
in the Reich.</p>

<p>“The tactical and functional authority and responsibility of
front-line headquarters of the Field Army over the Combat
Commandos found no limitation in the agreement and therefore
needed no further clarification.</p>

<p>“The agreement made it clear that the administrative subordination
embraced not only disciplinary subordination but also
the obligation for rear headquarters of the Field Army to
support the Combat Groups and Combat Commandos in matters
of supply (gasoline, rations, etc.) as well as in the use
of the communications network.</p>

<p>“This agreement was signed by Heydrich and Wagner in my
presence. Wagner signed it either ‘acting for’ or ‘by order of’
the OKH.</p>

<p>“After Wagner and Heydrich had affixed their signatures,
both of them asked me to leave the room for half an hour.
Just while leaving I heard how they both wanted to discuss
in complete privacy the Fuehrer’s command, which was apparently
<span class='pageno' title='388' id='Page_388'></span>
known in advance by each of them personally, and
its far-reaching implications. After the half hour was over
I was called in once more just to say goodbye.</p>

<p>“Today I read the ‘Operational and Situational Report No.
6 of the Combat Groups of the SIPO and SD in the USSR
(covering the period from 1 to 31 October 1941),’ as well as
the ‘Comprehensive Report of Combat Group A up to 15
October 1941.’ The whole substance of these reports shows
that the prime mission of the Combat Groups and Combat
Commandos of the SIPO and SD was to undertake and carry
out mass executions of Jews, Communists and other elements
of resistance. It is also clear from the above-cited ‘Comprehensive
Report,’ which embraces no more than the first four
months of these operations, that the cooperation of the respective
<span class='it'>Oberbefehlshabers</span> with Combat Group A was ‘in
general good and in individual instances, for instance that of
Panzergruppe 4 under Colonel General Hoeppner, very close,
in fact almost cordial’ (page 1). From an inclosure to this
same report, bearing the title ‘Summary of the Number of
Executed Persons,’ particularly from the figures arranged
according to the successively conquered areas, it is evident
that the SIPO and SD operated in front-line areas so as fully
to carry out their prime function of conducting mass executions
of all elements of resistance even from the very beginning
of the advance against Russia. I acknowledge the
reliability and authenticity of both of the above cited reports.
Therefore I must today express my firm conviction that the
Oberbefehlshabers of the army groups and armies which were
to take part in the Russian campaign were accurately informed
through the normal OKH channels of communication
about the extensive future mission of the Combat Groups
and Combat Commandos of the SIPO and SD as including
planned mass executions of Jews, Communists and all other
elements of resistance.</p>

<p>“In the beginning of June 1941 all of the Ic counter-intelligence
officers, and, as far as I remember, all of the Ic officers
of all army groups, armies, army corps and some of the
divisions which were to take part in the coming Russian
campaign were called in by Wagner, together with Heydrich
and the Chief of the Amt for Counter-Intelligence Abroad in
the OKW (Admiral Canaris) for a general conference in the
OKW Building at Berlin. The responsible leaders of the
Combat Groups and Combat Commandos of the SIPO and
SD were for the most part likewise present. I was also there.
<span class='pageno' title='389' id='Page_389'></span>
The essential substance and purpose of this meeting was to
outline the military strategy against Russia and to announce
the above-mentioned details of the written agreement reached
by Wagner and Heydrich.</p>

<p>“This group of Ic counter-intelligence officers and Ic officers
remained at Berlin a few days longer and was carefully instructed
in several additional conferences, at which I was
not present, about further details of the coming Russian campaign.
I assume that these discussions were concerned with
the exact delineation of the Fuehrer’s command ‘to smash utterly
all resistance in occupied areas by every means and as
quickly as possible,’ including even planned mass executions
of all elements of resistance. Otherwise the cooperation between
the Field Army and the Combat Groups, which in the
above-cited documents is clearly revealed as existing but a
few weeks thereafter, could not in my opinion have been
forthcoming. In any event there is hardly any reason to
doubt that these Ic counter-intelligence officers, immediately
upon their return from Berlin, accurately informed their own
superiors, including all Oberbefehlshabers of the army groups
and armies which were to march against Russia, about the
full extent of the agreement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another affidavit which sheds light on the relations between
the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> and the SS at the top level with respect to anti-partisan
warfare (<span class='it'>3711-PS</span>) is sworn to by Wilhelm Scheidt, a
retired captain of the German Army who worked in the War History
Section of OKW from 1941 to 1945:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I, Wilhelm Scheidt, belonged to the War History Section
of the OKW from the year 1941 to 1945.</p>

<p>“Concerning the question of partisan warfare I state that I
remember the following from my knowledge of the documents
of the Operations Staff of the OKW as well as from my conversations
in the Fuehrer’s headquarters with Generalmajor
Walter Scherff, the Fuehrer’s appointee for the compilation
of the history of the war.</p>

<p>“Counter-partisan warfare was originally a responsibility of
Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler, who sent police forces
to handle this matter.</p>

<p>“In the years 1942 and 1943 however counter-partisan warfare
developed to such an extent that the Operations Staff of
the OKW had to give it particular attention. In the Army
Operations Section of the Operations Staff of the OKW a
<span class='pageno' title='390' id='Page_390'></span>
specific officer was assigned the development of counter-partisan
warfare as his special job. It proved necessary to conduct
extensive operations against the partisans with <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>
troops in Russian as well as Yugoslavian territory. Partisan
operations for a long while threatened to cut off the lines
of communication and transport routes that were necessary
to support the German <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>. For instance, a monthly
report concerning the attacks on the railroad lines in occupied
Russia revealed that in the Russian area alone from 800
to 1,000 attacks occurred each month during that period, causing
among other things, the loss of from 200 to 300 locomotives.</p>

<p>“It was a well-known fact that partisan warfare was conducted
with cruelty on both sides. It was also well-known
that reprisals were inflicted on hostages and communities
whose inhabitants were suspected of being partisans or of
supporting them. It is beyond question that these facts must
have been known to the leading officers in the Operations
Staff of the OKW and in the Army’s General Staff. It was
further well-known that Hitler believed that the only successful
method of conducting counter-partisan warfare was
to employ cruel punishments as deterrents.</p>

<p>“I remember that at the time of the Polish revolt in Warsaw,
SS-Gruppenfuehrer Fegelein reported to Generaloberst
Guderian and Jodl about the atrocities of the Russian SS-Brigade
Kaminski, which fought on the German side.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>“(Signed) Wilhelm Scheidt</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“Retired Captain of the Reserve”&nbsp;&nbsp;(<span class='it'>3711-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The foregoing documents show the arrangements which were
made between the OKW, OKH and Himmler’s headquarters with
respect to anti-partisan warfare. They show conclusively that
the plans and arrangements were made jointly, and that the
High Command of the Armed Forces was not only fully aware
of but an active participant in these plans. The same is true of
the field commanders. General Roettiger, who attained the rank
of General of Panzer Troops (the equivalent of a Lt. General in
the American Army), has made three statements (<span class='it'>3713-PS</span>;
<span class='it'>3714-PS</span>). Roettiger was Chief of Staff of the German 4th Army,
and later of Army Group Center, on the Eastern Front during
the period of which he speaks:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“As Chief of Staff of the 4th Army from May 1942 to June
1943, to which was later added the area of the 9th Army, I
often had occasion to concern myself officially with anti-partisan
warfare. During these operations the troops received
<span class='pageno' title='391' id='Page_391'></span>
orders from the highest authority, as for example even the
OKH, to use the harshest methods. These operations were
carried out by troops of the Army Group and of the Army, as
for example security battalions.</p>

<p>“At the beginning, in accordance with orders which were
issued through official channels, only a few prisoners were
taken. In accordance with orders, Jews, political commissars
and agents were delivered up to the SD.</p>

<p>“The number of enemy dead mentioned in official reports
was very high in comparison with our own losses. From the
documents which have been shown to me I have now come
to realize that the order from highest authorities for the
harshest conduct of the anti-partisan war can have been intended
to make possible a ruthless liquidation of Jews and
other undesirable elements by using for this purpose the military
struggle of the army against the partisans.” (<span class='it'>3713-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Roettiger’s second statement reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Supplementary to my above declaration I declare:</p>

<p>“As I stated orally on 28 November, my then Commander-in-Chief
of the Fourth Army instructed his troops many
times not to wage war against the partisans more severely
than was required at the time by the position. This struggle
should only be pushed to the annihilation of the enemy after
all attempts to bring about a surrender failed. Apart from
humanitarian reasons we necessarily had an interest in taking
prisoners since very many of them could very well be
used as members of native volunteer units against the partisans.</p>

<p>“Alongside the necessary active combatting of partisans
there was propaganda directed at the partisans and also at
the population with the object, by peaceful means, of causing
them to give up partisan activities. For instance, in this way
the women too were continually urged to get their men back
from the forests or to keep them by other means from joining
the partisans. And this propaganda had good results.
In the spring of 1943 the area of the 4th Army was as good
as cleared of partisans. Only on its boundaries and then from
time to time were partisans in evidence at times when they
crossed into the area of the 4th Army from neighboring
areas. The army was obliged on this account on the orders
of the Army Group to give up security forces to the neighboring
army to the south.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pageno' title='392' id='Page_392'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Roettiger’s third statement reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“During my period of service in 1942/3 as chief of staff of
the 4th Army of the Central Army Group, SD units were attached
in the beginning, apparently for the purpose of counter-intelligence
activity in front-line areas. It was clear that
these SD units were causing great disturbances among the
local civilian population with the result that my commanding
officer therefore asked the commander-in-chief of the army
group, Field Marshal von Kluge, to order the SD units to
clear out of the front-line areas, which took place immediately.
The reason for this first and foremost was that the
excesses of the SD units by way of execution of Jews and
other persons assumed such proportions as to threaten the
security of the Army in its combat areas because of the
aroused civilian populace. Although in general the special
tasks of the SD units were well known and appeared to be
carried out with the knowledge of the highest military authorities,
we opposed these methods as far as possible, because
of the danger which existed for our troops.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“(Signed) Roettiger”&nbsp;&nbsp;(<span class='it'>3714-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>An extract from the War Diary of the Deputy Chief of the
Armed Forces Operational Staff (Warlimont), dated 14 March
1943, deals with the problem of shipping off suspected partisans
to concentration camps in Germany (<span class='it'>1786-PS</span>). It appears clearly
from this extract that the Army was chiefly concerned with preserving
a sufficient severity of treatment for suspected partisans,
without at the same time obstructing the procurement of labor
from the occupied territories:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The General Quartermaster [<span class='it'>General Quartiermeister</span>] together
with the Economic Staff (East) [<span class='it'>Wirtschaftsstab Ost</span>]
has proposed that the deportees should be sent either to
prison camps or to ‘training centres in their own area,’ and
that deportation to Germany should take place only when the
deportees are on probation and in less serious cases.</p>

<p>“In view of the Armed Forces Operations Staff [<span class='it'>Wehrmachtfuehrungstab</span>]
this proposal does not take sufficient account
of the severity required and leads to a comparison with the
treatment meted out to the ‘peaceful population’ which has
been called upon to work. He recommends therefore transportation
to concentration camps in Germany which have already
been introduced by the Reichsfuehrer SS for his sphere
and which he is prepared to introduce for the Armed Forces
[<span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>] in the case of an extension to the province of
the latter. The High Command of the Armed Forces [<span class='it'>Oberkommando
<span class='pageno' title='393' id='Page_393'></span>
der Wehrmacht</span>] therefore orders that partisan
helpers and suspects who are not to be executed should be
handed over to the competent Higher SS and Police Leader
[<span class='it'>Hoehrer SS und Polizeifuehrer</span>] and orders that the difference
between ‘punitive work’ and ‘work in Germany’ is to be
made clear to the population.” (<span class='it'>1786-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A final group of four affidavits show that the SD <span class='it'>Einsatzgruppen</span>
on the Eastern Front operated under the command and with
the necessary support of the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>, and that the nature of
their activities were fully known to the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>. The first of
these is a statement (<span class='it'>3715-PS</span>) by Ernst Rode, who was an SS
Brigadefuehrer and Generalmajor of the Police, and was head of
Himmler’s personal command staff from 1943 to 1945:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>STATEMENT</p>

<p>“I, Ernst Rode, was formerly chief of the Command Staff
of the Reichsfuehrer-SS, having taken over this position in
the spring of 1943 as successor to former SS-Obergruppenfuehrer
Kurt Knoblauch. My last rank was Generalmajor
of Police and of the Waffen-SS. My function was to furnish
forces necessary for anti-partisan warfare to the higher SS
and police leaders and to guarantee the support of army
forces. This took place through personal discussions with the
leading officers of the Operations Staff of the OKW and
OKH, namely with General Warlimont, General von Buttlar,
Generaloberst Guderian, Generaloberst Zeitzler, General Heusinger,
later General Wenk, Colonel Graf Kielmannsegg and
Colonel v. Bonin. Since anti-partisan warfare also was under
the sole command of the respective Army commander-in-chief
in operational areas (for instance in the Central Army Group
under Field Marshal Kluge and later Busch) and since police
troops for the most part could not be spared from the
Reichscommissariates, the direction of this warfare lay practically
always entirely in the hands of the army. In the
same way orders were issued not by Himmler but by the
OKH. SS and police troops transferred to operational areas
from the Reichscommissariates to support the army groups
were likewise under the latter’s command. Such transfers
often resulted in harm to anti-partisan warfare in the Reichscommissariates.
According to a specific agreement between
Himmler and the OKH, the direction of individual operations
lay in the hands of the troop leader who commanded the
largest troop contingent. It was therefore possible that an
army general could have SS and police under him, and on
the other hand that army troops could be placed under a
<span class='pageno' title='394' id='Page_394'></span>
general of the SS and police. Anti-partisan warfare in operational
areas could never be ordered by Himmler. I could
merely request the OKH to order it, until 1944 mostly through
the intervention of Generalquartiermeister Wagner or
through State Secretary Ganzenmueller. The OKH then issued
corresponding orders to the army groups concerned, for
compliance.</p>

<p>“The severity and cruelty with which the intrinsically diabolical
partisan warfare was conducted by the Russians had
already resulted in Draconian laws being issued by Hitler
for its conduct. These orders, which were passed on to the
troops through the OKW and OKH, were equally applicable
to army troops as well as to those of the SS and police. There
was absolutely no difference in the manner in which these
two components carried on this warfare. Army soldiers were
exactly as embittered against the enemy as those of the SS
and police. As a result of this embitterment orders were
ruthlessly carried out by both components, a thing which was
also quite in keeping with Himmler’s desires or intentions.
As proof of this the order of the OKW and OKH can be adduced,
which directed that all captured partisans, for instance
such as Jews, agents and political commissars, should without
delay be handed over by the troops to the SD for special
treatment. This order also contained the provision that in
anti-partisan warfare no prisoners except the above named
be taken. That anti-partisan warfare was carried on by army
troops mercilessly and to every extreme I know as the result
of discussions with army troop leaders, for instance with
General Herzog, Commander of the XXXVIII Army Corps
and with his chief of staff, Colonel Pamberg in the General
Staff, both of whom support my opinion. Today it is clear to
me that anti-partisan warfare gradually became an excuse
for the systematic annihilation of Jewry and Slavism.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“(Signed) Ernst Rode”&nbsp;&nbsp;(<span class='it'>3715-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Another and shorter statement by Rode reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“As far as I know, the SD Combat Groups with the individual
army groups were <span class='it'>completely subordinate</span> to them, that
is to say tactically as well as in every other way. The commanders-in-chief
were therefore thoroughly cognizant of the
missions and operational methods of these units. They approved
of these missions and operational methods because
apparently they never opposed them. The fact that prisoners,
such as Jews, agents and commissars, who were handed over
to the SD underwent the same cruel death, as victims of so-called
<span class='pageno' title='395' id='Page_395'></span>
‘purifications,’ is a proof that the executions had their
approval. This also corresponded with what the highest political
and military authorities wanted. Frequent mention
of these methods were naturally made in my presence at the
OKW and OKH, and they were condemned by most SS and
police officers, just as they were condemned by most army
officers. On such occasions I always pointed out that it would
have been quite within the scope of the authority of the commanders-in-chief
of army groups to oppose such methods. I
am of the firm conviction that an energetic and unified protest
by all field marshals would have resulted in a change of
these missions and methods. If they should ever assert that
they would then have been succeeded by even more ruthless
commanders-in-chief, this, in my opinion, would be a foolish
and even cowardly dodge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In an affidavit by Colonel Bogislav von Bonin, who at the beginning
of the Russian campaign was a staff officer with the
17th Panzer Division, the following statement is made:</p>

<p>“At the beginning of the Russian campaign I was the first
General Staff officer of the 17th Panzer Division which had
the mission of driving across the Bug north of Brest-Litovsk.
Shortly before the beginning of the attack my division received
through channels from the OKW a written order of
the Fuehrer. This order directed that Russian commissars
be shot upon capture, without judicial process, immediately
and ruthlessly. This order extended to all units of the Eastern
Army. Although the order was supposed to be relayed to
companies, the Commanding General of the XXXVII Panzer
Corps (General of Panzer Troops Lemelsen) forbade its
being passed on to the troops because it appeared unacceptable
to him from military and moral points of view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally an affidavit (<span class='it'>3717-PS</span>) by Heusinger, who was a Generalleutnant

<p>“This made the chief of the General Staff of the Army responsible
for all matters in the operational areas in the east,
while the OKW was responsible for all matters outside the
operational areas, for instance, all troops (security units, SS
units, police) stationed in the Reichscommissariates.</p>

<p>“All police and SS units in the Reichscommissariates were
also subordinate to the Reichsfuehrer-SS. When it was necessary
to transfer such units into operational areas, this had to
be done by order of the chief of the OKW. On the other hand,
corresponding transfers from the front to the rear were
ordered by the OKW with the concurrence of the chief of the
General Staff of the Army.</p>

<p>“The high SS and police leaders normally had command of
operations against partisans. If stronger army units were
committed together with the SS and police units within operational
areas, a high commander of the army could be
designated commander of the operation.</p>

<p>“During anti-partisan operations <span class='it'>within</span> operational areas all
forces committed for these operations were under the command
of the respective commander-in-chief of the army
group.</p>

<p>“2. Directives as to the manner and methods of carrying on
counter-partisan operations were issued by the OKW (Keitel)
to the OKH upon orders from Hitler and after consultation
with Himmler. The OKH was responsible merely for the
transmission of these orders to army groups, for instance
such orders as those concerning the treatment to be accorded
to commissars and communists, those concerning the manner
of prosecuting by courts martial army personnel who had
committed offenses against the population, as well as those
establishing the basic principles governing reprisals against
the inhabitants.</p>

<p>“3. The detailed working out of all matters involving the
treatment of the local populace as well as anti-partisan warfare
in operational areas, in pursuance of orders from the
OKW, was the responsibility of the Generalquartiermeister of
the OKH.</p>

<p>“4. It had always been my personal opinion that the treatment
of the civilian population and the methods of anti-partisan
warfare in operational areas presented the highest political
and military leaders with a welcomed opportunity of
carrying out their plans, namely the systematic extermination
of Slavism and Jewry. Entirely independent of this, I
always regarded these cruel methods as military insanity, because
<span class='pageno' title='397' id='Page_397'></span>
they only helped to make combat against the enemy unnecessarily
more difficult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) <span class='it'>Responsibility of the Group for War Crimes and Crimes
Against Humanity: Counts 3 and 4 of the Indictment.</span> The foregoing
evidence against the General Staff and High Command
Group is such that no German soldier can view it with anything
but shame. The German High Command developed and applied
a policy of terror against commandos and paratroopers, in violation
of the Hague and Geneva Conventions, on the Western Front.
On the Eastern Front it descended to savagery. In advance of the
attack against the Soviet Union, the High Command ordered the
troops to take “ruthless action”, left it to the discretion of any
officer to decide whether suspected civilians should be immediately
shot, and empowered any officer with the powers of a Battalion
Commander to take “collective despotic measures” against localities.
Offenses committed against civilians by German soldiers,
however, were not required to be prosecuted, and prosecution
was suggested only where desirable in order to maintain discipline
and security from a military standpoint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after the invasion of the Soviet Union, German troops
were told by the OKW that “a human life in unsettled countries
frequently counts for nothing” and were encouraged to observe
a punitive ratio of 50 to 100 Communists for one German soldier.
German troops were told that they were to take “revenge on sub-human
Jewry” and that they were not merely soldiers but “bearers
of ruthless national ideology and avengers of bestialities”.
The High Command and the chief lieutenants of Himmler jointly
planned the establishment of the <span class='it'>Einsatzgruppen</span>, the behavior
of which has been shown in detail. These groups when in operational
areas were under the command of the German Army, and
German soldiers joined in their savagery. The <span class='it'>Einsatzgruppen</span>
were completely dependent upon the Armed Forces for supplies
with which to carry out their atrocities. The practices employed
against the civilian population and against partisans were well
known to all high ranking German officers on the Eastern Front.
No doubt some of them disapproved of what was going on. Nonetheless,
the full support of the military leaders continued to be
given to these activities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The record is clear that the General Staff and High Command
<span class='pageno' title='398' id='Page_398'></span>
Group, including the defendants, who were members of the Group
and numerous other members ordered, directed, and participated
in war crimes and crimes against humanity as specified in counts
3 and 4 of the Indictment.</p>

<h3>C. <span class='it'>Conclusion.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>The world must bear in mind that the German High Command
is not an evanescent thing, the creature of a decade of unrest, or
a school of thought or tradition which is shattered or utterly discredited.
The German High Command and military tradition
have in the past achieved victory and survived defeat. They have
met with triumph and disaster, and have survived through a singular
durability not unmixed with stupidity. An eminent American
statesman and diplomat, Mr. Sumner Welles, has written
(“The Time for Decision”, 1944, pp. 261-262) that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * the authority to which the German people have
so often and so disastrously responded was not in reality the
German Emperor of yesterday, or the Hitler of to-day, but
the German General Staff.</p>

<p>“It will be said that this insistence that the German General
Staff has been the driving force in German policy is a dangerous
oversimplification. I am not disposed to minimize the
importance of other factors in German history. They all have
their place. But I am convinced that each of them has played
its part only in so far as it was permitted to do so by the real
master of the German race, namely, German militarism, personified
in, and channelled through, the German General
Staff.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“Whether their ostensible ruler is the Kaiser, or Hindenburg,
or Adolf Hitler, the continuing loyalty of the bulk of the population
is given to that military force controlled and guided by
the German General Staff. To the German people, the army
to-day, as in the past, is the instrument by which German
domination will be brought about. Generations of Germans
may pass. The nation may undergo defeat after defeat. But
if the rest of the world permits it, the German General Staff
will continue making its plans for the future.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The German General Staff and High Command is indicted not
now at the bar of history, but on specific charges of crimes against
International Law and the dictates of the conscience of mankind
as embodied in the Charter. The picture that emerges from the
evidence is that of a group of men with great powers for good
<span class='pageno' title='399' id='Page_399'></span>
or ill who chose the latter; who deliberately set out to arm Germany
to the point where the German will could be imposed on the
rest of the world; and who gladly joined with the most evil forces
at work in Germany. “Hitler produced the results which all of
us warmly desired”, Blomberg and Blaskowitz say, and that is
obviously the truth. The converse is no less clear; the military
leaders furnished Hitler with the means and might which were
necessary to his mere survival, to say nothing of the accomplishment
of those purposes which seem to the world so ludicrously
impossible in 1932 and so fearfully imminent in 1942.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was said above that the German militarists were inept as
well as persistent. Helpless as Hitler would have been without
them, he succeeded in mastering them. The generals and the Nazis
were allies in 1933. But it was not enough for the Nazis that the
generals should be voluntary allies; Hitler wanted them permanently
and completely under his control. Devoid of political skill
or principle, the generals lacked the mentality or morality to resist.
On the day of the death of President Hindenburg in August
1934, the German officers swore a new oath. Their previous oath
had been to the Fatherland; now it was to a man, Adolf Hitler.
It was not until 18 days later that the law requiring this change
was passed. A year later the Nazi emblem became part of their
uniform and the Nazi flag their standard. By a clever process of
infiltration into key positions, Hitler seized control of the entire
military machine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No doubt these generals will ask what they could have done
about it. It will be said that they were helpless, and that to protect
their jobs and families and their own lives they had to follow
Hitler’s decisions. No doubt this became true. But the generals
were a key factor in Hitler’s rise to complete power and a partner
in his criminal aggressive designs. It is always difficult and
dangerous to withdraw from a criminal conspiracy. Never has
it been suggested that a conspirator may claim mercy on the
ground that his fellow-conspirators threatened him with harm
should he withdraw from the plot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In many respects the spectacle which the German General Staff
and High Command group presents today is the most degrading
of all the groups and organizations charged in the Indictment.
The bearers of a tradition not devoid of valour and honour, they
emerge from this war stained both by criminality and ineptitude.
Attracted by the militaristic and aggressive Nazi policies, the German
generals found themselves drawn into adventures of a scope
they had not foreseen. From crimes in which almost all of them
participated willingly and approvingly were born others in which
<span class='pageno' title='400' id='Page_400'></span>
they participated because they were too ineffective to alter the
governing Nazi policies, and because they had to continue collaboration
to save their own skins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having joined the partnership, the General Staff and High
Command group planned and carried through manifold acts of
aggression which turned Europe into a charnel-house, and caused
the Armed Forces to be used for foul practices foully executed of
terror, pillage, murder and wholesale slaughter. Let no one be
heard to say that the military uniform shall be their cloak, or that
they may find sanctuary by pleading membership in the profession
to which they are an eternal disgrace.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='416' id='Page_416'></span><h1>Chapter XVI<br/> INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY OF DEFENDANTS</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The crime of conspiracy is recognized, in various forms, in
nearly every legal system. The Anglo-American doctrine of conspiracy,
despite technical differences, is analogous in purpose to
the Soviet notion of a “criminal gang” and the French <span class='it'>association
de malfaiteurs</span>. German law, both before and after the Nazi
seizure of power, also contained a similar concept. The fundamentals
of the doctrine, common to most systems of law, are reflected
in Article 6 of the Charter, which declares it a crime to
participate in “the formulation or execution of a common plan or
conspiracy” to plan or wage aggressive war, to commit War
Crimes, or to commit Crimes against Humanity. Count I of the
Indictment charges the existence of such a conspiracy on the part
of the defendants, acting together with divers other persons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The essence of conspiracy is the joining together of persons to
pursue unlawful ends, by legal or illegal means, or to pursue lawful
ends by illegal means. A conspiracy may exist even though
the ends or means employed by the conspirators might have been
perfectly legal if carried out by one person acting alone. The
gravamen of the crime is association and acting in concert for the
purpose of formulating and executing a common plan involving
criminal ends or means.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Participation in a common plan or conspiracy results in vicarious
liability, in the sense that each member of the conspiracy is
liable for the acts of every other conspirator, even though he may
have actually committed no criminal acts himself. He still may
be adjudged criminal for mere participation in a common plan to
pursue a common criminal purpose, regardless of disparities in the
functions performed by individual conspirators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, in order to prove the participation of a certain
person in a conspiracy, his own acts must be considered. The
roles played by the various members of the Nazi conspiracy are
necessarily different. The following sections sketch in rough outline
the parts played by each of the 22 defendants (excepting
Sauckel and Speer who are discussed in Chapter X) and the former
defendant and co-conspirator, Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach,
in the conspiracy to commit Crimes against Peace, War
Crimes against Humanity, as alleged in Count I of the Indictment.
These sections are by no means exhaustive but merely indicate
the general lines of a particular defendant’s participation. Further
and more detailed discussion of the parts played by the conspirators
<span class='pageno' title='417' id='Page_417'></span>
in particular phases of the conspiracy will be found under
the pertinent subject matter in the preceding chapters.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg417a'>1. HERMANN WILHELM GOERING</h2>

<p class='pindent'>For more than two decades Hermann Goering played one of
the foremost roles amongst the Nazi conspirators. He, who
called himself the most faithful paladin of the Fuehrer, was a key
figure within the conspiracy, participating in nearly all phases
of the conspiratorial activities. He took part in the Munich Beer
Hall putsch of 1923; he promoted Hitler’s rise to power in 1933;
he founded the Gestapo in 1933 and the concentration camps in
1934; and he created the German Luftwaffe, making it an instrument
for aggressive war and using it to destroy other countries.
As Plenipotentiary for the Four-Year Plan and chairman of the
Ministerial Council for Defense, Goering became the Czar of German
economy and administration and eventually the executive
manager of the entire conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following list, the correctness of which has been certified
by Goering and his attorney (<span class='it'>2836-PS</span>) is a partial statement of
positions and offices held by him from 1922 to 1945:</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Goering was a member of and assisted in the Nazi conspiracy
to commit crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against
humanity, in the following ways:</p>

<h3>A. <span class='it'>CRIMES AGAINST PEACE.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Acquisition and Consolidation of Power in Germany.</span>
<span class='pageno' title='418' id='Page_418'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) <span class='it'>Before 1933.</span> Soon after joining the Party, Goering in
1923 was placed in command of the entire SA (<span class='it'>2168-PS</span>). In November
1923, he took part in the ill-fated attempt at Munich to
gain control of the German State by force. In the encounter with
the police, Goering was wounded and fled from Germany.
(<span class='it'>2532-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>After his return, Goering became more than a commander of
street fighters. He was designated Hitler’s first political assistant.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The movement was conducted by the Fuehrer from Munich.
But one man has to act for him in Berlin, while Gauleiter
Goebbels stirs up the masses and makes them ripe for National
Socialism, a man on whom he could rely unconditionally
to the same extent as if he acted himself. And thus, Hermann
Goering became the political deputy of Adolf Hitler.”
(<span class='it'>3252-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Goering’s official biographer, the Ministerial Dirgent Gritzbach,
tells of his dealings with the Bruening government, his attempts
to “break down the barrier” around the Reich President, von Hindenburg,
and of his “coup” as Reichstag President in September
1932 in procuring a vote of nonconfidence against the Papen government
just before the Reichstag could be dissolved (<span class='it'>3252-PS</span>).
Goering says in his own book, <span class='it'>Aufbau einer Nation</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The moment was unforgettable for me who have gone back
and forth as representative so often between the Kaiserhof
and the Wilhelmstrasse during the past year, when I hurried
out to my car and could report to the questioning masses as
the first one: ‘Hitler has become Reich Chancellor.’ ”
(<span class='it'>3251-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Goebbels also gave him full measure of credit:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“ ‘This is surely Goering’s happiest hour’ wrote Dr. Goebbels
in his book Von Kaiserhof zur Reichskanzlei, and, quoting
from it, said: that ‘Goering prepared diplomatically and politically
in a long lasting all hard struggle the basis for Hitler’s
rise.” (<span class='it'>3252-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In a letter written in 1935, Hitler summarized Goering’s contributions
as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“My dear Goering: When in November 1923 the Party tried
for the first time to conquer the power of the State, you as
Commander of the SA created within an extraordinarily
short time that instrument with which I could bear that struggle.
Highest necessity had forced us to act, but a wise providence
at that time denied that success. After receiving a
grave wound you again entered the ranks as soon as circumstances
permitted as my most loyal comrade in the battle for
<span class='pageno' title='419' id='Page_419'></span>
power. You contributed essentially to creating the basis for
the 30th of January. Therefore, at the end of a year of the
National Socialist Revolution, I desire to thank you whole-heartedly,
my dear Party Comrade Goering, for the great
values which you have for the National Socialist Revolution
and consequently, for the German people. In cordial friendship
and grateful appreciation.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>Yours,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>Adolf Hitler.”</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>(<span class='it'>3259-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Goering himself has boasted:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Numerous titles and honors have been bestowed on me during
the past months, and still no title and no decoration could
make me so proud, as the designation, given to me by the
German people: ‘The most faithful paladin of our Fuehrer.’
In that, my relationship to the Fuehrer finds expression. I
followed him for over a decade with unreserved faith, and
I will follow him with the same unconditional faith until my
end.” (<span class='it'>3251-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) <span class='it'>Prussia, 1933-36.</span> Immediately after the 30th of January
1933, Goering was awarded the key post of acting Prussian Minister
of the Interior, and shortly thereafter, that of Minister President
of Prussia. In these capacities, he proceeded promptly to
establish a regime of terror in Prussia designed to suppress all
opposition to the Nazi program.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His chief tool was the Prussian police, which remained under
his jurisdiction until 1936. As early as February 1933, he ordered
the entire police forces to render unqualified assistance to the
para-military organizations supporting the new government, such
as the SA and the SS, and to crush all political opponents with
firearms, if necessary, regardless of the consequences. (Directive
of 10 February 1933, Ministerialblatt fuer die Preussische innere
Verwaltung 1933, p. 148; Directive of 17 February 1933, <span class='it'>id</span>, p.
169). Goering has frequently and proudly acknowledged his own
personal responsibility for the crimes committed pursuant to orders
of this character:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I declared at that time before thousands of fellow Germans,
each bullet which leaves the barrel of a police pistol now is
my bullet. If one calls this murder, then I have murdered;
I ordered all this, I back it up. I assume the responsibility,
and I am not afraid to do so.” (<span class='it'>2324-PS; 3252-PS.</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after he became Prussian Minister President, Goering
began to develop the Gestapo, or Secret State Police. To quote
from his own book:
<span class='pageno' title='420' id='Page_420'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The most important thing for me was first, to get the instrument
of power of the protective police and political police
firmly in my hand. Here I undertook the first sweeping
changes of personnel. Of the 32 available colonels of the
protective police, I dismissed 22. Hundreds of officers and
thousands of sergeants followed them in the course of the
next months. New forces were procured, and everywhere,
these forces were taken out of the large reserve pool of the
SA and the SS.</p>

<p>“For weeks, I personally worked on this transformation, and
finally I created alone and from my own conviction and own
thought the ‘Secret State Police Office’. That instrument,
feared so much by the enemies of the state, which above all
has contributed so much, that today a Communist or Marxist
danger in Germany or Prussia is hardly worth talking
about anymore.” (<span class='it'>3251-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In a public address delivered on 11 December 1934, Goering
boasted:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“We were firmly determined after assumption of power to
hit the Communists so that in Germany they would never recover
from our blow. For that we do not require a Reichstag
fire. That has been one of the most important points on
our program. In the former Weimar Constitution the destruction
of Communism was unthinkable. For the execution of
these measures we needed the instrument of a through and
through reliable, and of the highest degree powerful, police
force. I have created this instrument through the reorganization
of the field police (<span class='it'>Landespolizei</span>) and the formation
of a Secret State Police. These organizations will constitute
a means for implanting fear in all enemies of the State,
which a State needs if it wishes to defend itself for always”.

<p class='pindent'>On 26 April 1933 Goering signed the first law officially establishing
the Secret State Police in Prussia (<span class='it'>2104-PS</span>). On 30 November
1933, Goering signed a law naming himself, as Prime Minister,
Chief of the Prussian Secret State Police (<span class='it'>2105-PS</span>). He
continued in this position until sometime in 1936, when Himmler
secured control of all police in the Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Men and women taken into custody by the Gestapo were thrown,
without judicial or other form of trial, into concentration camps,
which had been established in Prussia as early as the spring of
1933. (<span class='it'>3252-PS</span>; <span class='it'>L-83</span>.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>As explained by Goering in his own book:
<span class='pageno' title='421' id='Page_421'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Against the enemies of the State, we must proceed ruthlessly.
It cannot be forgotten, that at the moment of our rise
to power, according to the official election figures of March
1933, six million people still confess their sympathy for Marxism.
* * * Therefore the concentration camps have been
created, where we have first confined thousands of Communists
and Social Democrat functionaries. * * *” (<span class='it'>2344-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 10 February 1936, Goering, as Prussian Minister President,
signed a further basic law on the Prussian Secret State Police.
Article 7 of this law provided:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Orders in matters of the Secret State Police are not subject
to the review of the administrative courts”. (<span class='it'>2107-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Thus it was made quite clear by Goering’s own law that those imprisoned
in concentration camps without trial of any kind were
to have no recourse to any court. On the same day Goering signed
a decree for the execution of the foregoing law, which further acknowledged
his responsibility for Prussian concentration camps.
Its provisions included the following:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Art. 2 * * * (4) The Secret State Police Bureau administers
the state concentration camps.” (<span class='it'>2108-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The range of police terrorism under Goering’s leadership was
almost limitless. A glance at a few of his police directives in these
early days will indicate the extent and thoroughness with which
every dissident voice was silenced:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p><span class='it'>Directive of 22 June 1933</span> (<span class='it'>Ministerial-Blatt fuer die Preussische
innere Verwaltung, 1933, p. 731</span>): Ordered all officials
to watch the statements of employees of the Prussian civil
service and to denounce to Goering those who made critical
remarks (“<span class='it'>Miesmacher</span>”); failure to do so regarded as proof
of hostile attitude.</p>

<p><span class='it'>Directive of 23 June 1933</span> (<span class='it'>Ministerial-Blatt fuer die Preussische
innere Verwaltung, 1933, p. 749</span>): Suppressed all activities
of the Social Democratic Party, including meetings
and press, and ordered confiscation of its property.</p>

<p><span class='it'>Directive of 30 June 1933</span> (<span class='it'>Ministerial-Blatt fuer die Preussische
innere Verwaltung, 1933, p. 793</span>): Ordered the Gestapo
authorities to report to the Labor Trustees on political attitudes
of workers, particularly in cases of criticism of the
regime.</p>

<p><span class='it'>Directive of 15 January 1934</span> (<span class='it'>Ministerial-Blatt fuer die
Preussische innere Verwaltung, 1933, p. 137</span>): Ordered the
Gestapo and frontier police to keep track of and to watch
emigres, particularly political emigres and Jews, residing in
<span class='pageno' title='422' id='Page_422'></span>
neighboring countries, and ordered them arrested and put
into concentration camps if they returned to Germany.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>After the elimination of the forces of the opposition, the Nazis
felt it necessary to dispose of nonconformists within their own
ranks. During the Roehm purge of 30 June 1934, many people were
murdered who had nothing to do with the internal SA revolt but
were just “not liked very well” (<span class='it'>2950-PS</span>). Goering’s role in this
bloody affair was related less than two weeks later by Hitler in a
speech to the Reichstag:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Meanwhile Minister President Goering had previously received
my instructions that in case of a purge, he was to
take analogous measures at once in Berlin and in Prussia.
With an iron fist he beat down the attack on the National
Socialist State before it could develop.” (<span class='it'>3442-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) <span class='it'>The Reich, 1933-39.</span> Meanwhile, in the central Reich government,
Goering occupied a series of the highest and most influential
positions. The broad powers which devolved upon him made
him, under Hitler, the Chief Executive of the Nazi State.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the accession to power, Goering retained the somewhat
empty title of Reichstag President but was also appointed Minister
Without Portfolio and became a cabinet member. When in
an early meeting (15 March 1933) the cabinet discussed the pending
Enabling Act (which gave the Cabinet plenary powers of
legislation) he offered the suggestion that the required two-thirds
majority might be obtained simply by refusing admittance to the
Social Democratic delegates (<span class='it'>2962-PS</span>). He became Reich Air
Minister in May 1933 (<span class='it'>2089-PS</span>). In his capacity as Air Minister
and Supreme Commander of the Luftwaffe, he sat as a member
of and the Fuehrer’s deputy on the Reich Defense Council,
which was established by the secret law of 21 May 1933 and continued
by the secret law of 4 September 1938 (<span class='it'>2261-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2194-PS</span>).
This Council was a war planning group whose purpose was “to
plan preparations and decrees in case of war which later on were
published by the Ministerial Council for the Defense of the Reich.”
(<span class='it'>2986-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1936, Goering was made Plenipotentiary for the Four-Year
Plan and acquired plenary legislative and administrative powers
over all German economic life. (<span class='it'>1862-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Goering was a member of the Secret Cabinet Council established
in 1938 to act as “an advisory board in the direction of
foreign policy” (<span class='it'>2031-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Ministerial Council for the Defense of the Reich, created in
1939, took over, in effect, all the legislative powers of the Cabinet
<span class='pageno' title='423' id='Page_423'></span>
which had not been reserved to Hitler’s personal control or to
Goering as the Delegate for the Four-Year Plan. Goering became
the Chairman of this Council. (<span class='it'>2018-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, as the invading Nazi armies marched into Poland, Hitler
announced the designation of Goering as successor designate,
the heir apparent of the “New Order.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>d</span>) <span class='it'>Economic Preparation for War, 1933-1939.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In April 1936, Goering was appointed Coordinator for Raw
Materials and Foreign Exchange and empowered to supervise
all State and Party activities in these fields (<span class='it'>2827-PS</span>). In this
capacity he convened the War Minister, the Minister of Economics,
the Reich Finance Minister, the President of the Reichsbank,
and the Prussian Finance Minister to discuss inter-agency
problems connected with war mobilization. At a meeting of this
group on 12 May 1936, when the question of the prohibitive cost
of synthetic raw material substitutes arose, Goering said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“If we have war tomorrow, we must help ourselves by substitutes.
Then money will not play any role at all. If that
is the case, then we must be ready to create the prerequisites
for that in peace.” (<span class='it'>1301-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>At a subsequent meeting of the same men on 27 May 1936, Goering
suggested a program of plant construction for the production of
synthetic substitutes but warned against the financial strain involved
in excessive overexpansion. He opposed any limitations
dictated by orthodox financial policy and stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“All measures are to be considered from the standpoint of
an assured waging of war.</p>

<p>“Ready reserves must ordinarily be accumulated already in</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On the Nurnberg Party Day in the fall of 1936, Hitler proclaimed
the establishment of the Four-Year Plan, a comprehensive
program of national self-sufficiency, and announced the appointment
of Goering as “Plenipotentiary” in charge. In October,
a decree was promulgated which implemented this announcement
and provided for the execution of the plan. (<span class='it'>1862-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is clear from Goering’s own statements in an interrogation on
25 June 1945 that the purpose of the Plan was to place Germany
on a war footing economically:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Goering: ‘My job was to organize the German economy
and my energy was put to work to get things started and
carried through * * *. My main task was to secure the
food supply for Germany for many years ahead and to make
Germany self-sufficient. The most important items were iron,
<span class='pageno' title='424' id='Page_424'></span>
petroleum and rubber. * * * The industry only wanted
to have very high grade Swedish iron for business reasons.
There was danger that during the war Germany would not
be able to get iron from Sweden and there would be no iron.’</p>

<p>Interrogator: ‘What war are you talking about? This is
1936 you’re speaking of.’</p>

<p>Goering: ‘Any possibility of war. Perhaps with Russia,
or in case there was war with anyone at any time and anywhere.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p>When asked the reasons why the Four-Year Plan lost importance
in 1942, Goering explained that his preoccupation with the Air
Force did not allow him the necessary concentration on the affairs
of the Four-Year Plan, and stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The main task of the Four-Year Plan had been accomplished.
This task was to get Germany ready.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These answers confirm the comment Goering made in 1936, that
his chief task as Plenipotentiary for the Four-Year Plan was “to
put the whole economy on a war footing within four years.”
(<span class='it'>EC-408</span>) As Plenipotentiary for the Four-Year Plan, Goering
was virtually the economic dictator for Germany with control over
all other interested Reich agencies. He was the “boss of the economy,”
and all important decisions had to be referred to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two important conferences show clearly how Goering inspired
and directed the preparation of the German economy for aggressive
war. On 8 July 1938 he addressed a number of leading German
aircraft manufacturers, explained the political situation, and
laid the groundwork for a vast increase in aircraft production.
After stating that war with Czechoslovakia was imminent and
boasting that the German air force was already superior in
quality and quantity to the English, he continued:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“If Germany wins the war, she will be the greatest power
in the world, dominating the world market, and Germany
will be a rich nation. For this goal, risks must be taken. The
only thing that matters is increased output regarding quantity
and quality. Even if the manufacturers know that their present
policies may mean their bankruptcy within three years,
they will have to do it all the same * * * I want you to
be perfectly resolved, today already, how you will run your
business when war comes. The earlier the manufacturers
make their preparations for mobilization today, the less danger
there will be of work being held up. It must be determined
for every worker whether he is essential for production
upon outbreak of war, and measures must be taken to
<span class='pageno' title='425' id='Page_425'></span>
secure his deferment in case of mobilization. (<span class='it'>3441-PS</span>). An
executive will be put in charge to work on nothing but the
complete preparation of each plant for mobilization day.”
(<span class='it'>R-140</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>A few weeks after the Munich agreement, on 14 October 1938,
another conference was held in Goering’s office. He began with
the statement that Hitler had instructed him to organize a gigantic
armament program which would make insignificant all previous
achievements. He indicated that he had been ordered to build as
rapidly as possible an air force five times as large, to increase the
speed of Army and Navy armament, and to concentrate on offensive
weapons, principally heavy artillery and heavy tanks. He
then proposed a specific program designed to accomplish these
ends. (<span class='it'>1301-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>e</span>) <span class='it'>Military Mobilization for War.</span> In his dual role as Reich
Air Minister and Commander-in-Chief of the German Air Force, it
was Goering’s function to develop the Luftwaffe to practical war
strength. As early as March 1935 Goering frankly announced to
the world that he was in the process of building a true military
air force:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“After the German government expressed willingness to help,
it became necessary to make a clear demarcation within German
aviation, namely in this respect: which air force will
be able to be made available? This situation brought about
the decision as to those of the German aviation who will in
future belong to the Air Force and those who will in future
remain in civil aviation or in sport aviation. It was necessary
to mark this separation also outwardly, so that the members
of the German Air Force became soldiers according to
the law and their leaders became officers.” (<span class='it'>2292-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Two months later, in a speech to 1,000 Air Force officers, Goering
spoke in a still bolder vein:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I repeat: I intend to create a Luftwaffe which, if the hour
should strike, shall burst upon the foe like a chorus of revenge.
The enemy must have a feeling of being lost already
before even having fought. * * *”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the same year, he signed his name to the Conscription Law
which provided for compulsory military service and constituted
an act of defiance on the part of Nazi Germany in violation of the
Versailles Treaty. (<span class='it'>1654-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Goering’s statements during this period left no doubt in the
minds of Allied diplomats that Germany was engaged in full
mobilization of air power for an impending war.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Goering and Milch often said to me or in my presence that
<span class='pageno' title='426' id='Page_426'></span>
the Nazis had decided to concentrate on air power as the
weapon of terror most likely to give Germany a dominant
position and the weapon which could be developed the most
rapidly and in the shortest time .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. High ranking
Nazis with whom I had to maintain official contact, particularly
men such as Goering, Goebbels, Ley, Frick, Frank,
Darré and others, repeatedly scoffed at my position as to the
binding character of treaties and openly stated to me that
Germany would observe her international undertakings only
so long as it suited Germany’s interests to do so.” (<span class='it'>2385-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>The Launching of Aggressive War.</span> Goering was the central
figure in the preparation of Germany for military aggression.
In German economic development and military growth he held
the key positions throughout the prewar period. Although he held
no official position in the field of foreign affairs, Goering also figured
prominently in all of the major phases of Nazi international
aggression between 1937 and 1941. As “No. 2 Nazi” he was a leading
participant in every major plan of territorial aggrandizement
or offensive military strategy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Goering was the prompter and director of the diplomatic tragi-comedy
leading to the Austrian Anschluss. In the middle of November
1937, Mr. Bullitt, the American Ambassador to France,
reported the following conversation with Goering:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I asked Goering if he meant that Germany was absolutely
determined to annex Austria to the Reich. He replied that
this was an absolute determination of the German Government.
The German Government at the present time was
not pressing this matter because of certain momentary political
considerations, especially in their relations with Italy;
but Germany would tolerate no solution of the Austrian question
other than the consolidation of Austria in the German
Reich. He then added a statement which went further than
any I have heard on this subject: He said, ‘There are schemes
being pushed now for a union of Austria, Hungary, and
Czechoslovakia, either with or without a Hapsburg at the
head of the unit. Such a solution is absolutely inacceptable
to us, and for us the conclusion of such an agreement would
be an immediate <span class='it'>casus belli</span>’.” (<span class='it'>L-151</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>When the time came, on 11 March 1938, Goering was in complete
command. Throughout the afternoon and evening of that day
he directed by telephone the activities of Seyss-Inquart, also of
Keppler, Ullrich, and the other Nazi operatives in Vienna. (<span class='it'>2949-PS</span>);
(the pertinent portions of these telephone conversations have
<span class='pageno' title='427' id='Page_427'></span>
already been referred to in Section 3 of Chapter IX on Aggression
Against Austria.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the late afternoon Goering gave the following order to Seyss-Inquart:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Now, remember the following: You go immediately together
with Lt. General Muff and tell the Federal President
that if the conditions which are known to you are not accepted
immediately, the troops who are already stationed in
and advancing to the frontier will march in tonight along
the whole line, and Austria will cease to exist.” (<span class='it'>2949-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Early the same evening he dictated to Seyss-Inquart the telegram
which the latter was to send to Berlin requesting the Nazi Government
to send German troops to “prevent bloodshed”. Two days
later he was able to call Ribbentrop in London and say:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Yes, the last march into the Rhineland is completely over-shadowed.
The Fuehrer was deeply moved, when he talked to
me last night. You must remember it was the first time that
he saw his homeland again. Now, I merely want to talk about
political things. Well, this story we have given an ultimatum,
that is just foolish gossip.” (<span class='it'>2949-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Goering played a similarly important role in the attack on
Czechoslovakia. In March of 1938, at the time of the Anschluss
with Austria, he had given a solemn assurance to the Czechoslovakian
Minister in Berlin that the developments in Austria would
in no way have a detrimental influence on the relations between
Germany and Czechoslovakia, and had emphasized the continued
earnest endeavor on the part of Germany to improve these mutual
relations. In this connection, Goering used the expression:
“<span class='it'>Ich gebe Ihnen mein Ehrenwort.</span> (I give you my word of honor)”
(<span class='it'>TC-27</span>). On the other hand, in his address to German airplane
manufacturers on 8 July 1938, he made his private views on this
subject clear:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Beyond this they fear that once we have pocketed Czechoslovakia,
we will attack Hungary, the Rumanian oil wells,
etc. Moreover, since there are democratic countries on the
one hand, and authoritarian ones on the other, there is enough
inflammable matter in the world anyway. When, how and
where this inflammable matter will explode, no one among
us can say. It may happen within some months, but it may
also take some years. At present, the situation is this that
Czechoslovakia has promised the Sudeten Germans to meet
them half way. I am convinced that they will satisfy no
more than some of their unimportant demands. Such action
on their part would probably suit our policy best, since in
<span class='pageno' title='428' id='Page_428'></span>
this case we could put the entire responsibility on England
because she has engaged herself so deeply in this business.”
(<span class='it'>R-140</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>On 14 October 1938, shortly after the Munich agreement, Goering
gave his views on the Czechoslovakian question at a conference
in the Air Ministry:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Sudetenland has to be exploited with all the means.
General Field Marshal Goering counts upon a complete industrial
assimilation of the Slovakia. Czech and Slovakia
would become German dominions. Everything possible must
be taken out. The Oder-Danube Canal has to be speeded up.
Searches for oil and ore have to be conducted in Slovakia,
notably by State Secretary Keppler.” (<span class='it'>1301-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Meanwhile, he was deceiving the representatives of the puppet
Slovakian government to the same end:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Field Marshal considers that the Slovak negotiations
toward independence are to be supported in a suitable manner.
Czechoslovakia without Slovakia is still more at our
mercy.” (<span class='it'>2801-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>In the following year, with the rape of Czechoslovakia complete
Goering frankly stated what Germany’s purpose had been
throughout the whole affair:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In a rather long statement the field marshal explained that
the incorporation of Bohemia and Moravia into the German
economy had taken place, among other reasons to increase
the German War potential by exploitation of the industry
there.” (<span class='it'>R-133</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Goering was also a moving force in the later crimes against the
peace. As the successor designate to Hitler, as Chief of the Air
Forces, and as economic czar of Greater Germany, he was a party
to all the planning for military operations of the Nazi forces in
the East and the West. In the Polish affair, for example, it was
Goering who in 1935 gave assurances to the Polish government
that “there should be not the slightest fear in Poland that on the
German side it (the German-Polish alliance) would not be continued
in the future.” Yet, four years later, Goering helped formulate
plans for the invasion of Polish territory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With regard to the attack upon the Soviet Union, plans for the
ruthless exploitation of Russian territory were made months in
advance of the opening of hostilities. Goering was placed in
charge of this army of spoliation, whose mission was that of
“seizing raw materials and taking over all important concerns.”
(<span class='it'>1317-PS</span>; <span class='it'>1157-PS</span>.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>These specific instances cover only a small part of Goering’s
<span class='pageno' title='429' id='Page_429'></span>
activities in the field of aggressive war. There follows a partial
list of additional documents which demonstrate Goering’s knowledge
of and continued participation in the Nazi war program.
They deal either with conferences on the highest war-planning
levels which he attended, or with secret orders communicated to

<h3>B. <span class='it'>WAR CRIMES.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Forced Labor, Deportation, and Enslavement of Residents
of Occupied Territories.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The slave labor program of the Nazi conspirators had two
criminal purposes. The first was to satisfy the labor requirements
of the Nazi war machine by forcing residents of occupied countries
to work in Germany, often directly in the German armament
industry, and the second was to destroy or weaken the
peoples of the occupied territories. Millions of foreign workers
were taken to Germany, for the most part under pressure and
generally by physical force. These workers were forced to labor
under conditions of undescribable brutality and degredation, and
<span class='pageno' title='431' id='Page_431'></span>
often they were used in factories and industries devoted exclusively
to the production of munitions of war. (<span class='it'>See Chapter X
on The Slave Labor Program.</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Goering was at all times implicated in the slave labor program.
Recruitment and allocation of manpower and determination of
working conditions were included in his jurisdiction as Plenipotentiary
for the Four-Year Plan, and from its beginning a
part of the Four-Year Plan Office was devoted to such work.
(<span class='it'>1862-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2827-PS</span>.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The defendant Goering was present at a meeting in Hitler’s
study on 23 May 1939 at which Hitler, after declaring his intention
to attack Poland at the first suitable opportunity, said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“If fate brings us into conflict with the West, the possession
of extensive areas in the East will be advantageous. * * *
The population of non-German areas will perform no military
service and will be available as a source of labor.”
(<span class='it'>L-79</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after the fall of Poland, Goering as Plenipotentiary for
the Four-Year Plan, began the enslavement of large numbers of
Poles. On 25 January 1940, the defendant Frank, then Governor
General of Poland, reported to Goering as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“For the execution of the task of systematically placing the
economic strength of the Generalgouvernement, within the
framework of the Four-Year Plan, in the service of the German
defense industry, I give the following</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'><span class='it'>DIRECTIVES</span></p>

<p>“1. In view of the present requirements of the Reich for
the defense industry, it is at present fundamentally impossible
to carry on a long-term economic policy in the Generalgouvernement.
Rather, it is necessary so to steer the economy
of the Generalgouvernement that it will, in the shortest possible
time, accomplish results representing the maximum that
can be gotten out of the economic strength of the Generalgouvernement
for immediate strengthening of our capacity
for defense. * * *</p>

<p>“2. (g) Supply and transportation of at least 1 million male
and female agricultural and industrial workers to the Reich—among
them at least 7500 000 [sic] agricultural workers
of which at least 50% must be women—in order to guarantee
agricultural production in the Reich and as a replacement
for industrial workers lacking in the Reich. * * *”
(<span class='it'>1375-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That orders for this enormous number of workers originated
<span class='pageno' title='432' id='Page_432'></span>
with the defendant Goering is clear from the following statement
in Frank’s Diary for 10 May 1940:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Then the Governor General deals with the problem of the
<span class='it'>Compulsory Labor Service</span> of the Poles. Upon the demands
from the Reich it has now been decreed that compulsion may
be exercised in view of the fact that sufficient manpower was
not voluntarily available for service inside the German
Reich. This compulsion means the possibility of arrest of
male and female Poles. Because of these measures a certain
disquietude had developed which, according to individual reports,
was spreading very much, and which might produce
difficulties everywhere. General Fieldmarshal Goering some
time ago pointed out in his long speech the necessity to deport
into the Reich a million workers. The supply so far was
160,000. However, great difficulties had to be overcome.
Therefore it would be advisable to consult the district and
town chiefs in the execution of the compulsion, so that one
could be sure from the start that this action would be reasonably
successful. The arrest of young Poles when leaving
church service or the cinema would bring about an increasing
nervousness of the Poles. Generally speaking, he had no
objections at all if the rubbish, capable of work yet often
loitering about, would be snatched from the streets. The
best method for this, however, would be the organization of
a raid, and it would be absolutely justifiable to stop a Pole in
the street and to question him what he was doing, where he
was working, etc.” (<span class='it'>2233-A-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Goering was also responsible for the harsh treatment given
these workers when they reached Germany. On 8 March 1940, as
Plenipotentiary of the Four-Year Plan and as Chairman of the
Cabinet Counsel for the Defense of the Reich, he issued a directive
to the Supreme Reich authorities, entitled: “Treatment of
male and female civilian workers of Polish Nationality in the
Reich.” In this directive Goering provided in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The mass employment of male and female civilian workers
of Polish nationality in the Reich necessitates a comprehensive
ruling on treatment of these workers.</p>

<p>“The following orders are to be executed at once:</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“4. The blameless conduct of the Poles is to be assured by
special regulations. The legal and administrative regulations,
necessary for this, will be issued by the Reichsfuehrer-SS
and Chief of the German Police at the Reich Ministry of
the Interior.
<span class='pageno' title='433' id='Page_433'></span></p>

<p>“6. Attention is drawn to the explanations enclosed as appendix.”
(<span class='it'>R-148</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Attached to this directive, and also dated 8 March 1940, were a
series of regulations issued by Himmler, as Reichfuehrer SS and
Chief of the German Police. These regulations provided for
stringent measures and discrimination against Polish workers in
the Reich. In a covering Express Letter addressed to all State
Police district-offices and State Police offices, also dated 8 March
1940, Himmler made clear what was intended in order to secure
“blameless conduct”. He stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The steps to be taken to combat insubordination and noncompliance
with the duty to work, must be decided according
to the severity of the case and to the spirit of resistance of
the offender. It is of most importance that they be taken
immediately after the offense is committed so that they have
a decisive effect. In accordance with my instructions in the
appended decrees, especially severe measures must be taken
during the first eight weeks, in order to bring home to the
workers of Polish nationality from the outset the consequences
of noncompliance with the orders issued. * * *</p>

<p>“In general, in all cases where a warning, by the State Police
or a short imprisonment is not sufficient to induce the worker
to fulfill his duties, application is to be made for his transfer
to a labor training camp, and an opinion given on what
treatment he should receive there. The treatment in the
labor training camps will have to be in accordance with, the
severity of the offense. It is suitable, e.g., to make obstinate
shirkers work in the stone-quarries of the Mauthausen camp.
By a special decree, to the heads of SS-Deathshead Units and
concentration camps, I have ordered that the treatment of
these persons under protective custody be undertaken in a
concentration camp.</p>

<p>“Extraordinarily serious cases have to be reported to the
Chief of the Security Police and the SD who, after examination,
make the decision on a special treatment of the workers
of Polish nationality in question.” (<span class='it'>R-148</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 29 January 1942 the Division for the Employment of Labor
in the Four-Year Plan Office issued a circular, signed by Dr.
Mansfeld, the General Delegate for Labor Employment in the
Four-Year Plan Office, and addressed to various civilian and
military authorities in the occupied territories, explaining the various
means to be used to force workers to go to Germany. The
circular provides in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Subject: Increased mobilization of man-power for the German
<span class='pageno' title='434' id='Page_434'></span>
Reich from the occupied territories and preparations
for mobilization by force.</p>

<p>“On the one hand, the labor shortage which was rendered
more acute by the draft for the Wehrmacht, and on the other
hand, the increased scope of the armament problem in the
German Reich, render it necessary that manpower for service
in the Reich be recruited from the occupied territories to a
much greater extent than heretofore, in order to relieve the
shortage of labor. Therefore, any and all methods must be
adopted which make possible the transportation, without exception
and delay, for employment in the German Reich, of
manpower in the occupied territories which is unemployed
or which can be released for use in Germany after most careful
screening.</p>

<p>“This mobilization shall first of all, as heretofore, be carried
out on a voluntary basis. For this reason, the recruiting
effort for employment in the German Reich must be strengthened
considerably. But if satisfactory results are to be obtained,
the German authorities, who are functioning in the
occupied territories, must be able to exert any pressure
necessary to support the voluntary recruiting of labor for
employment in Germany. Accordingly, to the extent that
may be necessary, the regulations in force in the occupied
territories in regard to shift in employment and withdrawal
of support upon refusal to work, must be tightened. Supplementary
regulations concerning shift in employment must
above all insure that older personnel who are freed must be
exchanged for younger personnel to make up for it, so that
the latter may be made available for the Reich. A far-reaching
decrease in the amount of relief granted by Public Welfare
must also be effected in order to induce laborers to accept
employment in the Reich. Unemployment relief must be
set so low that the amount in comparison with the average
wages in the Reich and the possibilities there for sending remittances
home may serve as an inducement to accept employment
in the Reich. When refusal to accept work in the
Reich is not justified, the compensation must be reduced to
an amount barely enough for subsistence, or even be cancelled.
In this connection, partial withdrawal of ration cards
and assignment to particularly heavy obligatory labor may
be considered.</p>

<p>“However, all misgivings must give way before the necessity
of supplying the deficit in manpower caused by excessive
draft calls into the Armed Forces, in order to avoid detriment
<span class='pageno' title='435' id='Page_435'></span>
to the armament industry. For this purpose the forcible
mobilization of workers from the occupied territories
cannot be disregarded, in case the voluntary recruiting is
unsuccessful. The mere possibility of mobilization by force
will, in many cases, make recruiting easier.</p>

<p>“Therefore, I ask you immediately to take any measures in
your district which will promote the employment of workers
in the German Reich on a voluntary basis. I herewith request
you to prepare for publication regulations applying to
forced mobilization of laborers from your territory for Germany,
so that they may be decreed at once, in case recruiting
on a voluntary basis will not have the desired result, that
is relief of the manpower shortage in the Reich. I request
you to inform me of the measures taken by you.” (<span class='it'>1183-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 21 March 1942, Hitler promulgated a decree appointing
Sauckel Plenipotentiary General for Man Power. This decree
provided in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“In order to secure the manpower requisite for the war industries
as a whole, and particularly for armaments, it is
necessary that the utilization of all available manpower, including
that of workers recruited [erwerben] abroad and of
prisoners of war, should be subject to a uniform control, directed
in a manner appropriate to the requirements of war
industry, and further that all still incompletely utilized manpower
in the Greater German Reich, including the Protectorate,
and in the General Government and in the occupied
territories, should be mobilized.</p>

<p>“Reichsstatthalter and Gauleiter Fritz Sauckel will carry out
this task within the framework of the Four-Year Plan, as
plenipotentiary general, for the employment of manpower. In
that capacity he will be directly responsible to the Commissioner
for the Four-Year Plan.” (<span class='it'>1666-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 27 March 1942, Goering, as Plenipotentiary for the Four-Year
Plan, issued a decree in pursuance of the Fuehrer’s decree
of 21 March 1942. This decree provided:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“In pursuance of the Fuehrer’s Decree of 21 March 1942
(RGBl I, 179), I decree as follows:</p>

<p>“1. My manpower sections (<span class='it'>Geschaeftsgruppen Arbeitseinsatz</span>)
are hereby abolished (circular letter of 22 Oct 1936/
St M. Dev. 265). Their duties (recruitment and allocation
of manpower, regulations for labor conditions (<span class='it'>Arbeitsbedingungen</span>))
are taken over by the Plenipotentiary General for
Arbeitseinsatz, who is directly under me.</p>

<p>“2. The Plenipotentiary General for Arbeitseinsatz will be
<span class='pageno' title='436' id='Page_436'></span>
responsible for regulating the conditions of labor (wage policy)
employed in the Reich Territory, having regard to the
requirements of Arbeitseinsatz.</p>

<p>“3. The Plenipotentiary General for Arbeitseinsatz is part
of the Four-Year Plan. In cases where new legislation is required,
or existing laws required to be modified, he will submit
appropriate proposals to me.</p>

<p>“4. The Plenipotentiary General for Arbeitseinsatz will have
at his disposal for the performance of his task the right
delegated to me by the Fuehrer for issuing instructions to
the higher Reich authorities, their branches and the Party
offices, and their associated organisms and also the Reich
Protector, the General Governor, the Commander-in-Chief,
and heads of the civil administrations. In the case of ordinances
and instructions of fundamental importance a report
is to be submitted to me in advance.” (<span class='it'>1666-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Since Sauckel was an authority of the Four-Year Plan, it is
clear that Goering remains responsible for the war crimes committed
by Sauckel as Plenipotentiary-General for Manpower. (<span class='it'>See
Chapter X on The Slave Labor Program.</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Employment of Prisoners of War in War Industry.</span> The
Nazi conspirators ordered prisoners of war to work under dangerous
conditions, and in the manufacturing and transportation
of arms or munitions, in violation of the Laws of War and of
Articles 31 and 32 of the Geneva Convention of 27 July 1929 on
Prisoners of War. (<span class='it'>See Chapter X on The Illegal Use of Prisoners
of War.</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Goering had a part in these crimes. At a conference on 7 November
1941, the subject of which was the employment of Russians,
including Russian prisoners of war, it appears from a
memorandum signed by Koerner, State Secretary to the defendant
Goering as Plenipotentiary for the Four-Year Plan, that Goering
gave the following directives for use of Russians as laborers:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I. <span class='it'>The stronger labor reserves in the zone of the interior
are also decisive for the war.</span></p>

<p>“The Russian workers have proved their productive capacity
during the development of the huge Russian industry. Therefore
it must be made available to the Reich from now on. Objections
against this order of the Fuehrer are of the secondary
nature. The disadvantages which can be created by the
Arbeitseinsatz have to be reduced to a minimum: the task
especially of counter-intelligence and security police.</p>

<p>“II. <span class='it'>The Russian in the zone of operations.</span>
<span class='pageno' title='437' id='Page_437'></span></p>

<p>“He is to be employed particularly in building roads and
railroads, in clearing work, clearing of mines and in building
airports. The German construction battalions have to be
dissolved to a great extent (Example: Air Forces!); the German
skilled workers belong to the war industry; it is not their
task to shovel and to break stones, the Russian is there for
that.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“IV. <span class='it'>The Russian in the Reich territory including the Protectorate.</span></p>

<p>“The number of the employed depends on the requirement.
By determining the requirement, it is to be considered that
workers of other states who produce little and eat much are
to be shipped out of the Reich and that in the future the
German woman should come less into the foreground in the
labor process. Beside the Russian prisoners of war, free
Russian workers should also be used.</p>

<p>“A. <span class='it'>The Russian Prisoner of War.</span></p>

<p>“1. The <span class='it'>selection</span> has to take place already in the collecting
camps, beyond the Reich border. The profession and physical
condition are decisive. At the same time screening as to nationality
and according to the requirements of the security
police and counter-intelligence must take place.</p>

<p>“2. The <span class='it'>transportation</span> has to be organized just as the selection
and not improvised. The prisoners are to be forwarded
rapidly. Their feeding should be orderly and their guarding
unconditionally secured.</p>

<p>“3. <span class='it'>Officers</span> are to be excluded from the work as much as
possible, <span class='it'>commissars</span> as a matter of principle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Looting and Destruction of Works of Art.</span> The Nazi conspirators
<span class='pageno' title='439' id='Page_439'></span>
planned and organized the cultural impoverishment of
every country in Europe: the plunder of works of art by the
Government General in occupied Poland and the activities of the
Einsatzstab Rosenberg are outstanding examples. (<span class='it'>See Chapter
XIV on the Plunder of Art Treasures.</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Goering was continuously connected with these activities. In
October 1939 he requested a Dr. Kajetan Muehlmann to undertake
immediately the “securing” of all Polish art treasures. In an
affidavit, Dr. Muehlmann states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I was the special deputy of the Governor General of Poland,
Hans Frank, for the safeguarding of art treasures in the
General Government, October 1939 to September 1943.</p>

<p>“Goering, in his function as chairman of the Reich Defense
Council, had commissioned me with this duty.</p>

<p>“I confirm, that it was the official policy of the Governor General,
Hans Frank, to take into custody all important art treasures,
which belonged to Polish public institutions, private
collections and the Church. I confirm, that the art treasures,
mentioned, were actually confiscated, and it is clear to me,
that they would not have remained in Poland in case of a
German victory, but that they would have been used to complement
German artistic property.” (<span class='it'>3042-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Indicative of the continued interest taken by Goering in these
operations, it appears from Dr. Muehlmann’s report that at one
time 31 valuable sketches by the artist Albrecht Durer were taken
from a Polish collection and personally handed to the defendant
Goering, who took them to the Fuehrer’s headquarters. (<span class='it'>1709-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The part played by Goering in looting of art by the <span class='it'>Einsatzstab
Rosenberg</span> has been shown in Chapter XIV. On 5 November
1940 Goering issued an order under his own signature directed
to the Chief of the Military Administration Paris, and to the
<span class='it'>Einsatzstab Rosenberg</span>, as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“In conveying the measures taken until now, for the securing
of Jewish art property by the Chief of the Military Administration
Paris and the special service staff Rosenberg (the
Chief of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces 2 f
28.14. W.Z.Nr 3812/40 g), the art objects brought to the
Louvre will be disposed of in the following way:</p>

<p>“1. Those art objects about which the Fuehrer has reserved
for himself the decision as to their use.</p>

<p>“2. Those art objects which serve to the completion of the
Reich Marshal’s collection.</p>

<p>“3. Those art objects and library stocks the use of which
seem useful to the establishing of the higher institutes of
<span class='pageno' title='440' id='Page_440'></span>
learning and which come within the jurisdiction of Reichsleiter
Rosenberg.</p>

<p>“4. Those art objects that are suited to be sent to German
museums, of all these art objects a systematic inventory will
be made by the special purpose staff Rosenberg; they will
then be packed and shipped to Germany with the assistance
of the Luftwaffe.” (<span class='it'>141-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In view of the high priority afforded by the foregoing order
to the completion of Goering’s own collection, it is not surprising
to find that he continued to aid the operations of the <span class='it'>Einsatzstab
Rosenberg</span>. Thus, on 1 May 1941, Goering issued an order to all
Party, State, and Wehrmacht Services, under his own signature,
requesting them—</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * to give all possible support and assistance to the
Chief of Staff of Reichsleiter Rosenberg’s staffs. * * *
The above-mentioned persons are requested to report to us
on their work, particularly on any difficulties that might
arise.” (<span class='it'>1117-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>By 30 May 1942, Goering was able to boast of the assistance
which he had rendered to the work of the <span class='it'>Einsatzstab Rosenberg</span>.
In a letter to Rosenberg, of that date, he stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * On the other hand I also support personally the
work of your Einsatzstab wherever I can do so, and a great
part of the seized cultural goods can be accounted for because
I was able to assist the Einsatzstab with my organization.”
(<span class='it'>1015-I-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>Germanization and Spoliation.</span> With respect to Poland
the Nazi conspirators’ plans for Germanization and spoliation
commenced with the incorporation of the four western provinces
of Poland into the German Reich. In the remaining portions occupied
by Germany they set up the Government General. The
Nazis planned to Germanize the so-called incorporated territories
ruthlessly by deporting Polish intelligentsia, Jews, and dissident
elements to the Government General, for eventual elimination;
by confiscating Polish property, particularly farms; by sending
those so deprived of their property to Germany as laborers; and
by importing German settlers. It was specifically planned to exploit
the people and material resources of the territory within
the Government General by taking whatever was needed to
strengthen the Nazi war machine, thus impoverishing this region
and reducing it to a vassal state. (<span class='it'>See Chapter XIII on Germanization
and Spoliation.</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Goering, together with Hitler, Lammers, Frick, and Hess,
<span class='pageno' title='441' id='Page_441'></span>
signed the decree purporting to incorporate certain parts of Polish
territory into the Reich. (Decree of the Fuehrer and Reich
Chancellor concerning the Organization and Administration of
the Eastern Territories, 8 October 1939, 1939 Reichsgesetzblatt,
Part I, p. 2042.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Purporting to act by virtue of section 8 of the foregoing decree,
Goering, as Plenipotentiary for the Four-Year Plan, signed an
order concerning the introduction of the Four-Year Plan in the
Eastern Territories. (Order concerning the Introduction of the
Four-Year Plan in the Eastern Territories, 30 October 1939, 1939
Reichsgesetzblatt, Part I, p. 2125.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Goering in a directive dated 19 October 1939 stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“In the meeting of October 13th, I have given detailed instructions
for the economical administration of the occupied
territories. I will repeat them here in short: 1. The task for
the economic treatment of the various administrative regions
is different depending on whether a country is involved which
will be incorporated politically into the German Reich or
whether we deal with the Government General, which, in all
probability, will not be made a part of Germany.</p>

<p>“In the first mentioned territories the reconstruction and expansion
of the economy, the safeguarding of all their production
facilities and supplies must be aimed at, as well as a
complete incorporation into the Greater German economic
system at the earliest possible time. On the other hand there
must be removed from the territories of the Government General
all raw materials, scrap materials, machines, etc., which
are of use for the German war economy. Enterprises which
are not absolutely necessary for the meager maintenance of
the naked existence of the population must be transferred
to Germany, unless such transfer would require an unreasonably
long period of time and would make it more practical to
exploit those enterprises by giving them German orders to
be executed at their present location.” (<span class='it'>EC-410</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Goering acted as chairman of a meeting on 12 February 1940
to discuss “questions concerning the East,” attended also by
Himmler and Frank. From the minutes of this meeting it appears:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“By way of introduction, the General Field Marshal explained
that the strengthening of the war potential of the Reich must
be the chief aim of all measures to be taken in the East.”
(<span class='it'>EC-305</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The hand of Goering may also be found in the remainder of
the Nazi plans for Poland. It was he, for example, who signed,
with Hitler and Keitel, the secret decree which entrusted Himmler
<span class='pageno' title='442' id='Page_442'></span>
with the task of executing the Germanization program
(<span class='it'>686-PS</span>). Similarly, it was Goering who, by virtue of his powers
as Plenipotentiary for the Four-Year Plan, issued a decree concerning
confiscations in the incorporated eastern territories. This
decree applied to “property of citizens of the former Polish State
within the territory of the Greater German Reich, including the
incorporated Eastern Territories”, and provided in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“<span class='sc'>Section 1.</span> (1) The property of citizens of the former Polish
State within the territory of the Greater German Reich,
including the incorporated Eastern territories, shall be subject

<p>“(2) Subsection 1 shall not apply to the property of persons
who, in accordance with Section 6 of the decree of the Fuehrer
and Reich Chancellor relating to the organization and administration
of the Eastern Territories of October 8, 1935

<p><span class='sc'>Section 9.</span> (1) Sequestrated property may be confiscated by
the competent agency (Section 12) for the benefit of the German

the Reich, or the strengthening of Germanism, so requires.”
(<span class='it'>1665-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The spoliation of Soviet territory and resources and the barbarous
treatment inflicted on Soviet citizens were the result of
plans long made and carefully drawn up by the Nazis before they
launched their aggressive war on the Soviet Union. The Nazis
planned to destroy the industrial potential of the northern regions
occupied by their armies and to administer the production
<span class='pageno' title='443' id='Page_443'></span>
of food in the south and southeast, which normally produced a
surplus of food, in such a way that the population of the northern
region would inevitably be reduced to starvation because of diversion
of such surplus food to the German Reich. The Nazis
also planned to incorporate Galicia and all the Baltic countries into
Germany and to convert the Crimea, an area north of the Crimea,
the Volga territory, and the district around Baku into German
colonies. Their plans were to Germanize or destroy. (<span class='it'>See Chapter
XIII on Germanization and Spoliation.</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>By 29 April 1941, seven weeks prior to the invasion of the
Soviet Union, it appears that Hitler had entrusted Goering with
the over-all direction of the economic administration in the area
of operations and in the areas under political administration. It
further appears that Goering had set up an economic staff and
subsidiary authorities to carry out this function. (<span class='it'>1157-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The form of organization thus created by Goering and the duties
of its various sections appear more clearly in a set of directives
“for the operation of the economy in the newly occupied territories”
issued by Goering, as Reich Marshal of the Greater German
Reich in July 1941. By the terms of these directives, it is
stated “The Orders of the Reich Marshal cover all economic fields,
including nutrition and agriculture. They are to be executed by
the subordinate economic offices.” An “Economic Staff, East” was
charged with the execution of orders transmitted to it from higher
authority. One subdivision of this staff, entitled “Group La”, was
charged with the following functions: “Nutrition and Agriculture,
the economy of all agricultural products, provision of supplies for
the Army, in cooperation with the Army groups concerned.”
(<span class='it'>EC-472</span>; <span class='it'>1743-PS</span>.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>As appears from the foregoing documents, it was a subdivision
of the economic organization set by Goering, the Economic Staff,
East, Agricultural Group, which rendered a top secret report on
23 May 1941, containing a set of policy directives for the exploitation
of Soviet agriculture. These directives contemplated abandonment
of all industry in the food deficit regions, with certain
exceptions, and the diversion of food from the food surplus regions
to German needs, even though millions of people would inevitably
die of starvation as a result. (<span class='it'>EC-126</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Minutes of a meeting at Hitler’s Headquarters on 16 July 1941,
kept by Bormann, disclose Hitler’s announcement that the Nazis
never intended to leave the countries then being occupied by
their Armies. The Fuehrer further declared that although the
rest of the world was to be deceived on this point, nevertheless,
“this need not prevent us taking all necessary measures—shooting,
<span class='pageno' title='444' id='Page_444'></span>
desettling, etc.—and we shall take them,” and he discussed
making the Crimea and other parts of Russia into German colonies.
Goering was present and participated in this conference.
(<span class='it'>L-221</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a final illustration, it appears from a memorandum dated
16 September 1941 that Goering presided over a meeting of
German military officials concerned with the “better exploitation
of the occupied territories for the German food economy” and that
in discussing this topic, Goering said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“It is clear that a graduated scale of food allocations is
needed.</p>

<p>“First in line are the <span class='it'>combat troops</span>, then the remainder of
troops in <span class='it'>enemy territory</span>, and then those <span class='it'>troops stationed at
home</span>. The rates are adjusted accordingly. The supply of the
<span class='it'>German</span> non-military population follows and only then comes
the <span class='it'>population of the occupied territories</span>.</p>

<p>“In the occupied territories on principle only those people
are to be supplied with an adequate amount of food who
work for us. Even if one <span class='it'>wanted</span> to feed all the other inhabitants,
one <span class='it'>could not</span> do it in the newly occupied eastern areas.
It is, therefore, wrong to funnel off food supplies for this
purpose, if it is done at the expense of the Army and necessitates
increased supplies from home.” (<span class='it'>EC-3</span>)</p>

</div>

<h3>C. <span class='it'>CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Murder, Extermination, Enslavement, Deportation, and
other Inhumane Acts Committed against Civilian Populations before
and during the War.</span> In 1936, Himmler became Chief of the
German Police. Goering was thereafter able to devote his attention
chiefly to the tasks of creating the German Air Force and
preparing the nation economically for aggressive war. As was
inevitable from his position, however, Goering continued to be
concerned from time to time with the institutions of his creation,
such as the Gestapo and the concentration camps. For example,
on 14 February 1944, he sent the following teletype to Himmler:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I received your request to form another squadron of air
force group for special purposes 7 (Z.B.V.7) and ordered
examination by the air force operational staff [<span class='it'>Luftwaffenfuerungstab</span>].
At the same time I ask you to put at my disposal
as great a number of concentration camp [K Z—] convicts
as possible for air armament, as this kind of manpower
proved to be very useful according to previous experience.
The situation of the air war makes subterranean transfer of
<span class='pageno' title='445' id='Page_445'></span>
industry necessary. For work of this kind concentration
camp [K Z—] convicts can be especially well concentrated
at work and in the camp. Such installations are necessary in
order to secure production of the now fully developed most
modern airplanes. The Fuehrer upon his visit in Insterburg
has attached great value to these airplanes. Intermediate negotiations
have already been held between my and your departments.
I would be especially grateful for your support
in carrying out this task.” (<span class='it'>1584-I-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>On 9 March 1944 Himmler replied to the foregoing teletype as
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Most honored Reichsmarshal:</p>

<p>“Following my teletype letter of the 18 February 1944 I herewith
transmit a survey on the employment of prisoners in
the aviation industry.</p>

<p>“This survey indicates that at the present time about <span class='it'>36,000
prisoners</span> are employed for the purposes of the air force. An
increase to a total of <span class='it'>90,000 prisoners</span> is contemplated.</p>

<p>“The production is being discussed, established and executed
between the Reich Ministry of Aviation and the chief of my
Economic-Administrative Main Office, SS-Obergruppenfuehrer
and General of the Waffen-SS, Pohl respectively.</p>

<p>“We assist with all forces at our disposal.”</p>

</div>

<p>There follows a report on the use of concentration camp prisoners
in the aviation industry. (<span class='it'>1584-III-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Chapter XI on Concentration Camps and Chapter XV, section
5, on the SS, reference is made to medical experiments performed
on humans at the concentration camp in Dachau. On 20
May 1942, Field Marshal Milch, Secretary of State and Deputy to
Goering as Air Minister, wrote to SS-Obergruppenfuehrer Wolff
the following letter:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Dear Wolffy:</p>

<p>“In reference to your telegram of 12 May our sanitary inspector
reports to me that the altitude experiments carried
out by the SS and Air Force at Dachau have been finished.
Any continuation of these experiments seems essentially unreasonable.
However, the carrying out of experiments of
some other kind, in regard to perils at high seas, would be
important. These have been prepared in immediate agreement
with the proper offices; Major (M.C.) Weltz will be
charged with the execution and Capt. (M.C.) Rascher will
be made available until further orders in addition to his duties
within the Medical Corps of the Air Corps. A change of
<span class='pageno' title='446' id='Page_446'></span>
these measures does not appear necessary, and an enlargement
of the task is not considered pressing at this time.</p>

<p>“The low-pressure chamber would not be needed for these
low-temperature experiments. It is urgently needed at another
place and therefore can no longer remain in Dachau.</p>

<p>“I convey the special thanks from the supreme commander
of the Air Corps to the SS for their extensive cooperation.</p>

<p>“I remain with best wishes for you and in good comradeship
and with</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>Heil Hitler!</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:0em;'>Always yours</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>/s/ E. Milch” (<span class='it'>343-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p>That Milch kept informed of the progress of the experiments may
be seen from the following letter which he sent to Himmler on
31 August 1942:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Dear Mr. Himmler:</p>

<p>“I thank you very much for your letter of the 25 Aug. I
have read with great interest the reports of Dr. Rascher and
Dr. Romberg. I am informed about the current experiments.
I shall ask the two gentlemen to give a lecture combined with
the showing of motion pictures to my men in the near future.</p>

<p>“Hoping that it will be possible for me to see you at the occasion
of my next visit to Headquarters I remain with best regards
and</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>Heil Hitler!</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>/s/ yours</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>E. Milch” (<span class='it'>343-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thus it is clear that the highest circles in the Air Ministry, of
which Goering was the head, were interested in these experiments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Persecution of the Jews.</span> As was to be expected from his
position as Number 2 Nazi, Goering took an active part in the
waging of the Nazi program of persecution, the ultimate purpose
of which was the extermination of all Jews. To quote from
Goering’s own book:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The solution of the Jewish question has not yet been
reached. Whatever has happened so far has been done in a
state of necessity, in the interest of our own people; it was
a reaction against the ruin which this race has brought upon
us.” (<span class='it'>3461-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In 1935, Goering, as President of the Reichstag, in a speech
urging that body to pass the Nurnberg race laws, said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“God has created the races. He did not want equality and
therefore we energetically reject any attempt to falsify the
<span class='pageno' title='447' id='Page_447'></span>
concept of race purity by making it equivalent with racial
equality. * * * This equality does not exist. We have
never accepted such an idea and therefore we must reject it
in our laws likewise and must accept that purity of race
which nature and providence have destined for us.”
(<span class='it'>3458-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Again, on 26 March 1938, Goering said in a speech in Vienna:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I must direct a serious word to the City of Vienna. Today
Vienna cannot rightly claim to be a German City. One cannot
speak of a German City in which 300,000 Jews live. This
city has an important German mission in the field of culture
as well as in economics. For neither of these can we make use
of the Jews.” (<span class='it'>3460-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the late fall of 1938, using as an excuse the murder of von
Rath, Secretary of the German Legation in Paris, the Nazi conspirators,
acting within the frame-work of economic preparation
for aggressive war, began the complete elimination of Jews from
economic life, preparatory to their physical annihilation. Goering
as head of the Four-Year Plan, was in active charge of this phase
of the persecutions. The first step in his campaign was a law requiring
registration of all Jewish-owned property. In April 1938
Goering and Frick signed such a law (<span class='it'>1406-PS</span>). Armed with the
information thus secured, the Nazi conspirators were fully prepared
to take the next step. The killing of von Rath in Paris on
9 November 1938 was made the pretext for widespread “spontaneous”
riots, which included the looting and burning of many
Jewish synagogues, homes, and shops, all of which were carefully
organized and supervised by the Nazi conspirators. Goering was
fully informed of measures taken. (<span class='it'>3051-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3058-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately after these riots, on 12 November 1938, Goering
acted as Chairman of a meeting at the Reich Ministry of Air, on
the “Jewish question,” attended by Funk, Goebbels, Heydrich, and
others (<span class='it'>1816-PS</span>). Goering made the purpose of the meeting
clear at the outset. He said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Today’s meeting is of a decisive nature. I have received a
letter written on the Fuehrer’s orders by the Stabsleiter of
the Fuehrer’s deputy, Bormann, requesting that the ‘Jewish
Question be now, once and for all, coordinated and solved
one way or another. And yesterday, once again did the
Fuehrer request by ‘phone for me to take coordinated action
in the matter’.</p>

<p>“Since the problem is mainly an economic one, it is from an
economic angle that it shall have to be tackled. Naturally
a number of legal measures shall have to be taken which
<span class='pageno' title='448' id='Page_448'></span>
fall into the sphere of the Minister for Justice and into that
of the Minister of the Interior; and certain propaganda measures
shall have to be taken care of by the office of the Minister
for Propaganda. The Minister for Finance and the Minister
for Economic Affairs shall take care of problems falling
into their respective resorts.” (<span class='it'>1816-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Goering then said that it was not sufficient to have demonstrations
and to burn down Jewish property. In such cases the real
loss usually fell on German insurance companies. He continued:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I should not want to leave any doubt, gentlemen, as to the
aim of today’s meeting. We have not come together merely
to talk again but to make decisions, and I implore the competent
agencies to take all measures for elimination of the
Jews from German economy and to submit them to me, as far
as it is necessary.</p>

<p>“The fundamental idea in this program of elimination of
the Jew from German economy, is first, the Jew being
ejected from the economy transfers his property to the State.
He will be compensated. The compensation is to be listed in
the debit ledger and shall bring a certain percentage of interest.
The Jew shall have to live out of this interest. It is
a foregone conclusion, that this aryanizing, if it is to be
done quickly, cannot be made in the Ministry for Economy in
Berlin. That way, we would never finish * * *.</p>

<p>“It is my lot, so that the damage will not be greater than the
profit, which we are striving for.</p>

<p>“It is obvious, gentlemen, that the Jewish stores are for the
people, and not the stores. Therefore, we must begin here,
according to the rules previously laid down.</p>

<p>“The Minister for Economic Affairs shall announce which
stores he’ll want to close altogether. These stores are excluded
from aryanizing at once. Their stocks are to be made
available for sale in other stores; what cannot be sold, shall
be processed through the “Winterhilfe” or taken care of
otherwise. However, the sales values of these articles shall always
be considered, since the State is not to suffer but should
profit through this transformation. For the Chain and Department
stores—I speak now only of that, which can be
seen, certain categories have to be established, according to
the importance of the various branches.</p>

<p>“The trustee of the State will estimate the value of the
property and decide what amount the Jew shall receive.
Naturally, this amount is to be set as low as possible. The
representative of the State shall then turn the establishment
<span class='pageno' title='449' id='Page_449'></span>
over to the “Arian” proprietor, that is, the property shall be
sold according to its real value.</p>

<p>“There begins the difficulties. It is easily understood that
strong attempt will be made to get all these stores to Party
members and to let them have some kind of compensations.
I have witnessed terrible things in the past; little chauffeurs
of Gauleiters have profited so much by these transactions
that they have now about half a million. You, gentlemen,
know it. Is that correct?” (<span class='it'>1816-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Specific measures to effect the “Arianization” of Jewish businesses
were then discussed. A representative of German insurance
companies was called in to assist in solving the difficulties
created by the fact that most of the Jewish stores and other property
destroyed in the rioting were in fact insured, in some cases
ultimately by foreign insurance companies. All present were
agreed that it would be unfortunate to pass a law which would
have the effect of allowing foreign insurance companies to escape
from liability, and that moreover, so far as the insurance companies
were concerned, they had made a bargain and should stand
by it. The defendant Goering then suggested a solution:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Goering: No. I don’t even dream of refunding the insurance
companies the money. The companies are liable. No,
the money belongs to the State. That’s quite clear. That
would indeed be a present for the insurance companies. You
make a wonderful Petidum there. You’ll fulfill your obligations,
you may count on that.” (<span class='it'>1816-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is impossible here to quote further from the extensive discussion
of all phases of persecution of the Jews which took place
at this meeting. It is sufficient to point out that on the same day
Goering, over his own signature, promulgated three decrees
putting into effect the most important matters decided at the
meeting. In the first of these decrees, a collective fine of 1,000,000,000
RM was placed on all German Jews (<span class='it'>1412-PS</span>). The
second decree, entitled “A Decree on Elimination of Jews from
German Economic Life”, barred Jews from trades and crafts
(<span class='it'>2875-PS</span>). The third decree took care of the insurance question
raised in the morning’s meeting, by providing that insurance
due to Jews for various losses sustained by them was to be collected
by the State.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For other examples, the energetic manner in which Goering
took part in driving the Jews from economic life at this period,
see: <span class='it'>069-PS</span>; <span class='it'>1208-PS</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the German armies moved into other countries, the anti-Jewish
laws were extended, often in a more stringent form, to the
<span class='pageno' title='450' id='Page_450'></span>
occupied territories. Many of the decrees were not signed by
Goering himself, but were issued on the basis of decrees signed
by Goering and introducing the Four-Year Plan in the occupied
territories. For example, reference is made to the:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>Order Concerning the Introduction of the Four-Year Plan
in the Eastern Territories, 30 October 1939. 1939 Reichsgesetzblatt,
Part I, p. 2125.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, in his capacity as Commissioner of the Four-Year
Plan, or as Chairman of the Ministerial Council for National
Defense, Goering himself signed several anti-Jewish decrees for
occupied territories, including the following:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>1939 Reichsgesetzblatt I, p. 1703, Verordnung ueber die Ammeldung
der Vermoegens von Juden in den sudetendeutschen
Gebieten, 2 December 1938 (Order concerning the registration
of the property of Jews in the Sudeten German territories),
which was the preliminary for sequestration of such
property,</p>

<p>1939 Reichsgesetzblatt I, p. 702, Verordnung ueber die Einfuehrung
der Luftschutzgesetzes in den sudetendeutschen
Gebieten, 31 March 1939 (Order concerning the introduction
of the Air Defense Law in the Sudeten German territories),
discriminating against Jews,</p>

<p>1940 Reichsgesetzblatt, I, p. 1270, Verordnung ueber die
Behandlung von Vermoegen der Angehoerigen des ehemaligen
polnischen Staates, 17 September 1940 (Order concerning
treatment of property of nationals of the former
Polish State), by which the property of Polish Jews was
confiscated,</p>

<p>1940 Reichsgesetzblatt I, p. 1547, Kriegsachschaeden Verordnung
(War Damages Law), 30 November 1940, also discriminating
against Jews, and</p>

<p>1941 Reichsgesetzblatt I, p. 759, Decree regarding Administration
of Criminal Law against Poles and Jews in the Incorporated
Eastern Territories, 4 December 1941, which introduced
especially stringent penal laws for Jews.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>During the later years of the war, the program of the Nazi
conspirators for the complete physical annihilation of all Jews in
Europe achieved its full fury. While the execution of this program
was for the most part handled by the SS and the Security
Police, Goering remains implicated in the final phases of the Nazi
“Solution” of the Jewish problem. On 31 July 1941, he wrote
the following letter to the conspirator Heydrich:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Complementing the task that was assigned to you on 24
January 1939, which dealt with arriving at—through furtherance
<span class='pageno' title='451' id='Page_451'></span>
of emigration and evacuation, a solution of the Jewish
problem, as advantageous as possible, I hereby charge you
with making all necessary preparations in regard to organizational
and financial matters for bringing about a complete
solution of the Jewish question in the German sphere of influence
in Europe.</p>

<p>“Wherever other governmental agencies are involved, these
are to cooperate with you.</p>

<p>“I charge you furthermore to send me, before long, an overall
plan concerning the organizational, factual and material
measures necessary for the accomplishment of the desired
solution of the Jewish question.” (<span class='it'>710-PS</span>)</p>

<h3>A. <span class='it'>POSITIONS HELD BY HESS.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Between 1919 and 1941, Hess held the following positions</span>:</p>

appointed 15 December 1932 (<span class='it'>3132-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>k</span>) <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> of the N.S.D.A.P. (Member of the Party Directorate)
(<span class='it'>3198-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>l</span>) Member of the Reichs Defense Council (<span class='it'>2261-PS</span>).</p>

<h3>B. <span class='it'>PROMOTION OF THE NAZI CONSPIRATORS’ ACCESSION TO POWER.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi Party was the conspiracy’s main instrument of control.
As its directing head, Hess used this instrument vigorously
to advance the purposes of the conspiracy. He thus played
a decisive part in the preparation and execution of its criminal
designs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hess began his conspiratorial activities immediately upon the
termination of World War I by joining militaristic and nationalistic
organizations. He became a member of the Thule Society
and of the Free Corps Epp. In June 1920 he joined the Nazi
Party, receiving membership card No. 16 (<span class='it'>3191-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3347-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>By 1923 Hess was an SA leader and head of the Nazi University
Organization in Munich. He took part in the Nazi Putsch of
8-9 November 1923. As a result he was tried and convicted on
a charge of high treason (<span class='it'>3132-PS</span>). He spent 7½ months of his
18 months’ sentence with Hitler at the Landsberg Fortress
<span class='pageno' title='467' id='Page_467'></span>
(<span class='it'>3191-PS</span>). There Hitler dictated <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> to him (<span class='it'>3132-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>After their release, Hess remained extremely close to Hitler.
In 1925, he became officially his private secretary and A. d. C.
(<span class='it'>3192-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the Party crisis which resulted from the sudden resignation
of Gregor Strasser, head of the Party’s Political Organization,
in December 1932, Hitler called on Hess to take charge of
the newly formed Central Political Committee of the Party, in
order to restore its strength and unity (<span class='it'>3132-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shortly thereafter, Hess took part in the decisive negotiations
which brought the Nazi conspirators into power on 30 January
1933 (<span class='it'>3132-PS</span>).</p>

<h3>C. <span class='it'>ESTABLISHMENT OF TOTALITARIAN CONTROL OVER GERMANY.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Upon the conspirators’ accession to power, Hess was appointed
Deputy to the Fuehrer of the NSDAP (<span class='it'>3196-PS</span>). His broad
powers and responsibilities in that position were officially described
as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“All the threads of the Party work are gathered together by
the Deputy of the Fuehrer. He gives the final word on all
intra-Party plans and all questions vital for the existence of
the German people. The Deputy of the Fuehrer gives the directives
required for all the Party work, in order to maintain
the unity, determination and striking power of the N.S.D.A.P.
as the bearer of the National-Socialist philosophy.” (<span class='it'>3163-PS</span>;
<span class='it'>Chart Number 15</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Through Hess the Conspirators established the control of the
Party over the State. As a first step he obtained a seat in the
Cabinet, which had in effect become the sole legislative organ of
the Reich (<span class='it'>2001-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2426-PS</span>; <span class='it'>1395-PS</span>). As a Cabinet Minister,
Hess signed the laws which further strengthened the political
power of the Nazi Party. Among these enactments were the law
of 1 August 1944 consolidating the positions of Chief of State and
Leader of the Party (<span class='it'>2003-PS</span>); and the law of 20 December 1934
against treacherous attacks on Party and State (<span class='it'>1393-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through a long series of decrees Hess obtained control over
every aspect of public and private life in Germany, in order to
subvert it to the aims of the conspiracy, as represented by the
Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Hess gained control over all legislation.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>A Hitler Decree of 27 July 1934 provided for Hess’s participation
in the drafting of all legislation (<span class='it'>D-138</span>). In a circular to
<span class='pageno' title='468' id='Page_468'></span>
Cabinet members on 9 October 1939, Hess stated that he would
in the future veto every bill which reached him too late to allow
him enough time for its thorough study from the Party point of
view (<span class='it'>D-139</span>). A letter from Chief of the Reich Chancellery
Lammers, on 12 April 1938, announced a supplementary decree
extending Hess’s participation, especially with regard to the
drafting of laws affecting individual States (<span class='it'>D-140</span>; see <span class='it'>1942-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Hess gained control over all government appointments, including
those of the judiciary and university teachers.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>A decree of 24 September 1935 provided for the consultation
of Hess in the appointment of Reich and State civil servants
(<span class='it'>3180-PS</span>). A decree of 10 July 1937 provided for the participation
of the Fuehrer’s Deputy in the appointment of Reich and
State civil servants (<span class='it'>3184-PS)</span>. A decree of 14 October 1936,
signed by Hess, regulated the status of Reich and State civil
servants (<span class='it'>3183-PS</span>). A further decree of 3 April 1936 provided
for Hess’s participation in the appointment of Labor Service officials
(<span class='it'>3182-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Hess gained control over Local Government Administration.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>This control was effected through the German Municipality Act
of 30 January 1935 provided for the participation of Party delegates
(<span class='it'>2008-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>Hess gained control over the administration of annexed
territories.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, the Ordinance of 10 June 1939 provided for Hess’s participation
in the administration of Austria (<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>
1939, Part I, p. 995) while another Ordinance of the same date
provided for Hess’s participation in the administration of the
Sudetenland (<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span> 1939, Part I, p. 997).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(5) <span class='it'>Hess, in his capacity as Deputy Leader of the Party,
gained control over the German Youth.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>An order of 10 July 1934 set up a University Commission of
the NSDAP under Hess; an Order of 18 July 1934 placed the
NS German Student League directly under Hess; and an Order
of 14 November 1934 delegated to the Student League exclusive
jurisdiction over the political and ideological education of German
students (<span class='it'>3132-PS</span>). A Hess Decree of 3 June 1936 established
the NS Aid Fund for the Struggle in the Universities (<span class='it'>3203-PS</span>;
see also <span class='it'>3132-PS</span> and <span class='it'>1392-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The success of this entire program of legislation was described
by Hitler as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In this Reich everybody who has a responsible position is a
National Socialist * * * Every institution of this Reich
<span class='pageno' title='469' id='Page_469'></span>
is under the orders of the supreme political leadership
* * * The Party leads the Reich (<span class='it'>2715-P</span>S; see <span class='it'>1774-PS</span>
and <span class='it'>3163-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In order to enable the conspirators to buttress their power
through the armed terror of the SA and SS, Hess, while not actually
in control of these Party formations, nevertheless gave
them active support. Thus, he was instrumental in establishing
the Hitler Grant (a large fund contributed annually by heavy
German industry under the chairmanship of Krupp) and in directing
part thereof to the support of the SA and SS (<span class='it'>D-151</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>When several SA men were convicted for mistreatment of inmates
of the Hohnstein concentration camp, two members of the
jury which had voted the conviction were expelled from the party
(<span class='it'>784-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, when Himmler, Reich Leader of the SS, organized the
SD, Hess issued an order establishing the SD as the sole political
information service of the Nazi Party, its functions to be exercised
through the SS (<span class='it'>3385-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hess also sought to destroy the influence of the independent
churches among the German people, in order to wipe out every
opposition to the aims of the conspirators. Thus, Hess’s Chief
of Staff, Bormann, issued numerous orders and communications
from Hess’s office against the independent churches. Among these
were the Secret Order of 27 July 1938 making clergymen ineligible
for party offices (<span class='it'>113-PS</span>); the Party Directive of 14 July 1939
making the clergy and theology students ineligible for Party
membership (<span class='it'>840-PS</span>); the letter of 22 February 1940 discussing
ways and means of eliminating religious instruction from the
schools (<span class='it'>098-PS</span>); the report of 25 April on the progressive
substitution of National Socialist mottoes in place of morning
prayers in the schools (<span class='it'>070-PS</span>); the letter to Rosenberg of 17
January 1940 concerning the undesirability of religious literature
for members of the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> (<span class='it'>101-PS</span>); the instructions
of 8 March 1940 against the further issuance of newsprint to
confessional newspapers (<span class='it'>089-PS</span>); and the letter to the Minister
of the Interior, in May 1938, agreeing to the invalidation of
the Concordat between Austria and the Holy See (<span class='it'>675-PS</span>; <span class='it'>838-PS</span>
and <span class='it'>107-PS</span>).</p>

<h3>D. <span class='it'>PREPARATION FOR WAR.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Hess was one of the members of the conspiracy who professed
as early as 1933 the aim of complete world domination (<span class='it'>2385-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In pursuance of that aim Hess threw the power of the Party
<span class='pageno' title='470' id='Page_470'></span>
which he directed, behind the war preparations of the conspiracy.
Hess himself described the Party, in this connection, as the mechanism
with which to “organize and direct offensively and defensively
the spiritual and political strength of the people” (<span class='it'>2426-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hess’s tasks in the preparations for aggressive wars fell mainly
into the fields of military preparedness, political planning, and
fifth-column activities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Rearmament.</span> Even before 1933 Hess took a personal interest
in the secret military training program of the uniformed
Party organizations (<span class='it'>1143-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the conspirators had come to power, Hess was one of
those who echoed the cry of “guns for butter” in his speeches
(<span class='it'>2426-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hess signed the law which reintroduced universal military conscription
in Germany on 16 March 1935 (<span class='it'>1654-PS</span>). Hess admitted
that signing this law was no mere formality for him, but
rather the realization of one of his most important aims, when
he declared in a speech to Army officers in 1937:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“When I spoke about conscription after the 16th of March
1935, in what used to be the most radical industrial plant of
Munich * * * to thousands and thousands of the same
workers who but a few years before had been singing the Internationale,
I was interrupted again and again by such applause
and cheers as I would never have believed possible.
That was the most beautiful and at the same time the most
moving demonstration of my life (<span class='it'>3124-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>When the Nazi conspirators were ready to launch their aggressive
wars in the fall of 1938, Hess and the Party agencies under
his control cooperated with the Army High Command in the
mobilization of the German Army (<span class='it'>388-PS, Item 32</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Political Planning for War.</span> When the Reich Defense
Council was reorganized in September 1938, Hess became one of
its members with the express assignment of assuring “the political
direction of the nation” (<span class='it'>2261-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hess was also made a member of the Ministers’ Council for the
Defense of the Reich upon its creation in 1939. Here he continued
to exercise an important war-planning function with the
specific task of “guaranteeing the unity between Party and State”
within that body (<span class='it'>2018-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2608-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hess’s functions in the field of political planning for war were
not limited to the domestic sphere. He was also a member of the
Secret Cabinet Council formed to advise Hitler on foreign policy
planning (<span class='it'>1377-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3189-PS</span>).
<span class='pageno' title='471' id='Page_471'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Fifth Column Activities.</span> Hess’ most important contribution
to the conspirators’ preparations for aggressive war lay in
his organization of the German fifth-columns abroad through the
Foreign Organization (<span class='it'>Auslands Organisation</span> (AO)) of the Nazi
Party and its various affiliated semi-official organizations.
Through these channels Hess succeeded in building up conspiratorial
shock-troops in foreign countries, composed of citizens of
these countries who were of German “racial stock.” These foreign
citizens were incited by Hess to acts of treason against their
country in furtherance of the plans of the conspiracy. It was
the subversive activities of these fifth-column groups which prepared
the way for the conspirators’ destruction of independence
of many countries. Principal among these were Austria, Czechoslovakia,
and Poland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As his chief instrument in this conspiratorial campaign Hess
created the Foreign Organization of the Nazi Party on 3 October
1933. This office was placed directly under Hess, who from then
on was known to take the greatest personal interest in its rapid
development and expansion (<span class='it'>3258-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3401-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3254-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Foreign Organization extended its activities not only to
German citizens living abroad but to all persons allegedly of German
ancestry regardless of their foreign citizenship. In the
early years after the conspirators’ rise to power and up to 1937
this aim was openly admitted by the responsible heads of the
Foreign Organization (<span class='it'>3258-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hess announced that it was the task of the Foreign Organization
to organize all persons of the German race who lived abroad
and to turn them into active Nazi supporters, thus making them
subservient to the purposes of the conspiracy. In his speech at
the 1937 Congress of the Foreign Organization, Hess declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“You stand before me as a slice of the great German racial
community, the racial community which extends beyond the
borders of our Reich, for National Socialism has not only at
home created a national community transcending all classes
and groups in a way previously unknown, but it has also
included German racial comrades [<span class='it'>Volks-Genossen</span>] in foreign
countries. It has made them conscious and proud members
of this racial community! * * *</p>

<p>“Under the leadership of the Foreign Organization, Germandom
abroad is also becoming more and more <span class='it'>filled with the
National Socialist spirit</span>. The Foreign Organization, of the
NSDAP has brought together the Germans out there, who
even long after the seizure of power were disunited and split
<span class='pageno' title='472' id='Page_472'></span>
by class differences, and joined them with Adolf Hitler’s
Reich. The National Socialist care for Germandom abroad
is maintaining an enormous number of Germans for the nation,
who otherwise would be absorbed as cultural fertilizer
for other nations” (<span class='it'>3258-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The same principle was expressed bluntly by Gauleiter Ernst
Bohle, head of the Foreign Organization of the NSDAP directly
under Hess from 1933 to 1945, who stated in his address at the
Nurnberg Party Congress of 1936:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Fuehrer had to come in order to hammer into all of us
the fact that the German cannot choose and may not choose
whether or not he will be German but that he was sent into
this world by God as a German, that God thereby had laid
upon him as a German duties of which he cannot divest himself
without committing treason to Providence. <span class='it'>Therefore
we believe and we know that the German everywhere</span> is a
<span class='it'>German</span>—whether he lives in the Reich or in Japan, in
France or in China or anywhere else in the world. <span class='it'>Not countries
or continents, not climate or environments but blood and
race determine the world of ideas of the German.</span>” (<span class='it'>3258-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Hess was also in control of all other semi-official organizations
associated with the Foreign Organization in fifth-column work
among foreign citizens of German ancestry, for the purpose of
gaining foreign support for the conspiracy. Thus, by a Secret
Circular of 3 February 1939, Hess ordered the consolidation of
the undercover activities of all organizations active in the foreign
field, subject to the central direction of SS Gruppenfuehrer Werner
Lorenz, head of the <span class='it'>Volks-deutsche Mittelstelle</span> (Central
Agency for Racial Germans) (<span class='it'>837-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two most important of these semi-official agencies were
the VDA (League for Germandom Abroad) and the DAI (German
Foreign Institute). The VDA was a vast world-wide organization
giving financial support to various activities of German
groups abroad without regard to their nationality. Its large
funds were collected in Germany with the aid of the Nazi Government
(<span class='it'>3258-PS</span>). The aim of the activities of the VDA was to
establish a great German world empire of 100,000,000 inhabitants,
containing all persons of German “racial stock” everywhere,
including millions of American citizens (<span class='it'>3258-PS</span>). The
DAI was a world-wide information intelligence and propaganda
service (<span class='it'>3258-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hess repeatedly stressed the importance of using Germans
abroad for spreading Nazi propaganda (<span class='it'>3124-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The DAI also based its activities on the proposition that all
<span class='pageno' title='473' id='Page_473'></span>
persons of German ancestry belonged to the Nazi German Reich,
though they held citizenship in foreign countries. This was stated
by Nazi Minister-President Mergenthaler of Wuerttemberg in
his address at the 1933 annual meeting of the DAI:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The liberalist ideology which has been overcome dealt with
the formal concept of the citizen. We have gotten rid of that.
Today the blood-united German racial comrade stands in the
center. That is the new foundation upon which we must
build * * *. Hence I want to impress on the DAI: Join us
therefore in taking care that the spirit of National Socialism
also becomes alive among the German racial comrades in
foreign countries so that streams of energy may emanate
from it.” (<span class='it'>3258-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At the annual meeting held by the DAI in 1937, Frick restated
in his address the fundamental aim of this organization: to unite
every person of German “racial stock” under the control of the
Nazi conspirators.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * the new Germany has recognized that its attention
and devotion to the welfare of the millions of Germans who
have not the fortune to owe political allegiance to Germany,
but who are condemned to live abroad, are not merely a matter
of natural sympathy and solidarity but are in a higher
degree dictated by the strong political and economic interests
of the Reich.” (<span class='it'>3258-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is noteworthy that the DAI was closely affiliated with the
German-American Bund, a subversive Nazi organization in the
United States. The DAI’s official periodical, “Germandom
Abroad” (<span class='it'>Deutschtum im Ausland</span>), was edited during the war
by Walter Kappe, former press chief of the Bund (<span class='it'>3258-PS</span>).
Walter Kappe and Fritz Gissibl, another former leader in the
Bund, established on the premises of the DAI in Stuttgart an
organization called “Comradeship U. S. A.” The purpose of this
“Comradeship U. S. A.” was to maintain during the war an organization
for all Nazi Party members who had been active in
the Bund in the United States (<span class='it'>3258-PS</span>). Even before the outbreak
of the war, in the spring of 1939, Walter Kappe had undertaken
to collect a complete archive of Nazi activities in the U. S.
on behalf of the DAI and the Nazi Party (<span class='it'>3258-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The success of this world-wide fifth column directed by Hess
is now a matter of historical record. Hess himself guided the
subversive foreign groups which he had created until the
day when the conspirators were ready to annex the countries
which they had undermined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, the annexation of Austria was principally due to the
<span class='pageno' title='474' id='Page_474'></span>
efforts of the Nazi Party’s work within that country under the
orders of Hess. As early as 1934 Hess had appointed Reinthaler
leader of the Nazi peasants in Austria, and thus placed him in a
position to take over the leadership of the Nazi Fifth Column in
Austria (<span class='it'>812-PS</span>). Hess took a major part in the negotiations
carried on by Seyss-Inquart and other members of the conspiracy
in preparation of the Anschluss (<span class='it'>3254-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3425-PS</span>). When on
12 March 1938 Germany invaded Austria, Hess, accompanied by
Himmler, was the first member of the conspiracy to arrive in
Vienna at noon on the same day (<span class='it'>L-292</span>). The next day Hess
signed the decree by which the conspirators destroyed the independence
of Austria (<span class='it'>2307-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3075-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once the conspirators had achieved their aim, Hess did not
hesitate to admit publicly that he had approved of the steps
which led to the final subjection of Austria. On 24 July 1938 he
addressed a meeting held on the fourth anniversary of the assassination
of Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss by members of the
89th SS Regiment. He devoted the larger part of his speech to a
justification of that assassination (<span class='it'>L-273</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the conspirators turned their attention to their next victim,
Czechoslovakia, Hess was again in the forefront directing
the German fifth-column in the Sudetenland. In his speech at the
annual meeting of the Foreign Organization of the NSDAP on
28 August 1938, Hess declared that Nazi Germany was giving
full backing to the demands of the Sudeten German agitators.
What such support meant in fact became very clear when Hess
pointed to the success of the Nazi policy in Austria (<span class='it'>3258-PS</span>).
All through the summer of 1938 Hess was engaged in consultations
with Karl H. Frank and Konrad Henlein, leaders of the
Nazi Sudeten German Party (<span class='it'>3061-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few months later Hess could mark up another success for his
fifth-column. When the Munich Agreement forced Czechoslovakia
to surrender the Sudeten territory to Germany, Hess went to
Reichenberg, the capital of that district, as Hitler’s representative
in order to accept the official incorporation of the Sudeten
German Party into the Nazi Party on 5 November 1938. In his
address on that occasion he emphasized repeatedly that the Nazi
conspirators had been ready to go to war for the possession of
the Sudetenland (<span class='it'>3204-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hess also put his signature to the Act of 14 April 1939 setting
up the government of the Sudetenland as an integral part of
the Reich (<span class='it'>3076-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later during the same year, after the conspirators had loosed
their first aggressive war, Hess signed the laws incorporating first
<span class='pageno' title='475' id='Page_475'></span>
Danzig and then a large portion of Poland into the Reich
(<span class='it'>3077-PS</span>; see also Decree 8 October 1939 (RGBl 1939, Part I,
p. 2042); Decree of 12 October 1939, Part I, p. 2077).</p>

<p class='pindent'>When in July 1941 the Nazi conspirators occupied Greece, the
members of the local Nazi Party were ready to take over as an
auxiliary Army service (<span class='it'>3258-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, wherever the conspirators sent their invading armies
Hess’ fifth-column had prepared the soil.</p>

<h3>E. <span class='it'>PARTICIPATION IN THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT WAR CRIMES AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Hess, as Deputy Leader of the Nazi Party, had the task of realizing
its “ideological” program (<span class='it'>3200-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the demands of this conspiratorial program was the destruction
of so-called inferior racial stock. Persons who suffered
from hereditary insanity or other hereditary diseases were considered
useless to the Nazi community. They were therefore to
be killed or at least to be prevented from procreating their kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In order to carry out this plan Hess established a special Racial
Policy Division on his Staff under Dr. Walter Gross, by his order
of 17 November 1933. This Division was to “participate with the
competent government agencies in all race and population measures”
(<span class='it'>3322-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3163-PS</span>). In addition, other agencies of the
Nazi Party, under Hess, actively cooperated in the administration
of this criminal program (<span class='it'>D-181</span>; <span class='it'>842-PS</span>; <span class='it'>1969-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1937 Hess publicly claimed credit for having used his Party
organization in order to gain the nation’s approval for compulsory
sterilization (<span class='it'>3124-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3067-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>More important still in the Nazi program were the persecution
and extermination of religious and racial minorities. Hess vigorously
propagated the doctrine of the superiority of the German
race with which the conspirators sought to justify these persecutions
(<span class='it'>3124-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nurnberg Laws, which constituted the legal basis of this
campaign, were the work of the Party. This was solemnly announced
by Hitler in the peroration of the address in which he
announced these laws to the Reichstag in Nurnberg 15 September
1935:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I now propose to the Reichstag the acceptance of those laws
which Party member Goering will read to you.</p>

<p>“The first and second laws fulfill the program of the National
Socialist Party in one important respect, and thereby pay a
<span class='pageno' title='476' id='Page_476'></span>
debt of gratitude to the Movement under whose symbol Germany
has regained her freedom.</p>

<p>“The second law constitutes an attempt to solve by legislation
a problem, the final solution of which, if it should again fail,
will then have to be referred by law to the National Socialist
Party. All three laws are backed by the National Socialist
Party and with it and behind it by the German Nation.</p>

<p>“I ask you to accept these laws.” (<span class='it'>3419-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Hess, along with Frick, was placed in charge of the administration
of the Nurnberg Laws and of the issuance of ordnances
and regulations thereunder (<span class='it'>1416-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3179-PS</span>; <span class='it'>1417-PS</span>;
<span class='it'>2124-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the launching of their aggressive wars, the Nazi conspirators
embarked on the execution of their plan to exterminate
the non-German populations which fell into their hands. This
plan, especially insofar as it concerned the Jews, had been bluntly
revealed by Hitler well in advance in his address to the Reichstag
on 30 January 1939:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“If inter-national finance-Jewry inside and outside Europe
should succeed in throwing the nations into another <span class='it'>World
War</span>, the result will not be the Bolshevization of the earth and
thus the victory of Jewry, but the <span class='it'>destruction of the Jewish
race in Europe</span>!” (<span class='it'>3418-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In support of this campaign, which was continued by his co-conspirators
after his flight to Scotland, Hess issued an order
through his Party Chancery on behalf of the SS, which had been
put in charge of the extermination program. In this order, Hess
demanded the support of all Party members for the recruiting
drive of the SS Army Corps (Waffen SS). Hess added that these
SS formations were scheduled for service in the Eastern occupied
areas, where their “special training in race matters” could be
used to best advantage (<span class='it'>3245-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>By a series of further legislative and administrative measures,
Hess participated in the establishment of a special regime in
Poland which deprived the inhabitants of that country of their
legal protection, and thus initiated their wholesale extermination
(<span class='it'>R-139</span>; <span class='it'>R-96</span>; <span class='it'>R-141</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In pursuance of the same policy Hess signed the decree which
forced certain groups of Polish citizens to surrender their original
national allegiance and to accept German citizenship (Decree
of 24 October 1939, RGBl 1939, Part I, p. 2077).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hess also signed the decree establishing the German Racial
Register, under which Allied nationals of German stock were
<span class='pageno' title='477' id='Page_477'></span>
registered and then compelled to accept German nationality and
to remove to German territory (<span class='it'>2917-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hess also used Party channels in order to incite the German
people to violations of the rules of war. Thus, he ordered that
the population be instructed to seize Allied parachutists or to
“liquidate them” (<span class='it'>062-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hess also issued instructions to enforce Hitler’s orders prohibiting
the reconstruction of the city of Warsaw or of any of
Poland’s destroyed industries (<span class='it'>EC-411</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 10 May 1941, Hess flew to Scotland for the purpose of seeking
an end to the war with England, and support for Germany’s
demands against Russia. Upon his arrival, he was incarcerated
and thus forcibly eliminated from further participation in the
crimes of the conspiracy (<span class='it'>D-614</span>).</p>

<h3>F. <span class='it'>CONCLUSION.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Of all the members of the Nazi conspiracy, Hess was closest
to Hitler from the first. As Hitler’s secretary and A. d. C., as
his Deputy, and finally as his Second Successor Designate, Hess
was at all times his direct representative in all Party matters.
Thus, the conspiracy’s most powerful instrument of political
action rested in his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hess used this power to penetrate and dominate the German
government administration with National Socialist functionaries;
to control legislation and education; and to persecute all independent
groups, especially the churches and the Jews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Being responsible for the political direction and control of the
German people, through the Party, Hess played a decisive role
in preparing the nation for war. He furthered the secret rearmament
of the Party’s military formations; he signed the Conscription
Law of 1935; he sat on the Reichs Defense Council, the
inner Cabinet in which the heads of the conspiracy blue-printed
the administrative, economic, and political preparation of their
aggressive wars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hess, above, all, was responsible for the creation and direction
of the Nazi fifth-column, in which foreign citizens of German
extraction joined under the Nazi banner to weaken and undermine
those countries which the Nazi conspirators had determined
to subjugate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All through the years from 1920 to 1941 Hess remained the
most faithful and relentless executor of Hitler’s aims and designs.
This complete devotion to the success of the conspiracy was climaxed
by his flight to Scotland in an attempt to end the war with
<span class='pageno' title='478' id='Page_478'></span>
England and to receive English support for Germany’s demands
against Russia, which he had helped to prepare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The share of Hess’ participation in the Nazi conspiracy is as
great as that of the Party which he directed. The Party’s crimes
are his.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg489a'>3. JOACHIM VON RIBBENTROP</h2>

<h3>A. <span class='it'>POSITIONS HELD BY RIBBENTROP.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>According to Ribbentrop’s own certified statement (<span class='it'>2829-PS</span>),
he became a member of the Nazi Party in 1932, but according to
the semi-official statement in “<span class='it'>Das Archiv</span>,” he had gone to work
for the Party before that time by extending his business connections
to political circles. Having joined the service of the
Party in 1930 at the time of the final struggle for power in the
Reich, “Ribbentrop played an important if not strikingly obvious
part in the bringing about of the decisive meetings between the
representatives of the President of the Reich and the heads of the
<span class='pageno' title='490' id='Page_490'></span>
NSDAP, who had prepared the entry of Nazis into power on
30-1-1933. Those meetings as well as those between Hitler and
von Papen took place in Ribbentrop’s house in Berlin Dahlen.”
(<span class='it'>D-472</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ribbentrop was therefore present and active at the inception
of the Nazi seizure of power. In that first period he was advisor
to the Party on questions of foreign affairs. His title was first,
“Collaborator to the Fuehrer on matters of Foreign Policy.” He
later became Representative in Matters of Foreign Policy on the
Staff of the Deputy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was followed by membership in the Nazi Reichstag in
November 1933.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 24 April 1934 after Germany had left the disarmament conference,
he was appointed Delegate of the Reich Government in
matters of Disarmament. In this capacity he visited London and
other foreign capitals. He was then given a more important and
imposing title, the German Minister Plenipotentiary at Large,
and it was in that capacity that he negotiated the Anglo-German
Naval Agreement of 1935.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In March 1936, after the Nazi Government had reoccupied the
Rhineland zone, which had been demilitarized in accordance with
the terms of the Versailles and Locarno Treaties, and the matter
was brought before the Council of the League of Nations, Ribbentrop
addressed the Council in defense of Germany’s action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 11 August 1936 he was appointed Ambassador in London,
and occupied that position for a period of some eighteen months.
His activities while holding that position are not highly relevant
to the issues, but during that period, in his capacity which he
still had as German Minister Plenipotentiary at Large, he signed
the original Anticomintern Pact with Japan in November 1936,
and also the additional pact by which Italy joined it in 1937.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, on 24 February 1938, Ribbentrop was appointed Foreign
Minister in place of von Neurath, and simultaneously was
made a member of the Secret Cabinet Council (<span class='it'>Geheimer Kabinettsrat</span>)
established by decree of Hitler of the same date
(<span class='it'>1337-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ribbentrop became an <span class='it'>Oberfuehrer</span> in the SS, was subsequently
promoted to SS <span class='it'>Gruppenfuehrer</span> in 1938, and later became <span class='it'>Obergruppenfuehrer</span>.
There is no question of any honorary rank. The
SS went into his ancestry in detail in order to deal with the law
relating to that subject. Ribbentrop was also permitted to adopt
“von” as a prefix before his last name (<span class='it'>D-636</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>These activities of Ribbentrop in the earlier part of his career
<span class='pageno' title='491' id='Page_491'></span>
show in themselves that he assisted willing and deliberately in
bringing the Nazis into power, and in the earlier stage of their
obtaining control of the German State.</p>

<h3>B. <span class='it'>RIBBENTROP’S PART IN THE CONSPIRACY TO LAUNCH AND WAGE WARS OF AGGRESSION.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>The Austrian Anschluss.</span> Ribbentrop was present at a
meeting at Berchtesgaden on 12 February 1938, at which Hitler
and von Papen met the Austrian Chancellor von Schuschnigg
and his foreign minister, Guido Schmidt. The official German
account of that interview is contained in <span class='it'>2461-PS</span>. What appears
to be the truthful account of that interview is contained
in Jodl’s diary, the entries for 11 and 12 February 1938
(<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='noindent'>On 11 February Jodl wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the evening, and on 12 February, General Keitel with
General von Reichenau and Sperrle at Obersalzburg.
Schuschnigg, together with R. G. Schmidt, are again being
put under the heaviest political and military pressure. At
2300 hours Schuschnigg signs protocol.” (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The 13 February entry reads:</p>

<p>“In the afternoon, General Keitel asks Admiral Canaris
and myself to come to his apartment. He tells us that the
Fuehrer’s order is to the effect that military pressure by
shamming military action should be kept up until the 15th.
Proposals for these deceptive maneuvers are drafted and
submitted to the Fuehrer by telephone for approval.</p>

<p>“14 February:</p>

<p>“At 2:40 o’clock the agreement of the Fuehrer arrived.
Canaris went to Munich to the Counter-Intelligence Office
VII and initiates the different measures.</p>

<p>“The effect is quick and strong. In Austria the impression
is created that Germany is undertaking serious military
preparations.” (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The next step was the telephone conversation which took place
between Goering and Ribbentrop on 13 March 1938, when Ribbentrop
was still in London. Goering was passing on the false
statement that there was no ultimatum to Austria. The facts
of the ultimatum were explained by the earlier telephone conversations
between Goering and Vienna. But Goering then
passed the falsehood on to Ribbentrop in London in order that
he might placate and reassure political circles in London
(<span class='it'>2949-PS</span>).
<span class='pageno' title='492' id='Page_492'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The third step was taken by Ribbentrop after his return from
London. Although he had been appointed Foreign Minister in
February, he had gone back to London to clear up his business
at the embassy. Although he was still in London until after the
Anschluss had actually occurred, his name appears as a signatory
of the law making Austria a province of the German Reich
(<span class='it'>2307-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Czechoslovakia.</span> Czechoslovakia furnishes a typical example
of aggression in its various aspects. To summarize the
outstanding features briefly: First, there was the necessity of
stirring up trouble inside the country against which aggression
was planned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ribbentrop, as Foreign Minister, helped in the stirring up of
the Sudeten Germans under Henlein, who was in frequent contact
with the German Foreign Office (<span class='it'>3060-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2789-PS</span>;
<span class='it'>3059-PS</span>). These documents demonstrate how the Foreign Office
stirred up the Sudeten-German movement so that it would
act in accordance with the Government of the Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later on, Ribbentrop was present on 28 May 1938 at the conference
at which Hitler gave instructions to prepare the attack
on Czechoslovakia (<span class='it'>388-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2360-PS</span>). In a speech in January
1939 Hitler proclaimed that aggression was to take place
against Czechoslovakia (<span class='it'>2360-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“On the basis of this unbearable provocation, which was
still further emphasized by a truly infamous persecution
and terrorizing of our Germans there, I have now decided
to solve the Sudeten-German question in a final and radical
manner.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“On 28 May I gave the order for the preparation of military
steps against this state, to be concluded by 2 October.”
(<span class='it'>2360-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The important point is that 28 May was the date when the <span class='it'>Fall
Gruen</span> for Czechoslovakia was the subject of orders, and that it
was thereafter put into effect, to come to fruition at the beginning
of October.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was the second stage: To lay well in advance the plans of
aggression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third stage was to see that neighboring states were not
likely to cause trouble. Hence, on 18 July 1938, Ribbentrop had
a conversation with the Italian Ambassador, Attolico, at which
the attack on Czechoslovakia was discussed (<span class='it'>2800-PS</span>). Further
discussions along the same lines followed (<span class='it'>2791-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2792-PS</span>).
<span class='pageno' title='493' id='Page_493'></span>
The effect of these documents is, that it was made clear to the
Italian Government that the German Government was going to
move against Czechoslovakia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other interested country was Hungary, for Hungary had
certain territorial desires with regard to parts of the Czechoslovakian
Republic. Accordingly on 23 and 25 August Ribbentrop
was present at the discussions and had discussions himself with
the Hungarian politicians Imredi and Kanya (<span class='it'>2796-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2797-PS</span>).
These documents indicate that Ribbentrop endeavored to
get assurances of Hungarian help, and that the Hungarian Government
at the time was not too ready to commit itself to action,
although it was ready enough with sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Contacts had been established with the Sudeten Germans, for
theirs was the long-term grievance that had to be exploited. But
the next stage was to have a short-term grievance and to stir up
trouble, preferably at the fountainhead. Therefore, between 16
and 24 September, the German Foreign Office, of which Ribbentrop
was the head, was engaged in stirring up trouble in Prague
(<span class='it'>2858-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2855-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2854-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2853-PS</span>; and <span class='it'>2856-PS</span>). An example
of the type of these activities is the communication of 19
September from the Foreign Office to the German Embassy in
Prague (<span class='it'>2858-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Please inform Deputy Kundt at Konrad Henlein’s request,
to get in touch with the Slovaks at once and induce them to
start <span class='it'>their</span> demands <span class='it'>for</span> autonomy tomorrow.” (<span class='it'>2858-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Another of these documents deals with questions of arrest and
the action to be taken against any Czechs in Germany in order
to make the position more difficult (<span class='it'>2855-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was the contribution which Ribbentrop made to the pre-Munich
crisis, which culminated in the Munich agreement of
29 September 1938 (<span class='it'>TC-23</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>A significant aspect of Nazi plotting with regard to Czechoslovakia,
which shows the sort of action and advice which the
<span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> expected from the Foreign Office, is contained in a
long document putting forward an almost infinite variety of
breaches of International Law, which were likely to arise or
might have arisen from the action in regard to Czechoslovakia
(<span class='it'>C-2</span>). On all these points the opinion of the Foreign Office was
sought, with a view to explanation and justification. That, of
course, remained a hypothetical question because at that time
no war resulted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second stage of the acquisition of Czechoslovakia occurred
when, having obtained the Sudetenland, the Nazis arranged a
crisis in Czechoslovakia which would be an excuse for taking the
<span class='pageno' title='494' id='Page_494'></span>
rest. This action is important as constituting the first time that
the German Government disregarded its own commitment that
its desires did not go beyond the return of German blood to the
Reich. On that point, again, Ribbentrop was active. On 13 March,
as events were moving to a climax, he sent a telegram to the German
Minister in Prague, his subordinate, telling him to</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“make a point of not being available if the Czech Government
wants to get in touch with you in the next few days.”
(<span class='it'>2815-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At the same time Ribbentrop attended a conference in Berlin
with Hitler and a delegation of pro-Nazi Slovaks. Tiso, one of
the heads of the pro-Nazi Slovaks, was directed to declare an independent
Slovak State in order to assist in the disintegration of
Czechoslovakia (<span class='it'>2802-PS</span>). A previous meeting along the same
lines had been held a month before (<span class='it'>2790-PS</span>). Thus, Ribbentrop
was assisting in the task, again, of fomenting internal trouble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 14 March 1939, the following day, Hacha, the President of
Czechoslovakia, was called to Berlin. Ribbentrop was at this meeting,
at which pressure and threats were used to obtain the aged
President’s consent to hand over the Czechoslovak State to Hitler
(<span class='it'>2798-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3061-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was the end of the Czech part of Czechoslovakia. The
following week Ribbentrop signed a treaty with Slovakia, Article
II of which granted the German Government the right to construct
military posts and installations, and to keep them garrisoned
within Slovakia (<span class='it'>1439-PS</span>). Thus, after swallowing
Bohemia and Moravia as an independent state, Ribbentrop obtained
military control over Slovakia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Lithuania.</span> An interesting point concerning the Northern
Baltic shows how difficult it was for Ribbentrop to keep his hands
out of the internal affairs of other countries, even when it did
not seem a very important matter. On 3 April 1939 Germany
had occupied the Memeland (<span class='it'>TC-53-A</span>). It would have appeared,
as far as the Baltic States were concerned, that the position was
satisfactory to the Nazis but in fact Ribbentrop was acting in
close concert with Heydrich, in stirring up trouble in Lithuania
with a group of pro-Nazi people called the Woldemaras Supporters
(<span class='it'>2953-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2952-PS</span>). Heydrich was passing to Ribbentrop
a request for financial support for this group:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Dear Party Comrade v. Ribbentrop,</p>

<p>“Enclosed please find a further report about the ‘Woldemaras
Supporters.’ As already mentioned in the previous
report, the ‘<span class='it'>Woldemaras Supporters’ are still asking for help
<span class='pageno' title='495' id='Page_495'></span>
from the Reich.</span> I therefore ask you to examine the question
of financial support, brought up again by the ‘Woldemaras
Supporters’ set forth on page 4, para 2 of the enclosed report
and to make a definite decision.</p>

<p>“<span class='it'>The request of the ‘Woldemaras Supporters’ for financial
support could, in my opinion, be granted. Deliveries of arms
should not, however, be made, under any circumstances.</span>”
(<span class='it'>2953-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>At the end of a fuller report on the same matter (2952-PS) there
is added in handwriting,</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I support small regular payments, e.g. 2,000 to 3,000 marks
quarterly.” (<span class='it'>2952-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>It is signed “W”, who was the Secretary of State. Such was the
extraordinary interference, even with comparatively unimportant
countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>Poland.</span> In the aggression against Poland, there were several
periods. The first was what might be called the Munich period,
up to the end of September 1938, and at that time no
language the Nazis could use was too good for Poland. Examples
of German assurances and reassurances to Poland during this
period are Hitler’s Reichstag speech on 20 February 1938
(<span class='it'>2357-PS</span>), the secret Foreign Office memorandum of 26 August
1938 (<span class='it'>TC-76</span>), and the conversation between M. Lipski, the Polish
ambassador, and Ribbentrop (<span class='it'>TC-73, No. 40</span>). A final illustration
of this technique is Hitler’s speech at the Sportzpalast on 26
September 1938, in which he said that this was the end of his
territorial problems in Europe and expressed an almost violent
affection for the Poles (<span class='it'>TC-73, No. 42</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next stage occupied the period between Munich and the
rape of Prague. With part of the German plan for Czechoslovakia
having been accomplished and parts still remaining to be
done, there was a slight change towards Poland but still a friendly
atmosphere. In a conversation with M. Lipski, the Polish Ambassador
to Berlin, on 24 October 1938, Ribbentrop put forward
very peaceful suggestions for the settlement of the Danzig issue
(<span class='it'>TC-73, No. 44</span>). The Polish reply, of 31 October 1938, stated
that it was unacceptable that Danzig should return to the Reich,
but made suggestions of a bilateral agreement (<span class='it'>TC-73, No. 45</span>).
Between these dates the German Government had made its preparations
to occupy Danzig by surprise (<span class='it'>C-137</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>But although these preparations were made, still some two
months later, on 5 January 1939, Hitler was suggesting to M.
<span class='pageno' title='496' id='Page_496'></span>
Beck, the Polish Foreign Minister, a new solution (<span class='it'>TC-73, No.
48</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ribbentrop saw M. Beck on the next day and said that there
was to be no violent solution of the Danzig issue, but a further
building up of friendly relations (<span class='it'>TC-73, No. 49</span>). Not content
with that, Ribbentrop went to Warsaw on 25 January to talk of
the continued progress and consolidation of friendly relations
(<span class='it'>2530-PS</span>). That was capped by Hitler’s Reichstag speech on
30 January 1939, in the same tone (<span class='it'>TC-73, No. 57</span>). That was
the second stage—the mention of Danzig in honeyed words, because
the rape of Prague had not yet been attained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, in the meeting at the Reichschancellery on 23 May 1939,
Hitler made it quite clear, and so stated, that Danzig had nothing
to do with the real Polish question (<span class='it'>L-79</span>). “I have to deal with
Poland because I want <span class='it'>lebensraum</span> in the East”—that is the effect
of Hitler’s words at that time: that Danzig was merely an excuse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The extent to which Ribbentrop had adopted this attitude of
mind of Hitler at this time is shown in the introduction to Count
Ciano’s Diary (<span class='it'>2987-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the Summer of 1939 Germany advanced her claim against
Poland, naturally without our knowledge; indeed, Ribbentrop
had several times denied to our Ambassador that Germany
had any intentions of carrying the controversy to extremes.
Despite these denials I remained in doubt; I wanted to make
sure for myself, and on August 11th I went to Salzburg. It
was in his residence at Fuschl that Ribbentrop informed me,
while we were waiting to sit down at the table, of the decision
to start the fireworks, just as he might have told me about
the most unimportant and commonplace administrative matter.
‘Well, Ribbentrop,’ I asked him, while we were walking
in the garden, ‘What do you want? The Corridor, or Danzig?’
‘Not any more’, and he stared at me through those cold Musee
Grevin eyes, ‘We want war.’ ” (<span class='it'>2987-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>That extraordinary declaration closely corroborates Hitler’s
statement at his Chancellery conference on 23 May—that it was
no longer a question of Danzig or the Corridor, but a question of
war to achieve <span class='it'>lebensraum</span> in the East (<span class='it'>L-79</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>It should be recalled in this connection that “<span class='it'>Fall Weiss</span>”, the
plan for operations against Poland, is dated 3 and 11 April 1939,
thus showing that preparations were already in hand (<span class='it'>C-120</span>).
Another entry in Count Ciano’s Diary during the summer of 1939
makes this point quite clear:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I have collected in the conference records verbal transcripts
<span class='pageno' title='497' id='Page_497'></span>
of my conversations with Ribbentrop and Hitler. I shall only
note some impressions of a general nature. Ribbentrop is
evasive every time I ask him for particulars of the forthcoming
German action. He has a guilty conscience. He has lied
too many times about German intentions toward Poland not
to feel embarrassment now over what he must tell me and
what he is preparing to do.</p>

<p>“The will to fight is unalterable. He rejects any solution
which might satisfy Germany and prevent the struggle. I
am certain that even if the Germans were given everything
they demanded, they would attack just the same, because
they are possessed by the demon of destruction.</p>

<p>“Our conversation sometimes takes a dramatic turn. I do
not hesitate to speak my mind in the most brutal manner.
But this doesn’t shake him in the least. I realize how little
weight this view carries in German opinion.</p>

<p>“The atmosphere is icy. And the cold feeling between us is
reflected in our followers. During dinner we do not exchange
a word. We distrust each other. But I at least have a clear
conscience. He has not.” (<span class='it'>2987-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The next stage in the German plan consisted of sharp pressure
over the claim for Danzig, commencing immediately after
Czechoslovakia had been formally dealt with on 15 March 1939.
The first sharp raising of the claim was on 21 March (<span class='it'>TC-73,
No. 61</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>An interesting sidelight during the last days before the war
concerns the return of Herr von Dirksen, the German Ambassador
at the Court of St. James, to Berlin on 18 August 1939. When
interrogated (after capture) regarding the significance of this
event, Ribbentrop expressed a complete absence of recollection
of ever having seen the German Ambassador to England after
his return. Ribbentrop thought he would have remembered him
if he had seen him, and therefore he accepted the probability that
he did not see him (<span class='it'>D-490</span>). Thus when it was well known that
war with Poland would involve England and France, either Ribbentrop
was not sufficiently interested in opinion in London to
take the trouble to see his ambassador, or else, as he rather suggests,
he had appointed so weak and ordinary a career diplomat to
London that his opinion was not taken into account, either by
himself or by Hitler. In either case, Ribbentrop was completely
uninterested in anything which his Ambassador might have to tell
him as to opinion in London or the possibility of war. It is putting
the matter with great moderation to say that in the last days
<span class='pageno' title='498' id='Page_498'></span>
before 1 September 1939, Ribbentrop did whatever he could to
avoid peace with Poland and to avoid anything which might hinder
the encouraging of the war which he and the Nazis wanted. He
did that, well knowing that war with Poland would involve Great
Britain and France. (See also Section 8 of Chapter IX on Aggression
Against Poland.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. Lipski, the Polish Ambassador at Berlin, summarized all
these events leading up to the war in his report of 10 October 1939
(<span class='it'>TC-73, No. 147</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(5) <span class='it'>Norway and Denmark.</span> On 31 May 1939, Ribbentrop, on
behalf of Germany, signed a non-aggression pact with Denmark
which provided that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The German Reich and the Kingdom of Denmark will under
no circumstances go to war or employ force of any other kind
against one another.” (<span class='it'>TC-24</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And on 7 April 1940 the German armed forces invaded Denmark
at the same time they invaded Norway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ribbentrop was fully involved in the earlier preparations for the
aggression against Norway. Along with Rosenberg, Ribbentrop
assisted Quisling in his early activities. A letter from Rosenberg
to Ribbentrop on 24 February states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Dear Party Comrade von Ribbentrop:</p>

<p>“Party Comrade Scheidt has returned and has made a detailed
report to Privy Councillor von Gruendherr who will
address you on this subject. We agreed the other day that
2-300,000 RM would be made immediately available for the
said purpose. Now it turns out that Privy Councillor Gruendherr
states that the second instalment can be made available
only after eight days. But as it is necessary for Scheidt to
go back immediately, I request you to make it possible that
this second instalment is given to him at once. With a longer
absence of <span class='it'>Reichsamtsleiter</span> P. M. Scheidt also the connection
with your representatives would be broken up, which just
now, under certain circumstances, could be very unfavorable.</p>

<p>“Therefore I trust that it is in everybody’s interest, if P. M.
Scheidt goes back immediately.” (<span class='it'>957-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In a report to Hitler on the Quisling activities, Rosenberg outlined
Ribbentrop’s part in the preparation of the Norwegian
operation:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * Apart from financial support which was forthcoming
from the Reich in currency, Quisling had also been promised
a shipment of material for immediate use in Norway, such as
coal and sugar. Additional help was promised. These shipments
<span class='pageno' title='499' id='Page_499'></span>
were to be conducted under cover of a new trade company,
to be established in Germany or through especially
selected existing firms, while Hagelin was to act as consignee
in Norway. Hagelin had already conferred with the respective
Ministers of the Nygaardsvold Government, as for instance,
the Minister of Supply and Commerce, and had been assured
permission for the import of coal. At the same time, the coal
transports were to serve possibly to supply the technical
means necessary to launch Quisling’s political action in Oslo
with German help. It was Quisling’s plan to send a number
of selected, particularly reliable men to Germany for a brief
military training course in a completely isolated camp. They
were then to be detailed as area and language specialists to
German Special Troops, who were to be taken to Oslo on the
coal barges to accomplish a political action. Thus Quisling
planned to get hold of his leading opponents in Norway, including
the King, and to prevent all military resistance from
the very beginning. Immediately following this political action
and upon official request of Quisling to the Government
of the German Reich, the military occupation of Norway was
to take place. All military preparations were to be completed
previously. Though this plan contained the great advantage
of surprise, it also contained a great number of dangers which
could possibly cause its failure. For this reason it received a
quite dilatory treatment, while at the same time, it was not
disapproved as far as the Norwegians were concerned.</p>

<p>“In February, after a conference with General Field Marshal
Goering, Reichsleiter Rosenberg informed the Secretary in
the Office of the Four Year Plan, only of the intention to prepare
coal shipments to Norway to the named confidant Hagelin.
Further details were discussed in a conference between
Secretary Wohlthat, Staff Director Schickedanz, and Hagelin.
Since Wohlthat received no further instructions from the
General Field Marshal, Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop—after
a consultation with Reichsleiter Rosenberg—consented
to expedite these shipments through his office. Based on a
report of Reichsleiter Rosenberg to the Fuehrer it was also
arranged to pay Quisling ten thousand English pounds per
month for three months, commencing on the 15 of March, to
support his work”. (<span class='it'>004-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>This sum was paid through Scheidt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a letter to Ribbentrop dated 3 April 1940, Keitel wrote:
<span class='pageno' title='500' id='Page_500'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Dear Herr von Ribbentrop:</p>

<p>“The military occupation of Denmark and Norway has been,
by command of the Fuehrer, long in preparation by the High
Command of the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>. The High Command of the
<span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> has therefore had ample time to occupy itself
with all the questions connected with the carrying out of this
operation. The time at your disposal for the political preparation
of this operation, is on the contrary, very much shorter.
I believe myself therefore to be acting in accordance with
your own ideas in transmitting to you herewith, not only
these wishes of the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> which would have to be fulfilled
by the Governments in Oslo, Copenhagen and Stockholm
for purely military reasons, but also if I include a series of
requests which certainly concern the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> only indirectly
but which are, however, of the greatest importance for
the fulfillment of its task * * *.” (<span class='it'>D-629</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Keitel then proceeds to ask that the Foreign Office get in touch
with certain commanders. The important point is Keitel’s clear
admission to Ribbentrop that the military occupation of Denmark
and Norway had been long in preparation. It is interesting to
connect this letter with the official Biography of Ribbentrop,
in the Archives, which makes a point of mentioning the invasion
of Norway and Denmark (<span class='it'>D-472</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“With the occupation of Denmark and Norway on the 9 of
April 1940, only a few hours before the landing of British
troops in these territories, the battle began against the Western
Powers.” (<span class='it'>D-472</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is clear that whoever else had knowledge or whoever else was
ignorant, Ribbentrop had been thoroughly involved in the Quisling
plottings and knew at least a week before the invasion started that
the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> and Keitel had been long in preparation for this
act of aggression. (See also Section 9 of Chapter IX on Aggression
against Norway and Denmark.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(6) <span class='it'>The Low Countries: Belgium, The Netherlands, and Luxembourg.</span>
The facts as to the aggression against these countries,
during the period when Ribbentrop was Foreign Minister, are
discussed in Section 10 of Chapter IX. Special attention should
be called, however, to the statement made by Ribbentrop 10 May
1940 to representatives of the foreign press with regard to the
reasons for the German invasion of the Low Countries. These
reasons demonstrated to be false in Section 10 of Chapter IX
on Aggression Against The Low Countries.

<p class='pindent'>(7) <span class='it'>Greece and Yugoslavia.</span> At a meeting in Salzburg in
August 1939, at which von Ribbentrop participated, Hitler announced
that the Axis had decided to liquidate certain neutrals
(<span class='it'>1871-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * Generally speaking, it would be best to liquidate
the pseudo-neutrals one after the other. This is fairly easily
done, if one Axis partner protects the rear of the other, who
is just finishing off one of the uncertain neutrals, and vice
versa. Italy may consider Yugoslavia such an uncertain
neutral. At the visit of Prince Regent Paul he [the
Fuehrer] suggested, particularly in consideration of Italy,
that Prince Paul clarify his political attitude towards the
Axis by a gesture. He had thought of a closer connection
with the Axis and Yugoslavia’s leaving the League of Nations.
Prince Paul agreed to the latter. Recently the
Prince Regent was in London and sought reassurance from
the Western Powers. The same thing was repeated that
happened in the case of Gafencu, who was also very reasonable
during his visit to Germany and who denied any interest
in the aims of the western democracies. Afterwards
it was learned that he had later assumed a contrary standpoint
in England. Among the Balkan countries the Axis
can completely rely only on Bulgaria, which is in a sense a
natural ally of Italy and Germany. * * * At the moment
when there would be a turn to the worse for Germany
and Italy, however, Yugoslavia would join the other side
openly, hoping thereby to give matters a final turn to the
disadvantage of the Axis.” (<span class='it'>1871-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>That demonstrates the policy with regard to uncertain neutrals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, as early as September 1940 Ribbentrop reviewed the
war situation with Mussolini. Ribbentrop emphasized the heavy
revenge bombing raids in England and the fact that London
would soon be in ruins. It was agreed between the parties that
only Italian interests were involved in Greece and Yugoslavia,
and that Italy could count on German support. Ribbentrop went
on further to explain to Mussolini the Spanish plan for the attack
on Gibraltar and Germany’s participation therein. He
added that he was expecting to sign the Protocol with Spain,
bringing the latter country into the war, on his return to Berlin
(<span class='it'>1842-PS</span>). Ribbentrop then gave Mussolini a free hand
with Greece and Yugoslavia:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“With regard to Greece and Yugoslavia, the Foreign Minister
stressed that it was exclusively a question of Italian
interests, the settling of which was a matter for Italy alone,
<span class='pageno' title='502' id='Page_502'></span>
and in which Italy could be certain of Germany’s sympathetic
assistance.</p>

<p>“But it seemed to us to be better not to touch on these problems
for the time being, but to concentrate on the destruction
of England with all our forces instead. Where Germany
was concerned, she was interested in the northern
German districts (Norway, etc.), and this was acknowledged
by the Duce.” (<span class='it'>1842-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Several months later, in January 1941, at the meeting between
Hitler and Mussolini in which Ribbentrop participated,
the Greek operation was discussed. Hitler stated that the German
troops in Rumania were for use in the planned campaign
against Greece (<span class='it'>C-134</span>). Count Ciano, who attended that meeting
as Italian Foreign Minister, recalls his impression of that
meeting in his diary entry for 20/21 January:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Duce is pleased with the conversation on the whole.
I am less pleased, particularly as Ribbentrop, who had always
been so boastful in the past, told me, when I asked
him outright how long the war would last, that he saw no
possibility of its ending before 1942.” (<span class='it'>2987-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Despite that somewhat pessimistic statement to Count Ciano,
three weeks later, when it was a question of encouraging the
Japanese to enter the war, Ribbentrop took a more optimistic
line. On 13 February 1941 he saw Oshima, the Japanese Ambassador.
In the course of their conversation Ribbentrop gave
an optimistic account of the military situation and the position
of Bulgaria and Turkey (<span class='it'>1834-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of his efforts to get Yugoslavia to join the Axis,
Ribbentrop addressed a note, (<span class='it'>2450-PS</span>) on 25 March 1941, to
Prime Minister Cvetkovitch, which contained this assurance:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Axis-Power Governments during this war will not direct
a demand to Yugoslavia to permit the march or transportation
of troops through the Yugoslav state or territory.”
(<span class='it'>2450-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Shortly thereafter, there occurred the coup d’etat in Yugoslavia,
when General Simovitch took over the Government. Two
days after Ribbentrop’s assurance (<span class='it'>2450-PS</span>), at a meeting on
27 March 1941 at which Ribbentrop was present, Hitler outlined
the military campaign against Yugoslavia and promised the destruction
of Yugoslavia and the demolition of Belgrade by the
German Air Force (<span class='it'>1746-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the invasion of Yugoslavia Ribbentrop was one of the
persons directed by Hitler with the drawing of the boundaries
<span class='pageno' title='503' id='Page_503'></span>
for the partition and division of Yugoslavia. The preliminary
directive for that action provided:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * If the drawing up of boundaries has not been
laid down in the above Part I, it will be carried out by the
Supreme Command of the Armed Forces in agreement with
the Foreign Office [Ribbentrop], the Plenipotentiary for the
Four Year Plan [Goering], and the Reich Minister of the
Interior [Frick].” (<span class='it'>1195-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(8) <span class='it'>The U.S.S.R.</span> On 23 August 1939 Ribbentrop signed
the German-Soviet non-aggression Pact (<span class='it'>TC-25</span>). The first
point at which Ribbentrop seems to have considered special
problems of aggression against the Soviet Union was just after
20 April 1941, when Rosenberg and Ribbentrop met or communicated
to consider problems expected to arise in the Eastern
occupied territory. Ribbentrop appointed his Counsellor, Grosskopf,
to be his liaison man with Rosenberg and also assigned a
Consul General, Braeutigam, who had many years experience in
the USSR, as a collaborator with Rosenberg (<span class='it'>1039-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following month, on 18 May 1941, the German Foreign
Office prepared a declaration setting forth operational zones in
the Arctic Ocean and the Baltic and Black Seas to be used by
the German Navy and Air Force in the coming invasion of the
Soviet Union:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Foreign Office has prepared for use in <span class='it'>Barbarossa</span> the
attached draft of a declaration of operational zones. The
Foreign Office has, however, reserved its decision as to the
date when the declaration will be issued, as well as discussion
of particulars.” (<span class='it'>C-77</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, it is clear that Ribbentrop was again fully involved in
the preparation for this act of aggression. Finally, on 22 June
1941, Ribbentrop announced to the world that the German
armies were invading the USSR (<span class='it'>3054-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>How untrue were the reasons given by Ribbentrop is shown
by the report of his own Ambassador in Moscow on 7 June 1941,
who said that everything was being done by the Russians to
avoid a conflict.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(9) <span class='it'>Instigation of Japanese Aggression.</span> On 25 November
1936, as a result of negotiations of Ribbentrop as Ambassador
at Large, Germany and Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact
(<span class='it'>2508-PS</span>). The recital states the purpose of the agreement as
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Government of the German Reich and the Imperial
<span class='pageno' title='504' id='Page_504'></span>
Japanese Government, recognizing that the aim of the Communist
Internationale known as the Comintern is to disintegrate
and subdue existing States by all the means at its
command; convinced that the toleration of interference by
the Communist Internationale in the internal affairs of the
nations not only endangers their internal peace and social
well-being, but is also a menace to the peace of the world;
desirous of cooperating in the defense against Communist
subversive activities; having agreed as follows * * *.”
(<span class='it'>2508-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>There then follow the effective terms of the agreement under
which Germany and Japan are to act together for five years. It
is signed on behalf of Germany by Ribbentrop (<span class='it'>2508-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 27 September 1940 Ribbentrop, as Foreign Minister, signed
the Tripartite Pact with Japan and Italy, thereby bringing about
a full-scale military and economic alliance for the creation of a
new order in Europe and East Asia (<span class='it'>2643-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 13 February 1941—some four months later—Ribbentrop
was urging the Japanese to attack British possessions in the Far
East (<span class='it'>1834-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, in April 1941, at a meeting between Hitler and Matsuoka,
representing Japan, at which Ribbentrop was present, Hitler
promised that Germany would declare war on the United States
in the event of war occurring between Japan and the United
States as a result of Japanese aggression in the Pacific (<span class='it'>1881-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The development of Ribbentrop’s views is indicated by the
minutes of another conversation with the Japanese Foreign
Minister (<span class='it'>1882-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * Matsuoka then spoke of the general high morale in
Germany, referring to the happy faces he had seen everywhere
among the workers during his recent visit to the Borsig
Works. He expressed his regret that developments in
Japan had not as yet advanced as far as in Germany and that
in his country the intellectuals still exercised considerable
influence.</p>

<p>“The Reich Foreign Minister replied that at best a nation
which had realized its every ambition could afford the luxury
of intellectuals, most of whom are parasites, anyway. A
nation, however, which has to fight for a place in the sun
must give them up. The intellectuals ruined France; in Germany
they had already started their pernicious activities
when National Socialism put a stop to these doings; they
<span class='pageno' title='505' id='Page_505'></span>
will surely be the cause of the downfall of Britain, which is
to be expected with certainty * * *.” (<span class='it'>1882-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>That was on 5 April 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within a month after the German armies invaded the Soviet
Union on 22 June 1941, Ribbentrop was urging Ott, his ambassador
in Tokyo, to do his utmost to cause the Japanese Government
to attack the Soviet in Siberia (<span class='it'>2896-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2897-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>A message, intercepted, which was sent by the Japanese Ambassador
in Berlin on 29 November 1941, a week before the attack
on the United States at Pearl Harbor, reports the coaxings of
Ribbentrop:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Ribbentrop opened our meeting by again inquiring whether
I had received any reports regarding the Japanese-United
States negotiations. I replied that I had received no official
word.</p>

<p>“Ribbentrop: ‘It is essential that Japan effect the New
Order in East Asia without losing this opportunity. There
never has been and probably never will be a time when
closer cooperation under the Tripartite Pact is so important.
If Japan hesitates at this time, and Germany goes ahead and
establishes her European New Order, all the military might
of Britain and the United States will be concentrated against
Japan.</p>

<p>“ ‘As Fuehrer Hitler said today, there are fundamental differences
in the very right to exist between Germany and
Japan, and the United States. We have received advice to
the effect that there is practically no hope of the Japanese-United
States negotiations being concluded successfully because
of the fact that the United States is putting up a stiff
front.</p>

<p>“ ‘If this is indeed the fact of the case, and if Japan reaches
a decision to fight Britain and the United States, I am confident
that that will not only be to the interest of Germany
and Japan jointly, but would bring about favorable results
for Japan and herself.’ ” (<span class='it'>D-656</span>).</p>

</div>

<p>Then the Japanese Ambassador replied:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“ ‘I can make no definite statement as I am not aware of
any concrete intentions of Japan. Is Your Excellency indicating
that a state of actual war is to be established between
Germany and the United States?’</p>

<p>“Ribbentrop: ‘Roosevelt’s a fanatic, so it is impossible to
tell what he would do.’ ” (<span class='it'>D-656</span>).</p>

</div>

<p>The Japanese Ambassador thereupon concludes:
<span class='pageno' title='506' id='Page_506'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Concerning this point, in view of the fact that Ribbentrop
has said in the past that the United States would undoubtedly
try to avoid meeting German troops, and from the tone of
Hitler’s recent speech, as well as that of Ribbentrop’s, I
feel that German attitude toward the United States is being
considerably stiffened. There are indications at present that
Germany would not refuse to fight the United States if
necessary.” (<span class='it'>D-656</span>).</p>

</div>

<p>Part 3 of the Japanese message quotes Ribbentrop as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“In any event, Germany has absolutely no intention of entering
into any peace with England. We are determined to remove
all British influence from Europe. Therefore, at the
end of this war, England will have no influence whatsoever
in international affairs. The Island Empire of Britain may
remain, but all of her other possessions throughout the world
will probably be divided three ways by Germany, the United
States, and Japan. In Africa, Germany will be satisfied with,
roughly, those parts which were formerly German colonies.
Italy will be given the greater share of the African Colonies.
Germany desires, above all else, to control European Russia.”
(<span class='it'>D-656</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>In reply the Japanese Ambassador said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“ ‘I am fully aware of the fact that Germany’s war campaign
is progressing according to schedule smoothly. However, suppose
that Germany is faced with the situation of having not
only Great Britain as an actual enemy, but also having all
of those areas in which Britain has influence and those countries
which have been aiding Britain as actual enemies as
well. Under such circumstances, the war area will undergo
considerable expansion, of course. What is your opinion of
the outcome of the war under such an eventuality?’</p>

<p>“Ribbentrop: ‘We would like to end this war during next
year [1942]. However, under certain circumstances, it is
possible that it will have to be continued on to the following
year.</p>

<p>‘Should Japan become engaged in war against the United
States, Germany, of course, would join the war immediately.
There is absolutely no possibility of Germany’s entering into
a separate peace with the United States under such circumstances.
The Fuehrer is determined on that point.’ ” (<span class='it'>D-656</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Ribbentrop was thus associated in the closest possible way, with
the aggression by Japan against the United States.
<span class='pageno' title='507' id='Page_507'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Another intercepted diplomatic message from the Japanese
Ambassador in Berlin states (<span class='it'>D-657</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“At 1 p. m. today [8 December 1941] I called on Foreign Minister
Ribbentrop and told him our wish was to have Germany
and Italy issue formal declarations of war on America at once.
Ribbentrop replied that Hitler was then in the midst of a
conference at general headquarters discussing how the formalities
of declaring war could be carried out so as to make
a good impression on the German people, and that he would
transmit your wish to him at once and do whatever he was
able to have it carried out promptly. At that time Ribbentrop
told me that on the morning of the 8th Hitler issued
orders to the entire German Navy to attack American ships
whenever and wherever they might meet them.</p>

<p>“It goes without saying that this is only for your secret information.”
(<span class='it'>D-657</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Thus, Hitler ordered attacks on American ships before the German
declaration of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then on 11 December 1941 Ribbentrop, in the name of the German
Government, announced a state of war between Germany and
the United States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ribbentrop also made attempts to get Japan to attack the
Soviet Union. In his conversations with Oshima, the Japanese
Ambassador, in July 1942 and in March and April 1943, Ribbentrop
continued to urge Japanese participation and aggression
against the Soviet Union (<span class='it'>2911-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2954-PS</span>). The report of
a discussion between Ribbentrop and Ambassador Oshima reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Ambassador Oshima declared that he has received a telegram
from Tokyo, and he is to report, by order of his Government
to the Reich Minister for Foreign Affairs the following:</p>

<p>“The suggestion of the German Government to attack Russia
was the object of a common conference between the Japanese
Government and the Imperial headquarters, during which
the question was discussed in detail and investigated exactly.
The result is the following: The Japanese Government absolutely
recognizes the danger which threatens from Russia and
completely understands the desire of its German ally that
Japan on her part will also enter the war against Russia.
However, it is not possible for the Japanese Government,
considering the present war situation, to enter into the war.
It is rather of the conviction that it would be in the common
interest not to start the war against Russia now. On the other
<span class='pageno' title='508' id='Page_508'></span>
hand, the Japanese Government would never disregard the
Russian question.” (<span class='it'>2954-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Whereupon Ribbentrop returned to the attack:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“However, it would be more correct that all powers allied in
the Three Power Pact would combine their forces to defeat
England and America, but also Russia, together. It is not
good when one part must fight alone.” (<span class='it'>2954-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Ribbentrop’s pressure on Japan to attack Russia is shown in another
report of Japanese-German discussions on 18 April 1943
(<span class='it'>2929-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Reichsminister for Foreign Affairs then stressed again
that without any doubt this year presented the most favorable
opportunity for Japan, if she felt strong enough and had
sufficient antitank weapons at her disposal, to attack Russia,
which certainly would never again be as weak as she is at the
moment * * *.” (<span class='it'>2929-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<h3>C. <span class='it'>RIBBENTROP’S PART IN THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT WAR CRIMES AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(The following discussion concerns only the planning of these
crimes. The execution of the crimes was left to the French and
Soviet prosecuting staffs for proof.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>The Killing of Allied Aviators.</span> With the increasing air
raids on German cities in 1944 by the Allied Air Forces, the German
Government proposed to undertake a plan to deter Anglo-American
fliers from further raids on Reich cities. In a report of
a meeting at which a definite policy was to be established, there
is stated the point of view that Ribbentrop had been urging
(<span class='it'>735-PS</span>). The meeting took place at the Fuehrer’s headquarters
on 6 June 1944, and proceeded in part as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>Obergruppenfuehrer</span> Kaltenbrunner informed the Deputy
Chief of WFSt in Klessheim, on the afternoon of the 6th of
June, that a conference on this question had been held shortly
before between the Reich Marshal [Goering], the Reich Foreign
Minister [Ribbentrop], and the Reichsfuehrer SS
[Himmler]. Contrary to the original suggestion made by
the Reich Foreign Minister, who wished to include every type
of terror attack on the German civilian population, that is,
also bombing attacks on cities, it was agreed in the above
conference that merely those attacks carried out with aircraft
armament, aimed directly at the civilian population and
their property, should be taken as the standard for the evidence
of a criminal action in this sense. Lynch law would
<span class='pageno' title='509' id='Page_509'></span>
have to be the rule. On the contrary, there has been no question
of court martial sentence or handing over to the police.”
(<span class='it'>735-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>That is, Ribbentrop was pressing that even where there was an
attack on a German city, the airmen who crash-landed should be
handed over to be lynched by the crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The minutes of the conference report further as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Deputy Chief of the WFSt mentioned that apart from lynch
law, a procedure must be worked out for segregating those
enemy aviators who are suspected of criminal action of this
kind until they are received into the reception camp for aviators
at Oberursel; if the suspicion was confirmed, they would
be handed over to the SD for special treatment.” (<span class='it'>735-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The sense of this seems to be that if they were not lynched
under the first scheme, by the crowd, then they were to be kept
from prisoners of war, where they would be subject to the protecting
power’s intervention. And if the suspicion was confirmed,
they would be handed over to the SD to be killed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conference reached a decision on what would be regarded
as justifying lynch law:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“At a conference with Colonel von Brauchitsch, representing
the C-in-C, Air Force, on the 6th of June, it was settled that
the following actions were to be regarded as terror actions
justifying lynch law:</p>

<p>“Low-level attacks with aircraft armament on the civilian
population, single persons as well as crowds.</p>

<p>“Shooting our own men in the air who had bailed out.</p>

<p>“Attacks with aircraft armament on passenger trains in the
public service.</p>

<p>“Attacks with aircraft armament on military hospitals, hospitals,
and hospital trains, which are clearly marked with
the Red Cross.” (<span class='it'>735-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>These were to be the subject of lynching and not, as Ribbentrop
had suggested, the case of the bombing of a city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the latter part of this report there occurs a somewhat curious
comment from Keitel:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“If one allows the people to carry out lynch law, it is difficult
to enforce rules!</p>

<p>“Minister Director Berndt got out and shot the enemy aviator
on the road. I am against legal procedure. It doesn’t work
out.” (<span class='it'>735-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>That is signed by Keitel.
<span class='pageno' title='510' id='Page_510'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The remarks of Jodl then appear:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“This conference is insufficient. The following points must
be decided quite definitely in conjunction with the Foreign
Office:</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“(Signed) Jodl” (<span class='it'>735-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is important to note that Ribbentrop and the Foreign Office
were fully involved in these breaches of the laws and usages of
war. The clarity with which the Foreign Office perceived that
there were such violations is indicated by a document from the
Foreign Office, approved of by Ribbentrop and transmitted by
one of his officials, Ritter (<span class='it'>728-PS</span>). The approval of Ribbentrop
is specifically stated in a memorandum of 30 June 1944 (<span class='it'>740-PS</span>).
The Foreign Office document reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“In spite of the obvious objections, founded on international
law and foreign politics, the Foreign Office is basically in
agreement with the proposed measures.</p>

<p>“In the examination of the individual cases, a distinction
must be made between the cases of lynching and the cases of
special treatment by the Security Service, SD.</p>

<p>“1. In the cases of lynching, the precise establishment of the
circumstances deserving punishment, according to points 1-4
of the communication of 15 June, is not very essential. First,
the German authorities are not directly responsible, since
death had occurred before a German official became concerned
with the case. Furthermore, the accompanying circumstances
will be such that it will not be difficult to depict the
case in an appropriate manner upon publication. Hence, in
cases of lynching, it will be of primary importance correctly
to handle the individual case upon publication.</p>

<p>“2. The suggested procedure for special treatment by the
S.D., including subsequent publication, would be tenable only
if Germany, on this occasion, simultaneously would openly
repudiate the commitment of International Law, presently
in force, and still recognized by Germany. When an enemy
aviator is seized by the Army or by the Police, and is delivered
to the Air Forces (P.W.) Reception Camp Oberursel,
<span class='pageno' title='511' id='Page_511'></span>
he has received, by this very fact, the legal status of a prisoner
of war.</p>

<p>“The Prisoner of War Treaty of 27 July 1929 establishes
definite rules on the prosecution and sentencing of the Prisoner
of War, and the execution of the death penalty, as for
example in Article 66: Death sentences may be carried out
only three months after the protective power has been notified
of the sentence; in Article 63: a prisoner of war will be
tried only by the same courts and under the same procedure
as members of the German Armed Forces. These rules are
so specific, that it would be futile to try to cover up any violation
of them by clever wording of the publication of an individual
incident. On the other hand the Foreign Office cannot
recommend on this occasion a formal repudiation of the
Prisoner of War Treaty.</p>

<p>“An emergency solution would be to prevent suspected fliers
from ever attaining a legal Prisoner of War status, that is,
that immediately upon seizure they be told that they are not
considered Prisoners of War but criminals; that they would
not be turned over to the agencies having jurisdiction over
Prisoners of War; hence not go to a Prisoner of War Camp;
but that they would be delivered to the authorities in charge
of the prosecution of criminal acts and that they would be
tried in a summary proceeding. If the evidence at the trial
should reveal that the special procedure is not applicable to
a particular case, the fliers concerned may subsequently be
given the status of Prisoner of War by transfer to the Air
Forces (P.W.) Reception Camp Oberursel.</p>

<p>“Naturally, not even this expedient will prevent the possibility
that Germany will be accused of the violation of existing
treaties, and maybe not even the adoption of reprisals
upon German prisoners of war. At any rate this solution
would enable us clearly to define our attitude, thus relieving
us of the necessity of openly having to renounce the present
agreements or of the need of having to use excuses, which no
one would believe, upon the publication of each individual
case.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“It follows from the above, that the main weight of the
action will have to be placed on lynchings. Should the campaign
be carried out to such an extent that the purpose, to
wit ‘the deterrence of enemy aviators’, is actually achieved,
which goal is favored by the Foreign Office, then the strafing
attacks by enemy fliers upon the civilian populations must
<span class='pageno' title='512' id='Page_512'></span>
be stressed in a completely different propagandist manner
than heretofore.” (<span class='it'>728-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p>Those words show clearly Ribbentrop’s point of view:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Ambassador Ritter has advised us by telephone on 29 June
that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has approved this
draft.” (<span class='it'>740-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, on the treatment of aviators, Ribbentrop furthered the
deliberate adoption of a procedure evading International Law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>The Destruction of the Peoples in Europe.</span> With regard to
Poland, the affidavit of Lahousen reports Ribbentrop participation
in a discussion on 12 September 1939 on the Fuehrer’s train
concerning the extermination of Poles and Jews (<span class='it'>Affidavit A</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>With regard to Bohemia and Moravia, on 16 March 1939 there
was promulgated the decree of the Fuehrer and Reichschancellor,
signed by Ribbentrop, establishing the protectorate (<span class='it'>TC-51</span>). The
effect of that decree was to place the Reich Protector in a position
of supreme power over Bohemia and Moravia, subordinate only
to the Fuehrer. Article 5 of that decree provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * 2. The Reich Protector, as representative of the
Fuehrer and Chancellor of the Reich, and as commissioner of
the Reich Government, is charged with the duty of seeing to
the observance of the political principles laid down by the
Fuehrer and Chancellor of the Reich.</p>

<p>“3. The members of the government of the Protectorate shall
be confirmed by the Reich Protector. The confirmation may
be withdrawn.</p>

<p>“4. The Reich Protector is entitled to inform himself of all
measures taken by the government of the Protectorate and
to give advice. He can object to measures calculated to harm
the Reich, and, in case of danger, issue ordinances required
for the common interest.” (<span class='it'>TC-51</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>It is further provided that the promulgation of laws and the
execution of certain judgments shall be annulled if the Reich
Protector enters an objection (<span class='it'>TC-51</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In part as a result of the sweeping terms of this law, the two
Reich Protectors of Bohemia and Moravia and their various deputies
were able to commit numerous violations of the laws of war,
and crimes against humanity. (Discussion of these matters was
assumed as the responsibility of the Soviet prosecuting staff.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Similarly, with regard to the Netherlands, on 18 May 1940 a
decree of the Fuehrer concerning the exercise of governmental
authority in the Netherlands was signed by Ribbentrop. Section
1 of that decree provided (<span class='it'>D-639</span>):
<span class='pageno' title='513' id='Page_513'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The occupied Netherlands territories shall be administered
by the Reich Commissioner for the Occupied Netherlands
territories * * * the Reich Commissioner is guardian
of the interests of the Reich and vested with supreme civil
authority.</p>

<p>“Dr. Arthur Seyss-Inquart is hereby appointed Reich Commissioner
for the Occupied Netherlands Territories.”
(<span class='it'>D-639</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On the basis of this decree, the Reich Commissioner, Seyss-Inquart,
promulgated such orders as that of 4 July 1940, confiscating
the property of those who had, or might have, furthered
activities hostile to the German Reich (<span class='it'>2921-PS</span>). Tentative
arrangements were also made for the resettlement of the Dutch
population (<span class='it'>1520-PS</span>). (This part of the proof was assumed as
the responsibility of the French prosecuting staff.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>With regard to Bohemia and the Netherlands, the charge
against Ribbentrop is laying the basis and erecting the governmental
structure under which the war crimes and crimes against
humanity were directed and facilitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Persecution of the Jews.</span> In December 1938 Ribbentrop,
in a conversation with M. Bonnet, who was then Foreign Minister
of France, expressed his opinion of the Jews. That was reported
by the United States Ambassador, Mr. Kennedy, to the State Department
as follows (<span class='it'>L-205</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“During the day we had a telephone call from Berenger’s
office in Paris. We were told that the matter of refugees
had been raised by Bonnet in his conversation with von Ribbentrop.
The result was very bad. Ribbentrop, when pressed,
had said to Bonnet that the Jews in Germany without exception
were pickpockets, murderers and thieves. The property
they possessed had been acquired illegally. The German Government
had therefore decided to assimilate them with the
criminal elements of the population. The property which
they had acquired illegally would be taken from them. They
would be forced to live in districts frequented by the criminal
classes. They would be under police observation like other
criminals. They would be forced to report to the police as
other criminals were obliged to do. The German Government
could not help it if some of these criminals escaped to
other countries which seemed so anxious to have them. It
was not, however, willing for them to take the property which
had resulted from their illegal operations with them. There
was in fact nothing that it could or would do.” (<span class='it'>L-205</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='514' id='Page_514'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>That succinct statement of Ribbentrop’s views on Jews is
elaborated in a long document which he had sent out by the Foreign
Office (<span class='it'>3358-PS</span>). This document, entitled “The Jewish
Question As A Factor In German Foreign Policy in the year
1938” contains the following:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“It is certainly no coincidence that the fateful year 1938 has
brought nearer the solution of the Jewish question simultaneously
with the realization of the ‘idea of Greater Germany’,
since the Jewish policy was both the basis and consequence
of the events of the year 1938.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The final goal of German Jewish policy is the emigration
of all Jews living in Reich territory.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“These examples from reports from authorities abroad can,
if desired, be amplified. They confirm the correctness of the
expectation that criticism of the measures for excluding
Jews from German <span class='it'>lebensraum</span>, which were misunderstood
in many countries for lack of evidence, would only be temporary
and would swing in the other direction the moment
the population saw with its own eyes and thus learned what
the Jewish danger was to them. The poorer and therefore
the more burdensome the immigrant Jew to the country absorbing
him, the stronger this country will react and the more
desirable is this effect in the interest of German propaganda.
The object of this German action is to be the future international
solution of the Jewish question, dictated not by false
compassion for the ‘United Religious Jewish minority’ but
by the full consciousness of all peoples of the danger which
it represents to the racial composition of the nations.”
(<span class='it'>3358-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This document was widely circulated by Ribbentrop’s ministry,
to all senior Reich authorities and to numerous other people on
25 January 1939, just after the statement to M. Bonnet. Apparently
Ribbentrop’s anti-Semitic incitements grew stronger, for
in June 1944 Rosenberg made arrangements for an international
anti-Jewish Congress to be held in Krakow on 11 July 1944. The
honorary members were to be Ribbentrop, Himmler, Goebbels,
and Frank. The Foreign Office was to take over the mission of
inviting prominent foreigners from Italy, France, Hungary, Holland,
Arabia, Iraq, Norway etc. in order to give an international
aspect to the Congress. However, the military events of June
1944 prompted Hitler to call off the Congress, which had lost its
<span class='pageno' title='515' id='Page_515'></span>
significance by virtue of the Allied landing in Normandy
(<span class='it'>1752-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is clear that Ribbentrop supported and encouraged the Nazi
program against the Jews, which resulted in their transportation
to concentration camps, where things went on which he, as a
minister in special touch with the head of the government must
have known about. As one who preached this doctrine and was
in a position of authority, Ribbentrop cannot suggest that he was
ignorant of how the policy was carried out.</p>

<h3>D. <span class='it'>CONCLUSION</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler summed up Ribbentrop’s contribution to the Nazi conspiracy
for aggression, as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the historic year of 1938 the Foreign Minister, von Ribbentrop,
was of great help to me, in view of his accurate and
audacious judgment and the exceptionally clever treatment
of all problems of foreign policy.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>During the course of the war, Ribbentrop was in close liaison
with the other Nazi conspirators. He advised them and made
available to them, through his foreign embassies and legations
abroad, information which was required. He at times participated
in the planning of war crimes and crimes against humanity.
His guilt is clear.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg528a'>4. WILHELM KEITEL</h2>

<h3>A. <span class='it'>POSITIONS HELD BY KEITEL.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Chief of the Armed Forces Department in the Reichs Ministry
of War (<span class='it'>Wehrmachtsamt in Reichskriegsministerium</span>), 1 October
1935 to 4 February 1938. (<span class='it'>3019-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chief of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces (Chief of
OKW), equal in rank to a Reichs Minister. (<span class='it'>1915-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Member of the Secret Cabinet Council, 4 February 1938 to 1945.
(<span class='it'>2031-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Member of Ministerial Council for the defense of the Reich, 30
August 1939 to 1945. (<span class='it'>2018-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Member of Reichs Defense Council, 4 September 1938 to 1945.
(<span class='it'>2194-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Field Marshal, July 1940 to 1945. (<span class='it'>3020-PS</span>)</p>

<h3>B. <span class='it'>FUNCTIONS OF KEITEL.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>As Chief of the <span class='it'>Wehrmachtsamt</span> in the Ministry of War, Keitel
was Chief of Staff for von Blomberg, who was both Minister of
War and Commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 4 February 1938 Hitler abolished the Ministry of War, assumed
direct command of the Armed Forces himself, and created
the OKW (<span class='it'>Oberkommando der Wehrmacht</span>). The OKW
advised Hitler on the most important military questions, and
prepared and transmitted directives to the Armed Forces. Thus
it exercised great influence on the formation of the German military
policy and the conduct of military affairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Keitel was made Chief of the OKW, with rank equal to that of
Reichsminister. He was also given authorities of the former
Minister of War, and continued to perform the administrative
duties of that position. (<span class='it'>1915-PS</span>; <span class='it'>1954-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3704-PS</span>)
<span class='pageno' title='529' id='Page_529'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to its ministerial functions, the OKW was Hitler’s
military staff. Its most important duty was the development
of strategic and operational plans. Such plans were worked out
by the OKW Operations Staff in broad outline, and then in more
detail by the commanders and chiefs of staff of the Army, Navy,
and Air Force. After Hitler had approved the plans they were
transmitted by the OKW to the respective military authorities.
(<span class='it'>3705-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3702-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3707-PS</span>).</p>

<h3>C. <span class='it'>KEITEL’S PART IN THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT CRIMES AGAINST PEACE.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Keitel’s conspiratorial activities started immediately after the
Nazis came to power. As early as in May 1933, when Germany
was still a member of the League of Nations, Keitel gave directives
for deceiving “Geneva” in rearmament matters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the second meeting of the Working Committee of the Councillors
for Reich Defense on 22 May 1933, Colonel Keitel emphasized
that the supreme consideration guiding the work of the
committee was to be secrecy. “No document”, he said, “ought to
be lost, since otherwise it may fall into the hands of the enemy’s
intelligence service. Orally transmitted matters are not provable;
they can be denied by us in Geneva.” He requested that
written documents not be sent through the mails, or, if it was
absolutely necessary to do so, that they be addressed, not to a
government agency or office (where they might be opened by the
mail clerks) but to the recipient personally. (<span class='it'>EC-177</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fact that Keitel was a member of the Nazi conspiracy in
good standing is apparent from his statement that he held the
Golden Party Badge, and that consequently the Party considered
him a member as from the autumn of 1944, when the law against
military personnel being members of the Party was changed
(1944 RGBl. I, 317). His political convictions were those of National
Socialism, and he was a loyal follower of Hitler. (<span class='it'>1954-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the second meeting of the Working Committee of the Councillors
for Reich Defense held on 26 April 1933, the chairman,
Colonel Keitel, pointed out the necessity and desirability for the
creation of the Reich Defense Council which had been determined
on by a cabinet decision of 4 April 1933. He said that a general
program for the creation of a war economy had already been
completed, but that it would take a long time to carry out the
program. He explained that it was the purpose and objective
of the Working Committee of the new Defense Council to overcome
these difficulties. (<span class='it'>EC-177</span>)
<span class='pageno' title='530' id='Page_530'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>On 6 December 1935 General Major Keitel, chairman of the
eleventh meeting of the Reich Defense Council, pointed out that
the mobilization year was to begin on 1 April and to end on 31
March of the following year. For the first time, a “Mobilization
Book for Civilian Agencies” was to be issued on 1 April 1936.
Keitel said that this day, to the extent possible, should find the
nation ready and prepared. He declared that, according to the
will of the Fuehrer, the economic management of the country
should put the enhancement of military capacity above all other
national tasks. Keitel emphasized that it was the function of all
members of the Reich Defense Council to use all available resources
economically and to ask for only such funds and raw materials
as were absolutely and exclusively needed for the defense
of the Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the presence of Keitel, Colonel Jodl said that the “Mobilization
Book for the Civilian Agencies” constituted the unified basis
for the carrying out of mobilization outside of the Army. (<span class='it'>EC-406</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The twelfth meeting of the Working Committee of the Reich
Defense Council, held on 14 May 1936, was opened by Field Marshal
von Blomberg, War Minister and Supreme Army Commander.
He stressed the necessity for a total mobilization, including
the drafting of the necessary laws, preparations in the
re-militarized Rhineland zone, financing and rearmament. Lt.
General Keitel, in his capacity as chairman of the Working Committee
of the Reich Defense Council, again stressed the necessity
for secrecy. Ministerial Director Wohlthat pointed out that, in
order to guarantee rearmament and an adequate food supply, an
increase in production and utmost economy were necessary, a
postulate that had led to the special mandate given by the
Fuehrer to Minister President Goering. (<span class='it'>EC-407</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Keitel participated also in the activities of the conspirators to
re-militarize the Rhineland. At that time he was Chief of the
<span class='it'>Wehrmachtsamt</span> under von Blomberg and signed, on the latter’s
behalf, the order for naval participation in the operation. (<span class='it'>C-194</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Keitel also took part in the war-planning activities of the
Reich Cabinet, of which he was a member. The cabinet consulted
by meetings, and by the circulation of decrees among its
members for their approval or disapproval. (See generally
Section 3 of Chapter XV on the Reich Cabinet.) Keitel was a
member of the Secret Cabinet Council, which has been described
as “a select committee” of the cabinet for deliberation on foreign
affairs. (<span class='it'>1774-PS</span>)
<span class='pageno' title='531' id='Page_531'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>A Reich Defense Council was established by the ordinary cabinet
in 1933. It was a war-planning group, and Keitel took part
in the meetings of its working committee. (<span class='it'>EC-177</span>; <span class='it'>EC-406</span>;
<span class='it'>EC-407</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 4 December 1938 a Secret Defense Law was passed, which
defined the duties of the Reich Defense Council. As Chief of
OKW, Keitel was a member of the council, and he also presided
over the Council’s Working Committee (<span class='it'>Reichsverteidigungsausschuss</span>).
(<span class='it'>2194-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Secret Defense Law of 1938 provided for a Plenipotentiary
for Economy, whose task was to “put all economic forces into
the service of the Reich defense, and to safeguard economically
the life of the German nation”, and for a Plenipotentiary for
Administration, whose duties were to take over “the uniform
leadership of the non-military administration with exception of
the economic administration” upon the declaration of a “state of
defense”. Certain ministries were, in peace-time, bound by the
directives of the plenipotentiaries. The latter were bound, in
turn, under certain conditions, together with the ministries subordinate
to them, to take directions from the Chief of OKW.
Keitel could also, in a state of defense, issue orders to the Minister
of Transport and the Minister of Posts. In addition, he
presided over the Council’s Working Committee, which prepared
the Council’s decisions, saw that they were executed, and obtained
collaboration between the armed forces, the chief Reich
offices, and the Party. Keitel regulated the activities of this
committee and issued directions to the plenipotentiaries and certain
Reich ministries to assure uniform execution of the council’s
decisions. (<span class='it'>2194-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two plenipotentiaries and the OKW formed what was
known as a “Three Man College” (<span class='it'>2608-PS</span>). This system of
a three man college functioned as follows, from a legislative
point of view: The Plenipotentiary for Economy was empowered
by paragraph 4 of the Secret Defense Law of 4 September 1938
to issue laws within his sphere, with the consent of the OKW
and the Plenipotentiary for Administration, which differed from
existing laws. Similarly, the Plenipotentiary for Administration
was empowered by paragraph 3 of the same law to issue laws
within his sphere, with the consent of the OKW and the Plenipotentiary
for Economy, which differed from existing laws.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the spheres of the Reich Minister of Posts, the Reich Minister
of Transport and of the General Inspector for German roads
(<span class='it'>Generalinspektor fuer die Strassenwesen</span>), the Chief of the OKW
had the right, under paragraph 5 of the same law, to issue laws,
<span class='pageno' title='532' id='Page_532'></span>
in agreement with the Plenipotentiaries for Administration and
Economy, which differed from existing laws. (<span class='it'>2194-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The legislative function of the three man college, prior to 9
September 1939 was one of drafting decrees to be used in time
of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Council of Ministers for the Defense of the Reich was
established by a decree of Hitler on 30 August 1939. It was
formed out of the Reich Defense Council, and included among its
members the two plenipotentiaries of the council and the Chief
of OKW. (<span class='it'>2018-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Council had the power to pass decrees with the force of
law, and to legislate for the occupied Eastern Territories (1939
RGBl, I, 2077). Decrees of the council were circulated, before
enactment, among all the members by written communication
from Dr. Lammers, who was also on the Council. (<span class='it'>2231-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frick has referred to the Council of Ministers as “the highest
permanent organ of the Reich with comprehensive jurisdiction,
responsible only to the Fuehrer”. “The composition of the Ministerial
Council for the Defense of the Reich”, he added, “shows
the real concentration of power in it”. He said also that Keitel
was liaison between the council and the armed forces, it being
primarily his duty to coordinate the measures for civilian defense
in the area of administration and economy with the genuine
military measures for the defense of the Reich. (<span class='it'>2608-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Keitel also took an active part in collaborating with and in
instigating the Japanese to enter the war. Nazi policy with regard
to Japan was expressed in an order signed by Keitel on
5 March 1941. This order was distributed to the OKH, OKM, and
OKL, and also to Jodl. It stated that Japan must be drawn actively
into the war, and that the taking of Singapore would mean a decisive
success for the three powers. (<span class='it'>C-75</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>At about the time this order was issued, a meeting was held
with Hitler, in which Raeder urged that Japan be induced to
attack Singapore. Keitel and Jodl were both present at this
meeting. (<span class='it'>C-152</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Keitel may have known of a report from the Military Attache
in Tokyo that preparations were continuing for a sudden attack
on Singapore and Manila. (<span class='it'>1538-PS</span>)</p>

<h3>D. <span class='it'>KEITEL’S PART IN PLANNING AND LAUNCHING WARS OF AGGRESSION.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>(<span class='it'>See “F” 1 through 7, infra, where the joint responsibility of
Keitel and Jodl for these activities is discussed.</span>)</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='533' id='Page_533'></span></p>

<h3>E. <span class='it'>KEITEL’S PART IN THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT WAR CRIMES AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Murder and ill treatment of civilian populations in occupied
territory and on the high seas.</span> Keitel committed many
crimes of this nature, by ordering such criminal activities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 13 May 1941 Keitel, as Chief of OKW, signed an order from
the Fuehrer’s Headquarters providing that Russian civilians
suspected of offenses against German troops should be shot or
ruthlessly punished without a military trial, and that prosecution
of German soldiers for offenses against Russian civilians was not
required (<span class='it'>C-50</span>). On 27 July 1941 he ordered that all copies of
this decree should be destroyed, but without affecting its validity.
(<span class='it'>C-51</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 23 July 1941 Keitel signed an order concerning the administration
of occupied Russia. This order provided that legal punishments
were inadequate in so great an area, and that troops
should use terrorism in crushing the population’s will to resist.
(<span class='it'>C-52</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Keitel signed one of the so-called <span class='it'>Nacht und Nebel</span> decrees
on 7 December 1941. It provided that in occupied territories of
the west civilians would be tried for offenses against the German
state only if the death sentence was likely to be carried out within
a few days of arrest. Otherwise the accused would be taken
to Germany, and no information would be given about them in
reply to any inquiries. (<span class='it'>666-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>By a first ordinance of 7 December 1941 Keitel made the provisions
of the foregoing directive applicable to the following offenses;
attacks against life or bodily health, espionage, sabotage,
communistic conspiracy, offenses likely to create disturbances,
assistance to the enemy, and illicit possession of arms. His
ordinance also provided that the offenses mentioned were to be
tried in the occupied countries only if it were likely that the
death sentence would be pronounced, and if it were possible to
complete trial and execution within a very short time, as a rule
within a week after arrest. In case of trial in Germany, it was
provided that alien witnesses could be heard only with the consent
of the High Command of the Armed Forces and that the
public would not be admitted to the proceedings. (<span class='it'>L-90</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a communication issued by him in his capacity as Chief
of the High Command of the Armed Forces Keitel on 12 December
1941 stated with respect to the aforementioned directive and
ordinance:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Efficient and enduring terrorization can be achieved only
<span class='pageno' title='534' id='Page_534'></span>
either by capital punishment or by measures to keep the
relatives of the criminal and the population in the dark as
to the fate of the criminal. This aim is achieved by transferring
the criminal to Germany.” (<span class='it'>L-90</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In pursuance of Keitel’s <span class='it'>Nacht und Nebel</span> decree, Admiral
Canaris on 2 February 1942 issued instructions to the <span class='it'>Abwehr</span>
to punish crimes against the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> accordingly. At first
the order was to apply only to Norway, Holland, Belgium, and
France. (<span class='it'>833-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Chief of the SIPO and SD reported to OKW on 24 June
1942 that a Frenchman had died while awaiting trial in Germany,
and that, in order to create anxiety in accordance with the decree,
his family had not been notified. Keitel’s OKW approved of this
procedure, which had been established for such cases by an OKW
order of 16 April 1942. (<span class='it'>668-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>When, on 20 April 1941 Hitler appointed Rosenberg “Deputy
for a Centralized Treatment of Problems concerning the Eastern
Territories,” Keitel was asked to designate a representative of
OKW to sit with Rosenberg. Keitel designated Jodl as his representative
and Warlimont as deputy. (<span class='it'>865-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus Keitel and Jodl share the responsibility for crimes committed
by Rosenberg’s administration. In this connection reference
is made to section 7 of this chapter on Rosenberg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the decrees issued by the Council of Ministers, of which
Keitel was a member, are two which connect him with harsh
treatment of inhabitants of the Occupied Eastern Territories.
(<span class='it'>2746-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2039-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Deportation of civilian populations in occupied territories
for slave labor and other purposes.</span> Keitel’s connection with the
forced labor program began at a meeting with Hitler on 23 May
1939, when it was announced that Poland would be invaded, and
also that non-German populations would be available as a source
of labor. (<span class='it'>L-79</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Keitel directed the execution of Hitler’s order to use Russian
prisoners of war in German war industries, and stated that OKW
(AWA) would furnish to the Secretary of Labor information on
the use of such labor, and provide the labor force. (<span class='it'>EC-194</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sauckel was appointed Plenipotentiary General for Manpower
by a decree of 21 March 1942, signed by Hitler, Lammers, and
Keitel. (<span class='it'>1666-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 8 September 1942 Keitel initialled a Hitler order requiring
citizens of France, Holland, and Belgium to work on the “Atlantic
Wall”. The order was to be enforced by the withdrawal of food
<span class='pageno' title='535' id='Page_535'></span>
and clothing ration cards (<span class='it'>556-2-PS</span>). Keitel was informed of
the quotas of foreign laborers which Sauckel and his agents were
to fill. Sauckel requested the assistance of the Army, and asked
that pressure be used to obtain the quotas, if necessary. (<span class='it'>3012-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a conference with Hitler on 4 January 1944, at which Keitel
was present, it was determined that Sauckel should obtain 4,000,000
new workers from occupied territories. (<span class='it'>1292-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Murder and ill treatment of prisoners of war, and of other
members of the armed forces of the countries with which Germany
was at war, and of persons on the high seas.</span> On 18 October
1942 Hitler ordered that commando troops, even if in uniform,
should be killed, not only in battle, but in flight or while attempting
to surrender (<span class='it'>498-PS</span>). An order regulating the treatment
of paratroopers had been issued by Keitel about a month earlier.
It provided that captured paratroopers were to be turned over to
the SD. (<span class='it'>553-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>A supplementary explanation of the commando order, signed
by Hitler, was distributed to commanding officers only, with a
covering memorandum dated 19 October 1942, signed by Jodl
(<span class='it'>503-PS</span>). Several cases are known in which the order was carried
out (<span class='it'>508-PS</span>; <span class='it'>509-PS</span>). Three specific instances were mentioned
by the G-3 of the C-in-C, Norway, where captured members
of sabotage units were executed after interrogations which
resulted in valuable intelligence. These occurred at Glomfjord,
Drontheim, and Stavanger. (<span class='it'>512-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 23 June 1944 the Supreme Command West requested instructions
redefining the scope of the commando order. In view
of the extensive landings in Normandy, it had become difficult to
decide which paratroops should be considered sabotage troops
under the terms of the order, and which should be considered as
engaged in normal combat operations. The question was answered
by an order of 25 June 1944, one copy of which was
signed by Keitel, reaffirming the full force of the original order
(<span class='it'>531-PS</span>; <span class='it'>551-PS</span>). Keitel extended the application of the commando
order to members of Anglo-American and Russian “military
missions” taken in the fighting against the partisans in the
southeast and southwest. (<span class='it'>537-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>When allied fliers were forced to land in Germany, they were
sometimes killed by the civilian population. The police had
orders not to protect the fliers, nor to punish civilians for lynching
them. A proposal was considered to order the shooting without
court-martial of enemy airmen who had been forced down
<span class='pageno' title='536' id='Page_536'></span>
after engaging in specified “acts of terror”. Whether or not the
order was ever issued is immaterial, for it is certain that Keitel
and Jodl knew of the lynchings, did nothing to prevent them,
and in fact considered giving them official justification.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>(<span class='it'>See also “F”, 8, infra, in which the joint responsibility of
Keitel and Jodl for the lynching of Allied airmen is discussed.</span>)</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Keitel’s criminal activities against Soviet prisoners of war are
shown by the following. On 8 September 1941 Keitel’s OKW issued
a regulation for the treatment of Soviet prisoners of war. It
stated that Russian soldiers would fight by any methods for the
idea of Bolshevism and that consequently they had lost any claim
to treatment in accordance with the Geneva Convention. Stern
measures were to be employed against them, including the free
use of weapons. The politically undesirable prisoners were to be
segregated from the others and turned over to “special purpose
units” of the Security Police and the Security Service. There was
to be the closest cooperation between the military commanders
and these police units. (<span class='it'>1519-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Admiral Canaris of the Abwehr considered this order in such
direct violation of the general principles of International Law
that he addressed a memorandum of protest to Keitel on 15 September
1941. He pointed out that, while the Geneva Convention
was not binding between Germany and the USSR, the usual
rules of International Law should be observed; that such instructions,
particularly those concerning the use of weapons, would
result in arbitrary killings; and that the disposition of politically
undesirable prisoners would be decided by the SIPO and the SD
according to principles of which the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> was ignorant.
(As to this argument, Keitel wrote in the margin “Very efficient”
and “Not at all.”) Keitel received and considered this memorandum,
for on its first page there is the following comment in
his handwriting, dated 23 September and initialled “K”:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The objections arise from the military concept of chivalrous
warfare. This is the destruction of an ideology. Therefore
I approve and back the measures.” (<span class='it'>EC-338</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The regulations which Canaris had protested were restated on
24 March 1942, but their essential provisions were unchanged.
(<span class='it'>695-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>An order of Keitel’s OKW dated 29 January 1943, signed by
Reinecke, contains a broad interpretation of the guards’ right
of self-defense against prisoners. For example, self-defense includes
not only the guard’s person, but his honor and property,
and third parties, such as the State. (<span class='it'>656-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>That Keitel knew of the appalling treatment of Russian prisoners
<span class='pageno' title='537' id='Page_537'></span>
of war, and the high death rate among them, appears from
the statements in a letter sent to him by Rosenberg on 28 February
1942. The letter stressed the need for better treatment of
the Russians, so that they would be well impressed by the Germans.
(<span class='it'>081-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>An order of Keitel’s OKW provided that escaped officers and
non-working non-commissioned officers other than Americans
and British were to be turned over to the SIPO and SD upon recapture.
The SIPO and SD, upon instructions from their chief,
would then transport the men to the Mauthausen concentration
camp under operation “Kugel” (<span class='it'>L-158</span>). Such prisoners were
executed at Mauthausen upon arrival (<span class='it'>2285-PS</span>). Americans
and British who were recaptured might be turned over to the
SIPO and SD, upon decision of the “W.Kdos” from the OKW/o.i.c.
(<span class='it'>L-158</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>Killing of Hostages.</span> Keitel’s criminal activities are shown
by the following two documents. On 16 December 1941 he signed
an order stating that uprisings among German troops in occupied
territories must be considered as inspired by a communist
conspiracy, and that the death of one German soldier must mean
death for fifty or one hundred communists. (<span class='it'>829-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Keitel also signed an order (received by the OKH on 1 October
1941) specifying that hostages should be well known, and that
they should come from Nationalist, Democrat, or Communist political
factions. After each act of sabotage hostages belonging
to the saboteur’s group should be shot. (<span class='it'>1590-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(5) <span class='it'>Plunder of public and private property.</span> The looting of
cultural property was carried on chiefly under Rosenberg by the
<span class='it'>Einsatzstab Rosenberg</span>, an organization established for that purpose.
In the West he was to act in his capacity as Reichsleiter,
and in the East in his capacity as Reichsminister. Keitel’s OKW
cooperated with Rosenberg, and directions for carrying out the
order were to be issued by the Chief of the OKW in agreement
with Rosenberg (<span class='it'>149-PS</span>). Keitel ordered the military authorities
to cooperate in this program (<span class='it'>137-PS</span>; <span class='it'>138-PS</span>). A memorandum
of 17 May 1944 in the Rosenberg Ministry states that
the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> was one of the principal agencies engaged in removing
treasures from Russia. (<span class='it'>1107-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Keitel was also responsible for the removal of machine tools,
foodstuffs, and other materials from occupied territories. (<span class='it'>1161-PS</span>;
<span class='it'>743-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(6) <span class='it'>The exaction of collective penalties.</span> Collective penalties
<span class='pageno' title='538' id='Page_538'></span>
were exacted from the population for acts of individuals for
which it could not be held responsible. Keitel advocated such
measures. This appears from correspondence on acts of sabotage
in the shipbuilding yards. (<span class='it'>C-48</span>; <span class='it'>870-PS</span>; <span class='it'>871-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(7) <span class='it'>Germanization of Occupied Territories.</span> On 16 July 1941
Keitel was present at a meeting with Hitler where the policy was
announced of exploiting occupied Russian territory and making
it part of the Reich. (<span class='it'>L-221</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In order to promote a racially valuable German heritage an
order signed by Hitler, Lammers, and Keitel provides for payment
of subsidies to Norwegian or Dutch women who had borne
children of German soldiers. The Chief of OKW was authorized
to extend its application to other occupied territories. (<span class='it'>2926-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(8) <span class='it'>Persecution of minorities.</span> Keitel’s responsibility for the
persecution of minorities in Germany appears from the fact that,
with Hitler, Goering, and Lammers, he signed a decree on 7 October
1939 which provided that the harmful influence of foreigners
must be eliminated from Germany; that Germans could be resettled
by the Reichsfuehrer SS; and that the Reichsfuehrer SS
could perform “all necessary general and administrative measures”
to discharge this duty. (<span class='it'>686-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Keitel’s responsibility for the criminal treatment of Jews is
apparent from his own statement that the struggle against Bolshevism
necessitated a ruthless proceeding against the Jews; the
<span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> was not to use them for any service, but they could
be placed in labor columns under German supervision. (<span class='it'>878-PS</span>)</p>

<h3>F. <span class='it'>JOINT RESPONSIBILITY OF KEITEL AND JODL FOR PLANNING AND LAUNCHING WARS OF AGGRESSION, AND FOR THE LYNCHING OF ALLIED AIRMEN.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Aggression against Austria.</span> In June of 1937 von Blomberg
ordered preparations for “Case Otto”—armed intervention
in Austria in event of a Hapsburg restoration (<span class='it'>C-175</span>). New
plans were made in 1938 under the same name. German policy in
1938 was to eliminate Austria and Czechoslovakia, and there was
a campaign to undermine Austria’s will to resist, by pressure on
the government, by propaganda, and by fifth column activity.
(<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Keitel was present at Berchtesgaden when Schuschnigg visited
Hitler there in February 1938. Schuschnigg was subjected to
political and military pressure, which resulted in such concessions
to the Nazis as the reorganization of the Austrian cabinet
<span class='pageno' title='539' id='Page_539'></span>
(<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>). Keitel and Jodl and Canaris were instructed to keep
up the military pressure against Austria by simulating military
measures until 15 February. (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>) The OKW submitted
proposals to Hitler regarding the Austrian campaign; these included
suggestions of false rumors and broadcasts. A note in
Jodl’s handwriting states that Hitler approved the memorandum
by telephone and that Canaris was informed. (<span class='it'>1775-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler ordered preparation of “Case Otto”—mobilization of
army units and air forces (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>). Hitler’s directive for “Case
Otto” was initialled by Keitel and Jodl. Jodl issued supplementary
instructions (<span class='it'>C-102</span>; <span class='it'>C-103</span>). Jodl initialled Hitler’s order
for the invasion of Austria. (<span class='it'>C-182</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>The Execution of the plan to invade Czechoslovakia.</span> On
21 April 1938 Hitler and Keitel met and discussed plans for the
taking of Czechoslovakia. They considered a military attack
after a period of diplomatic friction, or as the result of a created
incident, such as the assassination of the German ambassador at
Prague. (<span class='it'>388-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the invasion of Austria, <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> planning was devoted
to “Case Green,” the operation against Czechoslovakia
(<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>). Case Green was first drafted in 1937, when it was
thought that a “probable warlike eventuality” would be “war on
two fronts with the center of gravity in the southeast.” A surprise
attack on Czechoslovakia was considered possible (<span class='it'>C-175</span>).
Through the late spring and summer of 1938 Case Green was revised
and modified. The memoranda and correspondence are frequently
signed or initialled by Keitel, and it is clear that he knew
of Hitler’s intention to use force against Czechoslovakia and
made the plans to carry out that intention. (<span class='it'>388-PS</span>; <span class='it'>1780-PS</span>;
<span class='it'>2353-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were many meetings on Case Green in September 1938,
some with Hitler, some with Keitel and Jodl. The timing of troop
movements was discussed; the question of advance notice to
OKH; preparations of railroads and fortifications; even propaganda
to counteract the anticipated violations of International
Law which the invasion would entail (<span class='it'>388-PS</span>; <span class='it'>1780-PS</span>; <span class='it'>C-2</span>).
Assistance was given by OKH to the Sudeten German Free Corps,
an auxiliary military organization which operated under Henlein
to create disorder in Czechoslovakia. (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>; <span class='it'>388-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In October 1938 Hitler addressed to the OKW four specific
questions about the time and the forces that would be required to
break Czech resistance in Bohemia and Moravia, and Keitel submitted
the answers prepared by the OKH and Luftwaffe (<span class='it'>388-PS</span>).
<span class='pageno' title='540' id='Page_540'></span>
On 21 October 1938 Hitler signed an order (and Keitel
initialled it) requiring the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> to make preparations to
take the remainder of Czechoslovakia. (<span class='it'>C-136</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two months later Keitel issued a supplement to this order, stating
that on the order of the Fuehrer preparations for the liquidation
of Czechoslovakia were to continue, and stressing the importance
of having the attack well camouflaged and unwarlike
in appearance. (<span class='it'>C-138</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Keitel was present at the interview between Hitler and
Hacha at the Reich Chancellery on 15 March 1939, when the
Czech representatives delivered their country to Hitler, after
hours of duress, which included the threat of immediate bombing
of Prague. (<span class='it'>2798-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2943-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Aggression against Poland.</span> On 25 March 1939—four days
after Ribbentrop pressed new demands for Danzig on the Polish
Ambassador—Hitler told von Brauchitsch, Commander-in-chief
of the Army, that he did not intend to solve the Polish question
by force for the time being but requested that plans for that
operation be developed. (<span class='it'>R-100</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 3 April 1939 Keitel, as Chief of the High Command of the
Armed Forces, reissued over his signature the directive for the
Uniform Preparation for War by the Armed Forces for 1939/40.
The directive, noting that the basic principles for the sections on
“Frontier Defense” and “Danzig” remained unaltered, stated that
Hitler had added the following directives to “Fall Weiss”:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“1. Preparations must be made in such a way that the operation
can be carried out at any time from <span class='it'>1.9.39</span> onwards.</p>

<p>“2. The High Command of the Armed Forces has been directed
to draw up a precise timetable for “Fall Weiss” and
to arrange by conferences the synchronized timings between
the three branches of the Armed Forces.</p>

<p>“3. The plans of the branches of the Armed Forces and the
details for the timetable must be submitted to the OKW by
1.5.39.” (<span class='it'>C-120</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>It is noteworthy that, even in April of 1939, the tentative timetable
called for the invasion of Poland to be carried out at any
time from 1 September 1939 onwards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About a week later, an order signed by Hitler was circulated
to the highest commands of the Army, Navy and Air Force. This
confirmed Keitel’s directive to prepare for three eventualities:
“Frontier Defense”, “Fall Weiss”, and the Annexation of Danzig.
Annex II contained further instructions for “Fall Weiss”. In the
first paragraph, headed “Political Hypotheses and Aims”, it was
<span class='pageno' title='541' id='Page_541'></span>
stated that should Poland adopt a threatening attitude toward
Germany, a “final settlement” would be necessary <span class='it'>notwithstanding
the pact with Poland</span>. “The aim is then to destroy Polish
military strength .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was further stated that the Free State of Danzig would be
incorporated into Germany at the outbreak of the conflict, at the
latest. The directive continued: “Policy aims at limiting the war
to Poland, and this is considered possible in view of the internal
crisis in France and British restraint as a result of this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The general political background against which the Armed
Forces were to work having thus been set down, the later paragraphs
outlined the tasks and operational objectives of the three
branches of the Armed Forces. It was also decreed that a “camouflaged
or open (‘general’ added in ink) mobilization will not be
ordered before D-Day 1 at the latest possible moment”, and
further that the “preparations for the opening of operations are
to be made in such a way that—without waiting for the planned
assembly of mobilized units—positions can be taken up immediately
by the first available troops.” (<span class='it'>C-120</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 10 May an order signed by Hitler promulgated his instructions
for the seizure of economic installations in Poland and directed
the commanders-in-chief of the three branches of the armed
forces to report by 1 August 1939 on the measures taken in consequence
of these instructions. (<span class='it'>C-120</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 23 May 1939 Hitler called a meeting of his military leaders
at the Reich Chancellery. Keitel was at the meeting; Jodl was
not, but Warlimont (also from the Planning Department of
OKW) was. Hitler announced the necessity of a war against
Poland, not over Danzig, but in order to acquire living space in
the East. He recognized the possibility that this would provoke
a war against France and England, but the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> was instructed
to prepare detailed plans. (<span class='it'>L-79</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>A directive dated 22 June 1939, signed by Keitel as Chief of
the OKW, indicates an advanced stage of preparation. On the
basis of particulars already available from the Navy, Army, and
Air Force, he stated, he had submitted to Hitler a “preliminary
timetable” for “Fall Weiss.” The Fuehrer was reported to be in
substantial agreement with the intentions submitted by the three
branches; he had also made suggestions with regard to the need
to camouflage the scheduled maneuvers “in order not to disquiet
the population,” and had commented on the disposition of
an SS Artillery Regiment. (<span class='it'>C-126</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two days later, Keitel issued instructions for further study
<span class='pageno' title='542' id='Page_542'></span>
on two specific problems: the capture, in undamaged condition,
of bridges over the Vistula; and the possible adverse effect of
Navy mining in Danzig Bay on the element of surprise in the
Army’s attack against the bridge at Dirschau, southeast of Danzig.
(<span class='it'>C-120</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 22 August 1939, Hitler called together at Obersalzberg the
Supreme Commanders of the three branches of the armed forces,
as well as the lower ranking Commanding Generals (<span class='it'>Oberbefehlshaber</span>),
and announced his decision to attack Poland near dawn
on 26 August. Keitel was at this meeting. (<span class='it'>L-3</span>; <span class='it'>798-PS</span>; <span class='it'>1014-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three documents reporting this meeting have been uncovered:
the text of one, <span class='it'>L-3</span>, overlaps the contents of the other two,
<span class='it'>798-PS</span> and <span class='it'>1014-PS</span>; the latter two appear to be complementary,
<span class='it'>798-PS</span> being a record of a morning speech, and <span class='it'>1014-PS</span> of an
afternoon speech. Violent and abusive language appears in
both <span class='it'>L-3</span> and <span class='it'>798-PS</span>. That Hitler made, at a minimum, the following
points, appears from all of them:</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. The decision to attack Poland was made last spring. (<span class='it'>L-3</span>;
<span class='it'>798-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. The aim of the war in Poland is to destroy the Polish armed
forces, rather than to reach a fixed line. (<span class='it'>L-3</span>; <span class='it'>1014-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>3. The attack will start early Saturday morning, 26 August
(<span class='it'>L-3</span>; <span class='it'>1014-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>4. A spurious cause for starting the war will be devised by
German propaganda. It is a matter of indifference whether it is
plausible or not. The world will not question the victor (<span class='it'>L-3</span>;
<span class='it'>1014-PS</span>). The text in <span class='it'>L-3</span> further describes the pretext to be
used to start the war: “I’ll let a couple of companies, dressed in
Polish uniforms, make an assault in Upper Silesia or in the Protectorate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A handwritten entry in the diary of Jodl, at that time Chief
of the Operations Department of the OKW, confirms that the
time for the attack on Poland had been fixed for 0430 on 26
August 1939. (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>Aggression against Norway and Denmark.</span> On or about
12 September 1939 Hitler ordered the OKW to start preparations
for the occupation of Norwegian bases early in 1940. (<span class='it'>1546-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The possibility of using Quisling was discussed with Hitler on
12 December 1939, in a conference at which Raeder, Keitel, and
Jodl were present. Hitler agreed with Raeder’s suggestion that,
if he was favorably impressed with Quisling, the OKW should
<span class='pageno' title='543' id='Page_543'></span>
be authorized to prepare for the occupation either with Quisling’s
assistance, or by force. (<span class='it'>C-64</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In January of 1940 the Navy was ordered to concentrate
barges for the invasion, and further preparations were to be conducted
under the code name “<span class='it'>Weserubung</span>” (<span class='it'>C-63</span>). The general
directive for the invasion was issued by Hitler on 1 March 1940.
(<span class='it'>C-174</span>; <span class='it'>1809-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(5) <span class='it'>Aggression against Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.</span>
At a conference with Hitler on 23 May 1939 it was determined
that the occupation of the Low Countries was necessary
to the successful conduct of the war against England. A small
planning staff was formed at OKW with responsibility for further
planning of the invasion, and complete secrecy was invoked.
Keitel was at this meeting. (<span class='it'>L-79</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 9 October 1939 it was stated in a general directive for the
conduct of the war in the West that the invasion should be started
soon, in order to protect the Ruhr and to provide air bases for use
against England. A copy of this directive was distributed to
OKW. (<span class='it'>L-52</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In October and November of 1939 a number of military orders
was issued concerning the invasion of the Low Countries—“Fall
Gelb”. Questions of how far the troops should advance under
the plan were clarified (<span class='it'>C-62</span>; <span class='it'>440-PS</span>). Instructions were
issued concerning the deployment of troops, communications systems,
crossing of the borders, and the administration and pacification
of the countries to be taken (<span class='it'>2329-PS</span>). Provisions were
made for special operations by the 7th Flieger Division near the
Belgian-French border. (<span class='it'>C-10</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Between 7 November 1939 and 9 May 1940 seventeen orders
were issued setting and postponing the day for starting operations.
These delays were caused by the weather. One of the
orders, dated 11 January 1940, shows that all the others were
concerned with the action against the Low Countries, and that
the 7th Flieger Division (see <span class='it'>C-10</span>) was involved. All these orders
were signed either by Keitel or Jodl. (<span class='it'>C-72</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The development of the plans, and the various questions which
came up for consideration are shown in the entries in Jodl’s
diary. At one point the Foreign Office did not regard the prepared
justification for the attack as satisfactory, but Jodl thought
it was sufficient. His diary shows the existence of the plan
against the Low Countries and the steps taken to put it into
execution. (<span class='it'>1809-PS</span>)
<span class='pageno' title='544' id='Page_544'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(6) <span class='it'>Aggression against Greece and Yugoslavia.</span> On 12 November
1940 Hitler issued orders to the Army to prepare for the
occupation of the Greek mainland (<span class='it'>444-PS</span>). On 13 December
1940 a Hitler order stated that the invasion of Greece was
planned and would start as soon as the weather became favorable.
The composition of combat teams and their routes of march were
given. When the Greek operation was concluded, the mass of the
troops involved were to be employed for a new task. This order
was distributed to the OKW, as well as to the three armed services.
(<span class='it'>1541-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 11 January 1941 Hitler ordered preparation for armed intervention
in Albania, to assist the Italians against Greece. The
order was initialled by Keitel and Jodl (<span class='it'>448-PS</span>). On 20 January
1941 Jodl reported, in notes of a meeting between Hitler
and Mussolini, that Hitler stated that one of the purposes of German
troop concentrations in Rumania was for use in his plan for
the operation against Greece. This was four months prior to the
attack. (<span class='it'>C-134</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 19 February 1941 an OKW order signed by Warlimont gave
decisions for carrying out the Greek campaign, providing that
pontoon building would commence on 26 February, and that the
Danube would be crossed on 2 March. (<span class='it'>C-59</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 18 March 1941 Raeder, in the presence of Keitel and Jodl,
asked for confirmation that the whole of Greece would have to be
occupied even in the event of a peaceful settlement, and Hitler
replied that complete occupation was a prerequisite to any settlement.
(<span class='it'>C-167</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a meeting on 27 March 1941, attended by both Keitel and
Jodl, Hitler outlined the proposed operations against Yugoslavia
and Greece. The actual plan for military operations, Directive
No. 25, was issued on the same day. (<span class='it'>1746-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(7) <span class='it'>Aggression against the U.S.S.R.</span> On 12 November 1940
Hitler issued a directive in which, among other things, it was
stated that preparations for the East already verbally ordered
should be continued, regardless of the outcome of current political
discussions for the clarification of Russia’s attitude. The directive
was initialled by Jodl. (<span class='it'>444-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The original directive for preparation of the attack on Russia—case
“Barbarossa”—was signed by Hitler on 18 December 1940
and initialled by Keitel and Jodl (<span class='it'>446-PS</span>). On 3 February 1941
Hitler held a meeting to discuss the intended invasion. Keitel
and Jodl were both present (<span class='it'>872-PS</span>). On 1 March 1941 an OKW
map was prepared to show the intended division of occupied
<span class='pageno' title='545' id='Page_545'></span>
Russian territory. The distribution list shows that Keitel and
Jodl received copies. (<span class='it'>1642-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In March of 1941 Keitel wrote to Reich Minister Todt to give
him detailed instructions about camouflaging the coming invasion.
The letter was initialled by Jodl. (<span class='it'>874-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 13 March 1941 Keitel issued an operational supplement to
Hitler’s Barbarossa order (<span class='it'>446-PS</span>). This order defined the area
of operations and established the relationship between political
and military officers in those areas (<span class='it'>447-PS</span>). On 1 June 1941
there was issued, with Hitler’s approval, a timetable for the invasion,
showing the disposition and missions of the Army, Navy,
and Air Force. This paper was signed by Keitel (<span class='it'>C-39</span>). On 14
June 1941 an order was issued for final reports on Barbarossa to
be made in Berlin by Army, Navy, and Air Commanders. (<span class='it'>C-78</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the foregoing preparations were being made, planning
for the production of armaments and supplies was being conducted
by one of Keitel’s subordinates, General Thomas, Chief of
the <span class='it'>Wirtschaft Ruestungsamt</span> in OKW. (<span class='it'>2353-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>By a Fuehrer order dated 20 April 1941 Rosenberg was appointed
“Deputy for a Centralized Treatment of Problems concerning
the Eastern Territories”. Jodl and Warlimont were appointed
Keitel’s representatives with the Rosenberg office
(<span class='it'>865-PS</span>). A preliminary report by Rosenberg on his work up
to the time of the invasion mentions Keitel and Jodl as having
consulted and worked with him in those preparations. (<span class='it'>1039-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>A memorandum written by General Thomas on 20 June 1941
states that Keitel had confirmed to him Hitler’s policy on raw
materials—that it took less manpower to seize territories containing
raw materials, than it did to make synthetic substitutes.
(<span class='it'>1456-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(8) <span class='it'>War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity;—Crimes
against Military Personnel—Lynching of Allied Airmen.</span> On 21
May 1944 Keitel received a note from WFSt to the effect that
Hitler had decided that enemy fliers who had been forced down
should be shot without court-martial, if they had engaged in
“acts of terror”. Keitel wrote on the note “Please arrange for
order to be drafted. K”. (<span class='it'>731-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>By 4 June 1944 Jodl and Warlimont were ready to go ahead
with formulating the plans. Goering was to be asked what actions
of enemy fliers should be punishable by death; the Airmen’s
Reception Camp at Oberursel was to be told which fliers should
be delivered to the SD; and the Foreign Office was to be kept
advised. (<span class='it'>737-PS</span>)
<span class='pageno' title='546' id='Page_546'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>At subsequent conferences Keitel and Jodl raised questions
about the difficulty of establishing general rules in such a matter.
The “Acts of Terror” were:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>1.</span><p class='listPara'>Low level attacks on civilians.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 17 June 1944 Keitel wrote to the Foreign Office to ask
their approval of the proposed measure and the agreed definition
of “Acts of Terror” (<span class='it'>730-PS</span>). On the same day Keitel
wrote to Goering to ask for his approval of the definitions of
“Acts of Terror”, and also to ask that he give verbal instructions
to the Commandant of the camp at Oberursel to hand over fliers
guilty of such acts to the SD. Both Keitel and Jodl initialled this
letter (<span class='it'>729-PS</span>). Goering replied that fliers not guilty of acts
of terror must be protected, and suggested that such matters be
handled by the courts. (<span class='it'>732-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>A draft of a Foreign Office letter dated 20 June 1944 expresses
misgivings about the Geneva Convention, and concern about the
publicity that would be involved. (<span class='it'>728-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 26 June 1944 Goering’s adjutant telephoned the WFSt to
say that Goering agreed to the procedures suggested. (<span class='it'>733-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 29 June Warlimont was informed that Ribbentrop had approved
the Foreign Office draft (<span class='it'>728-PS</span>), but wished to obtain
Hitler’s approval before communicating his own final written
approval to Keitel. (<span class='it'>740-PS</span>)</p>

<h3>B. <span class='it'>FUNCTIONS OF JODL’S POSITIONS.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Jodl’s most important office was that of Chief of the Operations
Staff (<span class='it'>Wehrmachtsfuehrungstab</span>) in OKW. In this capacity he
was directly subordinate to Keitel and equal in status to other
departmental chiefs in OKW. However, insofar as the planning
and conduct of military affairs are concerned, Jodl and his staff
were more influential than the other departments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The OKW Operations Staff was also divided into sections. Of
these the most important was the “National Defense” section, of
which Warlimont was chief. He was primarily concerned with
<span class='pageno' title='566' id='Page_566'></span>
the development of strategic questions. From 1941 onwards
Warlimont, though charged with the same duties, was known
as Deputy Chief of the OKW Operations Staff. (<span class='it'>3707-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jodl drafted many directives for Hitler to sign, for the preparation
of military operations and plans of deployment, and for
the possible initiation and commencement of military measures
relating to matters of organization, operations, or “war-economics.”
While in a theater of operations, Jodl would report
twice daily to Hitler about operations, and then prepare the
Fuehrer directives. There was direct contact between Hitler and
Jodl, though Keitel was kept informed of what passed between
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to certain ministerial functions, the OKW was Hitler’s
military staff. Its most important duty was the development
of strategic and operational plans. Such plans were worked
out by the OKW Operations Staff in broad outline, and then in
more detail by the Commanders and Chiefs of Staffs of the
Army, Navy, and Air Force. After Hitler had approved the plans
they were transmitted by the OKW to the appropriate military
authorities (<span class='it'>3705-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3702-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3707-PS</span>).</p>

<h3>C. <span class='it'>JODL’S PART IN THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT CRIMES AGAINST PEACE.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Jodl’s loyalty to the Nazi party doctrine is evident in a speech
he delivered on 7 November 1943. He spoke of the National Socialist
Movement and its struggle for internal power as the preparation
for liberation from the Treaty of Versailles. (<span class='it'>L-172)
</span>
He also stated, in a speech on the occasion of the attempted
assassination of Hitler, that his aims had been in general agreement
with the aims of the party. (<span class='it'>1808-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the sixth meeting of the Working Committee of the Reich
Defense Council on 7 February 1934 Jodl pointed out that the
practical execution of the preparations for mobilization, which
had been ordered by the Army and the highest Reich authorities,
were making a considerable enlargement of personnel necessary.
He suggested, however, that this enlargement of personnel
ought not to result in “the disquieting of foreign countries
through conspicuous mobilization measures.” (<span class='it'>EC-405</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the presence of Jodl, Generalmajor Keitel pointed out at
the eleventh meeting that the mobilization year was to begin on
1 April and to end on 31 March of the following year. A “Mobilization
Book for Civilian Agencies” was to be issued for the first
time on 1 April 1936. Keitel said that this day, to the extent
<span class='pageno' title='567' id='Page_567'></span>
possible, should find the nation ready and prepared. He declared
that, according to the will of the Fuehrer, the economic management
of the country should put the enhancement of military
capacity deliberately above all other national tasks. It was the
function of all members of the Reich Defense Council, he emphasized,
to use all available resources economically and to ask for
only such funds and raw materials that were absolutely and exclusively
needed for the defense of the Reich. Colonel Jodl said
that the Mobilization Book for the Civilian Departments constituted
the unified basis for the carrying out of mobilization outside
of the Army (<span class='it'>EC-406</span>).</p>

<h3>D. <span class='it'>JODL’S PART IN PLANNING AND LAUNCHING WARS OF AGGRESSION.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>(<span class='it'>See “F,” 1 through 7, in Section 4 of this Chapter on Keitel,
where the joint responsibility of Keitel and Jodl for these activities
is discussed.</span>)</span></p>

<h3>E. <span class='it'>JODL’S PART IN THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT WAR CRIMES AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Murder and ill treatment of civilian population in occupied,
territories and on the high seas.</span> Jodl ordered the forcible evacuation
of all persons in a northern district of Norway, and the
burning of all their dwellings. This was to be done so that the inhabitants
of that area could not help the Russians (<span class='it'>754-PS</span>).
Shortly thereafter an evacuation took place in Finnmark County
in northern Norway, in the course of which 30,000 houses were
damaged. (<span class='it'>1800-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jodl was aware that in 1942 there were continual arrests in
Belgrade, and that from fifteen to thirty followers of Mihalovic
were shot every day. (<span class='it'>1383-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jodl initialled an order signed for Hitler by Keitel, which provided
that enemy civilians guilty of offenses against German
troops should be killed without a military trial, and that punishment
could be waived in the case of German soldiers who committed
offenses against enemy civilians. (<span class='it'>886-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg was appointed by Hitler on 20 April 1941 “Deputy
for a Centralized Treatment of Problems concerning the Eastern
Territories.” The highest Reich authorities were to cooperate
fully, and Keitel was asked to designate a representative of
OKW to sit with Rosenberg. Jodl was appointed as Keitel’s
representative with Warlimont as his deputy, and Keitel wrote
<span class='pageno' title='568' id='Page_568'></span>
to Rosenberg on 25 April 1941 that Jodl and Warlimont would
be the OKW representatives. (<span class='it'>865-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Responsibility for crimes committed under Rosenberg’s authority
thus attach to Jodl as well. In this connection reference is
made to Section 7 of this chapter on Rosenberg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Deportation of civilian populations of and in Occupied
Territories for slave labor and for other purposes.</span> Jodl knew
of the deportation of workers, for he once told Hitler that the
military commander of France had reported that over 220,000
workers had been deported into the Reich in the past six months.
(<span class='it'>1383-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Murder and ill treatment of prisoners of war, and of
other members of the Armed Forces of the countries with whom
Germany was at war and of persons on the high seas.</span> On 18
October 1942 Hitler ordered that commando troops, even if in
uniform, should be killed, not only in battle, but in flight or while
attempting to surrender. This order was issued by Jodl’s department.
(<span class='it'>498-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>A supplementary explanation of the commando order, signed
by Hitler, was distributed to commanding officers only, with a
covering memorandum dated 19 October 1942, signed by Jodl
(<span class='it'>503-PS</span>). Several cases are known in which the order was carried
out. (<span class='it'>508-PS</span>; <span class='it'>509-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three specific instances were mentioned by the G-3 of the C in
C, Norway, where captured members of sabotage units were
executed after interrogations which resulted in valuable intelligence.
These occurred at Gloafjord, Drontheim, and at
Stavanger. (<span class='it'>512-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 23 June 1944 C in C West requested instructions re-defining
the scope of the commando order. In view of the extensive
landings in Normandy, it had become difficult to decide which
paratroops should be considered sabotage troops under the terms
of the order, and which should be considered as engaged in
normal combat operations. The question was answered by an
order of 25 June 1944, one copy of which was signed by Keitel, reaffirming
the full force of the original order. (<span class='it'>531-PS</span>; <span class='it'>551-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>When allied fliers were forced to land in Germany, they were
sometimes killed by the civilian population. The police had orders
not to protect the fliers, nor to punish civilians for lynching them.
A proposal was considered to order the shooting without court-martial
of enemy airmen who had been forced down after engaging
in specified “acts of terror.” It is not certain that the
<span class='pageno' title='569' id='Page_569'></span>
order was ever issued, but it is certain that Keitel and Jodl knew
of the lynchings, did nothing to prevent them and in fact considered
giving them official justification.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>See also “F” at the end of Section 4 of this Chapter on Keitel,
where the joint responsibility of Keitel and Jodl for the lynching
of Allied airmen is discussed.</span>)</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg575a'>6. ERNST KALTENBRUNNER</h2>

<h3>A. <span class='it'>KALTENBRUNNER ENTERED THE NATIONAL SOCIALIST MOVEMENT IN ITS EARLY STAGES, AND SUPPORTED IT, AND WAS A LEADER IN IT UNTIL THE END.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Ernst Kaltenbrunner was born on 4 October 1903 at Ried on
Inn (near Braunau) Austria. He spent his youth in Hitler’s
native district. Later he moved to Linz, where he attended the
State <span class='it'>Realgymnasium</span>. He studied law and obtained a law degree
in 1926. He spent the first year as apprentice lawyer at Linze-on-Danube
and then worked as a lawyer-candidate, first at Salzburg
and after 1928 at Linz (<span class='it'>2938-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kaltenbrunner joined the Nazi Party and the SS in Austria in
1932. Prior to 1933 he was the District speaker (<span class='it'>Gauredner</span>)
and legal counsellor (<span class='it'>Rechtsberater</span>) of the SS division (<span class='it'>Abschnitt</span>)
VIII. After 1933 he was the fuehrer of regiment
(<span class='it'>Standarte</span>) 37 and later of the SS division VIII (<span class='it'>2892-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In January 1934 Kaltenbrunner was jailed by the Dollfuss
government on account of his Nazi views, and sent with other
leading National Socialists into the concentration camp Kaisersteinbruch.
<span class='pageno' title='576' id='Page_576'></span>
He is said to have started and led a hunger strike
of the prisoners and thereby to have forced the government to
dismiss 490 National Socialist prisoners. In the following year
he was jailed again because of suspicion of High Treason and
committed to the military court at Wels (Upper Danube). After
an investigation of many months the accusation of High Treason
was dropped, but he was condemned to six months’ imprisonment
for conspiracy. His right to practice law was suspended
because of his Nazi activities (<span class='it'>2938-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the Spring of 1935 Kaltenbrunner was the leader of the
Austrian SS. In the magazine of the SIPO and SD, issue of
15 May 1943, it is stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It redounds to his credit that in this important position he
succeeded through energetic leadership in maintaining the
unity of the Austrian SS, which he had built up, in spite of
all persecution, and succeeded in committing it successfully
at the right moment. After the annexation, in which the SS
was a decisive factor, he was appointed State Secretary for
Security Matters on 11 March 1938 in the new National-Socialist
cabinet of Seyss-Inquart. A few hours later he
was able to report to Reichsfuehrer SS Heinrich Himmler,
who had landed at Aspern, the Vienna airport, on 12 March
1938, 3 a. m., as the first National Socialist leader, that the
Movement had achieved a complete victory and that ‘The
SS is in formation and awaiting further orders.’ ” (<span class='it'>2938-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler promoted Kaltenbrunner on the date of the Anschluss to
the rank of SS Brigadefuehrer and leader of the SS <span class='it'>Oberabschnitt</span>
Donau. On 11 September 1938 he was promoted to the
rank of SS Gruppenfuehrer. During the liquidation of the Austrian
national government and the reorganization of Austria
into Alps and Danube Districts, he was appointed Higher SS and
Police Leader to the governors of Vienna, Lower Danube, and
Upper Danube, in Corps Area (<span class='it'>Wehrkreis</span>) XVII, and in April
1941 was promoted to Major General of the Police (<span class='it'>2938-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 30 January 1943 Kaltenbrunner was appointed Chief of
the Security Police and SD (RSHA), succeeding Heydrich, who
had been assassinated in Prague in June 1942. Kaltenbrunner
held this position until the end of the war (<span class='it'>2644-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 4 October 1943 at Pozen, Poland, in a speech delivered to
Gruppenfuehrers of the SS, Himmler made special reference to
“our comrade Obergruppenfuehrer Kaltenbrunner, who has succeeded
our fallen friend Heydrich” (<span class='it'>1919-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 9 December 1944 the decoration known as the Knight’s
Cross of the War Merit, Cross with Swords, was given to SS
<span class='pageno' title='577' id='Page_577'></span>
Obergruppenfuehrer and General of the Police Dr. Ernst Kaltenbrunner,
Chief of the Security Police and the SD (<span class='it'>2770-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition he held the Golden insignia of Honor and the <span class='it'>Blutorden</span>.
He was a member of the Reichstag after the 9th election
period 1938 (<span class='it'>2892-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toward the end of the war, Kaltenbrunner’s power increased
greatly, especially after the attack on Hitler of 20 July 1944.
He gained direct access to Hitler. He was very friendly with
Fegelein and his wife, who was the sister of Eva Braun. So
powerful had Kaltenbrunner become toward the end that even
Himmler feared him. On 13 April 1945 the chief of the German
foreign intelligence service, Schellenberg, asked Himmler to
receive the representative of the Jewish World Congress, Mr.
Storsch, from Stockholm, and Himmler said,</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“But how am I going to do that in regard to Kaltenbrunner?
I shall then be completely at his mercy!” (<span class='it'>2990-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<h3>B. <span class='it'>DURING KALTENBRUNNER’S TERM IN OFFICE AS CHIEF OF THE SECURITY POLICE AND SD, NUMEROUS AND VAST CRIMES WERE COMMITTED BY THE SIPO AND SD IN THE COURSE OF OFFICIAL DUTIES.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>As Chief of the Security Police after 30 January 1943, Kaltenbrunner
was the head of the RSHA and the regional offices
of the Gestapo, SD, and Kripo. Directly under Kaltenbrunner
were the Chiefs of the main offices of the RSHA, including Amt
III (the SD), Amt IV (the Gestapo), Amt V (the Kripo), and
Amt VI (the SD in foreign intelligence) (<span class='it'>L-219</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kaltenbrunner had direct responsibility over the offices of the
RSHA. All important matters had to be referred to him or had
to be handled under general or special authority granted by him
to office chiefs.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“All decisions of principal character are signed by the Chief
of the Security Police personally. An office chief has only
the authority to sign ‘acting for’ and a chairman ‘by order of’
if the subjects treated in the respective decrees fit into the
general laid-down principles according to the plan of distribution
of authority. In case of doubt it was the duty to get
the question cleared up by reporting it to the Chief of Security
Police and SD.” (<span class='it'>L-34</span>)</p>

<p>“To my knowledge no chief of office or any of the officials of
the RSHA, authorized to sign, had the right to sign in any
principal affairs of particular political significance without
consent of the Chief of the Security Police—not even during
<span class='pageno' title='578' id='Page_578'></span>
his temporary absence. From my own experience I can furthermore
declare that the chief of Amt IV, Mueller, particularly
was very hesitant in signing documents concerning
questions of general nature and in some cases of greater importance,
and that he put aside events of such nature in most
cases for the return of the Chief of the Security Police,
whereby often much time was lost.” (<span class='it'>L-50</span>).</p>

</div>

<p>Schellenberg, the Chief of Amt VI of the RSHA, has stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I know of no limitation placed on Kaltenbrunner’s authority
as Chief of the Security Police and SD (RSHA). He
promptly entered upon the duties of the office and assumed
direct charge of the office and control over the Amts * * *
He made it very clear in his official relations with all of us
who were his <span class='it'>Amt</span> Chiefs that he was the head of the office
exercising full executive powers and deciding all matters of
policy. He permitted us to issue directives within the organization
in our own names pursuant to fixed policies established
by him, but all important matters had to be submitted
to him whether he signed them or we signed them. He was
constantly informed of all matters of importance which went
on in the entire organization. (<span class='it'>2939-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>During Kaltenbrunner’s term in office as Chief of the Security
Police and SD, the following crimes were committed by the SIPO
and SD pursuant to policy established by the RSHA or orders
issued out of the RSHA for all of which he was responsible by
virtue of his office.</p>

<h3>C. <span class='it'>KALTENBRUNNER HAD DIRECT KNOWLEDGE OF AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE COMMISSION OF MANY SPECIFIC CRIMES.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Kaltenbrunner was fully cognizant of conditions in concentration
camps and of the fact that concentration camps were
used for slave labor and mass murder.</span> Mauthausen concentration
camp was established in Austria while Kaltenbrunner was
the Higher SS and Police Leader for Austria, and was frequently
visited by Kaltenbrunner before he was appointed Chief of the
Security Police and SD (<span class='it'>L-51</span>). On the occasion of one such visit
<span class='pageno' title='580' id='Page_580'></span>
in 1942, Kaltenbrunner personally observed the gas chamber in
operation (<span class='it'>2753-PS</span>). After he became Chief of the Security
Police and SD, Kaltenbrunner visited Mauthausen concentration
camp but with less frequency (<span class='it'>L-51</span>). On one occasion he made
an inspection of the camp grounds with Himmler and had his
photograph taken during the course of the inspection (<span class='it'>2641-PS</span>).
After a visit to Mauthausen in 1944 Kaltenbrunner reported to
his <span class='it'>Amt</span> Chiefs with pride that he had helped to build up Mauthausen
when he was Higher SS and Police Leader in Austria and
that the camp was engaged in valuable armament work (<span class='it'>2990-PS</span>).
Mauthausen concentration camp was classified by Heydrich
in January 1941 in category III, a camp for the most heavily
accused prisoners and for asocial prisoners who were considered
incapable of being reformed (<span class='it'>1063-A-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were frequent conferences between the RSHA and
executives of the SS <span class='it'>Wirtschaft</span> and <span class='it'>Verwaltungshauptamt</span> who
had charge of the internal administration of concentration camps.
The affidavit of Rudolf Mildner states with respect to these conferences:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“SS Obergruppenfuehrer Dr. Kaltenbrunner attended personally
conferences with SS Obergruppenfuehrer Pohl, Chief
of the SS <span class='it'>Wirtschaft</span> and <span class='it'>Verwaltungshauptamt</span> and Chief
of the concentration camps. Due to these conferences and
through talks with the Chief of Office Gruppenfuehrer
Mueller of <span class='it'>Amt</span> IV and Gruppenfuehrer Nebe of <span class='it'>Amt</span> V, the
Chief of the Security Police and SD, SS Obergruppenfuehrer
Dr. Kaltenbrunner, must have known the state of affairs in
the concentration camps.” (<span class='it'>L-35</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>With full knowledge of conditions in and the purpose of
concentration camps, Kaltenbrunner ordered or permitted to be
ordered in his name the commitment of persons to concentration
camps.</span> All orders for protective custody other than short-term
confinements were issued in the name of Kaltenbrunner as
Chief of the Security Police and SD and bore the facsimile stamp
of his signature (<span class='it'>2477-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The commandant of Buchenwald concentration camp in his
affidavit states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“With the exception of the mass delivery of prisoners from
the concentration camps of occupied territories, all prisoners
were sent to the concentration camp Buchenwald on orders
of the <span class='it'>Reichssicherheitschauptamt</span>, Berlin. These preventive
arrest orders (red blanks) were in most cases signed with

orders were signed with ‘Foerster.’ ” (<span class='it'>L-38</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 7 July 1943 an order for protective custody was issued by
the Gestapo (<span class='it'>Amt</span> IV C 2, RSHA) bearing the facsimile signature
of Kaltenbrunner, to be sent in the form of a telegram to the
Gestapo office in Koeslin in the case of a woman whose offense
was stated to be failure to work, work sabotage, and asocial conduct.
She was ordered to be confined in the concentration camp
at Ravensbrueck (<span class='it'>2745-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 19 January 1944 a warrant for protective custody was
issued by the Gestapo (<span class='it'>Amt</span> IV C 2 of the RSHA) certified as
signed by Kaltenbrunner, to a British subject, C. S. James, on the
grounds that he had been proven guilty of activities to the detriment
of the German Reich, and that there was reason to expect
that he would, if released, commit acts prejudicial to the Reich
(<span class='it'>1574-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other instances of commitments to various concentration
camps on orders, signed by Kaltenbrunner, are contained in the
dossiers of 25 Luxembourgers committed to concentration camps
by the <span class='it'>Einsatzkommando</span> of the Sipo and SD in Luxembourg
during the year 1944. The concentration camps to which the persons
were committed included Dachau, Natzweiler, Sachsenhausen,
and Buchenwald. Among the grounds were: “strongly suspected
of working to the detriment of the Reich;” “spiteful statements
inimical to Germany as well as aspersions and threats
against persons active in the National Socialist movement;”
“strongly suspected of aiding desertion;” “as relative of a deserter
expected to take advantage of every occasion to harm the
German Reich.” (<span class='it'>L-215</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Further orders for commitments to concentration camps are
contained in file of 42 telegrams, all issued by the RSHA, <span class='it'>Amt</span>
IV A 6, Prague, to the Gestapo Office at Darmstadt, and all
signed by Kaltenbrunner, during the period from 20 September
1944 to 2 February 1945. The concentration camps to which
people were sent included Sachsenhausen, Ravensbrueck, Buchenwald,
Dachau, Bergen-Belsen, Flossenburg, and Theresienstadt.
Nationalities included Czech, German, French, Dutch, Italian,
Corsican, Lithuanian, Greek, and Jew. Grounds included “refusal
to work;” “religious propaganda;” “sex relations with
PWs;” “communist statements;” “loafing on job;” “working
against the Reich;” “spreading of rumors detrimental to morale;”
“<span class='it'>Aktion Gitter</span>;” “breach of work contracts;” “statements
<span class='pageno' title='582' id='Page_582'></span>
against Germany;” “assault of foreman;” “defeatist statements;”
“theft and escape from jail.” (<span class='it'>2239-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Kaltenbrunner authorized executions in concentration
camps.</span> Adolf Zutter, the adjutant of Mauthausen concentration
camp, avers that, until the assassination of Heydrich, orders for
executions at Mauthausen were signed by Heydrich or his substitute,
and that after Kaltenbrunner became Chief of the Security
Police and SD they were signed either by Kaltenbrunner or
by his substitute, Mueller. Zutter mentions a specific instance
in which Kaltenbrunner ordered the execution of a group of 12
to 15 uniformed members of an American military mission
(<span class='it'>L-51</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>Kaltenbrunner had knowledge of the commitment of
thousands of Warsaw Poles to concentration camps and refused
to release them.</span> During the suppression of the Warsaw uprising
of 1944, about 50,000 to 60,000 inhabitants of Warsaw were
sent to concentration camps. As a result of entreaties by Hans
Frank to Himmler the deportation was stopped. Frank and
Buehler, his State Secretary, requested Kaltenbrunner to release
the persons who had been committed. Kaltenbrunner refused
to release them on the grounds they were employed in making
secret weapons for the Reich and declared that the number transported
into concentration camps in the Reich was small. Buehler
verified the fact that the number of persons so placed in concentration
camps for forced labor was 50,000 to 69,999 (<span class='it'>2476-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(5) <span class='it'>Kaltenbrunner controlled the deportation of Poles, Jews,
and other non-Germans from Poland.</span> Otto Hofmann, former Chief
of the SS Main Office for Race and Settlement Matters, stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The execution of all so-called resettlement actions, that is,
the sending away of Polish, Jewish, and people of non-German
blood, inhabitants of a territory in Poland destined
for Germanization was in the hands of the Chief of the
RSHA, Heydrich, and, since the end of 1942, Kaltenbrunner.”
(<span class='it'>L-49</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(6) <span class='it'>Kaltenbrunner ordered the deportation of Jews from Denmark.</span>
In September 1943 Himmler ordered the Danish Jews
arrested and shipped to Stettin and from there to Theresienstadt
concentration camp. Mildner, the Chief of the Sipo and SD, telegraphed
the RSHA to request that the Jewish persecutions be
<span class='pageno' title='583' id='Page_583'></span>
stopped. In reply he received an order from Himmler through
Kaltenbrunner to carry out the anti-Jewish action. Shortly thereafter
Mildner flew to Berlin to speak to Kaltenbrunner personally
about the matter. In Kaltenbrunner’s absence he spoke to Mueller.
After his return to Copenhagen, Mildner received a direct
order from Himmler through Kaltenbrunner to carry out the anti-Jewish
actions immediately (<span class='it'>2375-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(7) <span class='it'>Kaltenbrunner personally exercised punitive authority
over foreign workers.</span> By order of Kaltenbrunner Labor Reformatory
Camps were established under the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Security Police (<span class='it'>1063-B-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to sending workers to Labor Reformatory Camps,
Kaltenbrunner, through orders for protective custody signed by
him or by facsimile of his signature, committed workers to concentration
camps. On 9 February 1945 a French citizen was
sent to Buchenwald by order of Kaltenbrunner for shirking work
and insubordinate behavior. On 18 June 1943 a Pole was sent
to Natzweiler “to be used as a skilled worker” by order of Kaltenbrunner.
On 2 December 1944 a citizen of the Netherlands
was taken into protective custody “for work sabotage” by order
of Kaltenbrunner. On 2 December 1944 a French citizen was
taken into protective custody for “work sabotage and insubmissive”
(<span class='it'>2582-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2580-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(8) <span class='it'>Kaltenbrunner personally attended to matters against Jews
and political and concentration camp internees in the Protectorate.</span>
A memorandum found among Kaltenbrunner’s personal effects
states in part:</p>

<p>“Radio message to Gruppenfuehrer Fegelein Hq. of the
Fuehrer through Sturmbannfuehrer Sansoni, Berlin.</p>

<p>“Please report to RF SS and to the Fuehrer that all arrangements

in the Protectorate have been taken care of by me
personally today” (<span class='it'>2519-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(9) <span class='it'>Kaltenbrunner personally ordered the Sipo and SD to encourage
the populace to lynch American and English flyers.</span> In
1944 at a conference of <span class='it'>Amt</span> Chiefs Kaltenbrunner said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“All offices of the SD and the security police are to be informed
that pogroms of the populace against English and

<p class='pindent'>(10) <span class='it'>Kaltenbrunner personally worked out the form of justification
to be submitted to cover up the execution of prisoners of
war.</span> In connection with the shooting of some 50 recaptured prisoners
of war who had escaped from a prisoner of war camp near
Breslau, Kaltenbrunner worked out with Mueller and Nebe the
false reasons which were to be given to the Red Cross, that is,
that they had been killed by bomb attacks, or shot while escaping
or resisting arrest (<span class='it'>2990-PS</span>).</p>

<h3>D. <span class='it'>CONCLUSION.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Kaltenbrunner was a life-long fanatical Nazi. He was the
leader of the SS in Austria prior to the Anschluss and played a
leading role in the betrayal of his native country to the Nazi
conspirators. As Higher SS and Police Leader in Austria after
the Anschluss he supervised and had knowledge of the activities
of the Gestapo and the SD in Austria. He had much to do with
developing Mauthausen concentration camp and visited it frequently.
On at least one occasion he observed the gas chamber
in action. With this knowledge and background he accepted in
January 1943 appointment as chief of the very agencies which
sent such victims to their deaths. He held that office to the end,
rising to high prominence in the conspiracy, receiving honors
from Hitler and gaining Hitler’s personal confidence.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='pageno' title='593' id='Page_593'></span>7. ALFRED ROSENBERG</h2>

<h3>A. <span class='it'>THE POLITICAL CAREER OF ROSENBERG.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>The political career of Alfred Rosenberg embraced the entire
history of National Socialism and permeated nearly every phase
of the conspiracy. In order to obtain a full conception of his
influence upon and participation in the conspiracy, it is necessary
to review his political history and to consider each of his political
activities in their relation to the thread of the conspiracy, which
stretches from the inception of the party in 1919 to the defeat of
Germany in 1945.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is interesting to note that for Rosenberg the 30th of November
1918 marked the</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Beginning of political activities with a lecture about the
‘Jewish Problem’ ”. (<span class='it'>2886-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>An official German pamphlet entitled, “Dates in the History of
the NSDAP”, discloses that Rosenberg was a member of the German
Labor Party (afterwards the National Socialist German
Workers Party) in January 1919, and that Hitler joined forces
with Rosenberg and his colleagues in October of the same year
(<span class='it'>3557-PS</span>). Thus, Rosenberg was a member of the National
Socialist movement even before Hitler himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An extract from “<span class='it'>Das Deutsche Fuehrer Lexikon</span>”, 1934/35
(<span class='it'>3530-PS</span>) completes the biographical data on Rosenberg:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“From 1921 until the present, editor of the <span class='it'>Voelkischer Beobachter</span>;
editor of the ‘N.S. Monatshefte’; 1930, Reichstag
deputy and representative of the foreign policy of the movement;
since April 1933, leader of the foreign political office
of the NSDAP; then designated as Reichsleiter; January
1934, deputized by the Fuehrer for the spiritual and philosophical
education of the NSDAP, the German labor front
and all related organizations” (<span class='it'>3530-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>In July 1941 Rosenberg was appointed Reichsminister for the
Occupied Eastern Territories. (<span class='it'>2886-PS</span>)</p>

<h3>B. <span class='it'>ROSENBERG’S PART, AS OFFICIAL NAZI IDEOLOGIST, IN PREPARING FOR THE SEIZURE OF POWER AND THE LAUNCHING OF AGGRESSIVE WAR.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg was the official National Socialist ideologist.
Through the ideological tenets which he expounded he exerted
an influence upon the unification of German thought, a unification
which was an essential part of the conspirator’s program for
seizure of power and preparation for aggressive war.
<span class='pageno' title='594' id='Page_594'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg wrote extensively on, and actively participated in,
virtually every aspect of the National Socialist program. His
first publication was the “Nature, Basic Principles, and Aims of
the NSDAP”, which appeared in 1922. Rosenberg spoke of this
book in the following terms:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“During this time (that is, during the early phase of the
party) a short thesis was written, which nevertheless is
significant in the history of the NSDAP. It was always
being asked what points of program the NSDAP had and
how they each were to be interpreted. Therefore, I wrote
the principal program and aims of the NSDAP, and this
writing made the first permanent connection between Munich
and local organizations being organized and friends
within the Reich.” (<span class='it'>3054-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Thus, the original draftsman of and spokesman for the party
program was Rosenberg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without attempting to survey the entire ideological program
advanced by Rosenberg in his various writings and speeches,
certain of his statements may be considered as indicating the
nature and scope of the ideological program which he championed.
There was not a single basic tenet of the Nazi philosophy
which was not given authoritative expression by Rosenberg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>The theory of racism.</span> Rosenberg wrote the “Myth of the
Twentieth Century”, published in 1930. At page 479 of this
work (<span class='it'>3553-PS</span>), Rosenberg expressed the following views on
the race question:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The essence of the contemporary world revolution lies in the
awakening of the racial types, not in Europe alone but on
the whole planet. This awakening is the organic counter
movement against the last chaotic remnants of liberal economic
imperialism, whose object of exploitation out of desperation
has fallen into the snare of Bolshevik Marxism, in
order to complete what democracy had begun, the extirpation
of the racial and national consciousness.” (<span class='it'>3553-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(2) “<span class='it'>Lebensraum</span>.” Rosenberg expounded the “<span class='it'>Lebensraum</span>”
idea, which was utilized as the dynamic impulse behind Germany’s
waging of aggressive war. In his journal, the “National
Socialist <span class='it'>Monatshefte</span>” for May 1932, he wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The understanding that the German nation, if it is not to
perish in the truest sense of the word, needs ground and soil
for itself and its future generations, and the second sober
perception that this soil can no more be conquered in Africa,
<span class='pageno' title='595' id='Page_595'></span>
but in Europe and first of all in the East—these organically
determine the German foreign policy for centuries.”
(<span class='it'>2777-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Persecution of Christian Churches.</span> Rosenberg expressed
his theory as to the place of religion in the National Socialist State
in the “Myth of the Twentieth Century”, additional excerpts
from which are cited in (<span class='it'>2891-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“We now realize that the central supreme values of the
Roman and the Protestant Churches, being a negative Christianity,
do not respond to our soul, that they hinder the organic
powers of the peoples determined by their Nordic race,
that they must give way to them, that they will have to be
remodeled to conform to a Germanic Christendom. Therein
lies the meaning of the present religious search.” (<span class='it'>2891-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>In the place of traditional Christianity, Rosenberg sought to implant
the neo-pagan myth of the blood. At page 114 in the “Myth
of the Twentieth Century” (<span class='it'>2891-PS</span>) he stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Today, a new faith is awakening—the Myth of the Blood,
the belief that the divine being of mankind generally is to be
defended with the blood. The faith embodied by the fullest
realization, that the Nordic blood constitutes that mystery
which has supplanted and overwhelmed the old sacraments.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg’s attitudes on religion were accepted as the only
philosophy compatible with National Socialism. In 1940 Bormann,
in writing to Rosenberg, made this statement:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The churches cannot be conquered by a compromise between
National Socialism and Christian teachings, but only
through a new ideology whose coming you yourself have
announced in your writings.” (<span class='it'>098-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg actively participated in the program for elimination
of church influence. Bormann frequently wrote Rosenberg in
this regard, furnishing him information as to proposed action to
be instituted against the churches and, where necessary, requesting
that action be taken by Rosenberg’s department. See
<span class='it'>070-PS</span> dealing with the abolition of religious services in the
schools; <span class='it'>072-PS</span> dealing with the confiscation of religious property;
<span class='it'>064-PS</span> dealing with the inadequacy of anti-religious material
circulated to the soldiers; <span class='it'>089-PS</span> dealing with the curtailment
of the publication of Protestant periodicals; and <span class='it'>122-PS</span>
dealing with the closing of theological faculties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>Persecution of the Jews.</span> Rosenberg was particularly
zealous in his pursuit of the “Jewish Question”. On 28 March
<span class='pageno' title='596' id='Page_596'></span>
1941, on the occasion of the opening of the Institute for the Exploration
of the Jewish Question, he set the keynote for its activities
and indicated the direction which the exploration was to take.
He spoke in part as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“For Germany the Jewish Question is only then solved when
the Last Jew has left the Greater German space.</p>

<p>“Since Germany with its blood and its nationalism has now
broken for always this Jewish dictatorship for all Europe
and has seen to it that Europe as a whole will become free
from the Jewish parasitism once more, we may, I believe,
also say for all Europeans: For Europe the Jewish question
is only then solved when the last Jew has left the European
continent.” (<span class='it'>2889-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg had called an Anti-Jewish Congress in June 1944,
but the Congress was cancelled due to military events. (<span class='it'>1752-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg did not overlook any opportunity to put these anti-Semitic
beliefs into practice. He recommended for instance that
instead of executing 100 Frenchmen as retaliation for attempts
on lives of members of the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>, there be executed 100
Jewish bankers, lawyers, etc. (<span class='it'>001-PS</span>). The recommendation was
made with the avowed purpose of awakening the anti-Jewish
sentiment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(5) <span class='it'>Abolition of Versailles Treaty.</span> In the realm of foreign
policy, in addition to demanding “<span class='it'>Lebensraum</span>,” Rosenberg called
for elimination of the Treaty of Versailles, and cast aside any
thought of revision of that treaty. In his book, “Nature, Principles
and Aims of the NSDAP”, Rosenberg wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The National Socialists reject the popular phrase of the
‘Revision of the Peace of Versailles’ as such a revision might
perhaps bring a few numerical reductions in the so-called
‘obligations,’ but the entire German people would still be,
just as before, the slave of other nations.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“ ‘We demand equality for the German people with other nations,
the cancellation of the peace treaties of Versailles and
St. Germain.’ ” (<span class='it'>2433-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(6) <span class='it'>Foreign Nazi Penetration.</span> Rosenberg conceived of the
spread of National Socialism throughout the world and, as will
be subsequently shown, took an active part in promoting the infection
of other nations with his creed. In the “Nature, Principles
and Aims of the NSDAP”, he stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“But National Socialism still believes that its principles and
<span class='pageno' title='597' id='Page_597'></span>
ideology though in individually different suitable ways of
fight according to racial-national conditions—will be directives
far beyond the borders of Germany for the inevitable
fights for power in other countries of Europe and America.
There too a decision of ideas must take place, and the racial-nationalistic
fight against the ever similar loan-capitalistic
and Marxist internationalism must be taken up. National
Socialism believes that once the great world battle is concluded,
after the defeat of the present epoch, there will be
a time when the swastika will be woven into the different
banners of the Germanic peoples as the Aryan symbol of
rejuvenation.” (<span class='it'>2433-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, Rosenberg gave authoritative expression to the basic
tenets upon which National Socialism was founded, and through
the exploitation of which the conspiracy was crystallized in action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(7) <span class='it'>Ideological training and education.</span> Rosenberg’s value to
the conspiratorial program found official recognition in his appointment
in 1934 as the Fuehrer’s Delegate for the Entire Spiritual
and Philosophical Education and Supervision of the NSDAP.
His activities in this capacity were many and varied. The National
Socialist Year Book for the year 1938, at page 180, describes
as follows the functions of Rosenberg’s office as the
Fuehrer’s delegate:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The sphere of activity of the Fuehrer’s Commissioner for
all spiritual and ideological instruction and education of the
movement, its organization, including the ‘Strength through
Joy’, extends to the detailed execution of all the educational
work of the Party and of the affiliated bodies. The office, set
up by <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> Rosenberg, has the task of preparing the
ideological educational material, of carrying out the teaching
programme, and is responsible for the education of those
teachers suited to this educational and instructional work.”
(<span class='it'>3531-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>As the Fuehrer’s delegate, Rosenberg thus supervised all ideological
education and training in the Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Rosenberg’s belief that upon the performance of his new
functions as ideological delegate depended the future of National
Socialism. An excerpt from an article by Rosenberg appearing
on page 9 of the March 1934 issue of “The Educational Letter”
states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The focus of all our educational work from now on is the
service for this ideology, and it depends on the result of
<span class='pageno' title='598' id='Page_598'></span>
these efforts, whether National Socialism will be buried with
our fighting ancestors or whether, as we believe, it really
represents the beginning of a new era.” (<span class='it'>3532-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In his capacity as the Fuehrer’s Delegate for Spiritual and
Ideological Training, Rosenberg assisted in the preparation of
the curriculum for the Adolf Hitler schools. These schools selected
the most suitable candidates from the Hitler Jugend and trained
them for leadership within the Party. They were the elite schools
of National Socialism. An excerpt from “Documents of German
Politics” reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“<span class='it'>Voelkischer Beobachter</span>, 19 January 1937.—‘As stated by
Dr. Ley, <span class='it'>Reichsorganisationsleiter</span>, on 23 November 1937 at
Ordensburg Sonthofen, these Adolf Hitler Schools, as the
first step of the principle of selecting a special elite, form an
important branch in the educational system of the National
Socialist training of future leaders [<span class='it'>Fuehrernachwuchs</span>]’</p>

<p>“<span class='it'>Voelkischer Beobachter</span> dated 24 November 1937.—* * *
The curriculum has been laid down by <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span> Rosenberg,
together with the <span class='it'>Reichsorganisationsleiter</span> and the
Reich Youth Leader.” (<span class='it'>3529-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg exercised further influence in the education of
Party members through the establishment of community schools
for all organizations of the Party. The following statement is
taken from the 1934 edition of “<span class='it'>Das Dritte Reich</span>”:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“We support the request of the Fuehrer’s Commissioner for
the supervision of the whole spiritual and ideological training
and instruction of the NSDAP, Party member Alfred
Rosenberg, to organize <span class='it'>community schools</span> of all organizations
of the NSDAP twice a year, in order to show by this
common effort the ideological and political unity of the
NSDAP and the steadfastness of the National Socialist will.”
(<span class='it'>3528-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Rosenberg’s program was endorsed by Schirach as well as by
Himmler, Ley, and others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virtually every phase of National Socialist training came under
Rosenberg’s influence, and unified ideological concepts were inculcated
in every echelon of the party due to his influence. The
1936 edition of “<span class='it'>Das Dritte Reich</span>”, under the heading “Education
in the Ordensburg” states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Those Party members, selected for training in leadership
in accordance with such points of view (who must have completed
their labor service and their military service satisfactorily)
are to be taught in the Ordensburgen by the best
teachers in history and science of race, philosophy and culture,
<span class='pageno' title='599' id='Page_599'></span>
economics and specialized training, etc. To determine
the ideological direction of this education, to choose suitable
teachers and to train them, is one of the tasks of the Senior
School of the Party [<span class='it'>Hohe Schule der Partei</span>] which is to be
established in the near future and will be placed under the
direction of the Reich Leader Party member Alfred Rosenberg
in his capacity as Delegate of the Fuehrer for the Supervision
of the Entire Spiritual and Ideological Teaching
and Education of the NSDAP.” (<span class='it'>3552-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(8) <span class='it'>Plunder of art treasures.</span> In his capacity as the Fuehrer’s
delegate, Rosenberg established the Institute for the Exploration
of the Jewish Question, in Frankfort on Main. (This institute,
commonly known as the “<span class='it'>Hohe Schule</span>”, has been referred to
in the discussion of the Plunder of Art Treasures in Chapter
XIV.) Into its library there flowed books, documents, and manuscripts
which were looted from virtually every country of occupied
Europe. As Ideological Delegate Rosenberg conducted the
fabulous art looting activities of the <span class='it'>Einsatzstab Rosenberg</span>, activities
which extended to France, Belgium, the Netherlands,
Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark, the Occupied Eastern Territories,
Hungary, and Greece. The extent of the plunder is indicated
in document <span class='it'>1015-B-PS</span> which contains a detailed account
of the seizure of over 21,000 valuable objects of art, and
in document <span class='it'>L-188</span> in which the looting of the contents of over
71,000 Jewish homes is described.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The importance of Rosenberg’s activities as official ideologist
of the Nazi party was not overlooked. The Hart biography of
Rosenberg, entitled, “The Man and His Work” (<span class='it'>3559-PS</span>), states
that Rosenberg won the German National prize in 1937. The
creation of this prize was the Nazis’ petulant reply to the award
of the Nobel prize to Carlin Assietsky, an inmate of a German
concentration camp. The citation which accompanied the award
to Rosenberg read as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Alfred Rosenberg has helped with his publications to lay
the scientific and intuitive foundation and to strengthen the
philosophy of the National Socialist in the most excellent
way. His indefatigable struggle to keep National Socialist
philosophy clean was especially meritorious. Only future
times will be able to fully estimate the depth of the influence
of this man on the philosophical foundation of the
National Socialist Reich. The National Socialist movement,
and beyond that, the entire German people, will be deeply
gratified that the Fuehrer has distinguished Alfred Rosenberg
<span class='pageno' title='600' id='Page_600'></span>
as one of his oldest and most faithful fighting comrades
by awarding him the German National Prize.” (<span class='it'>3559-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The contribution which Rosenberg’s book, “The Myth of the
Twentieth Century,” made to Nazi ideological propaganda was
appraised in the November 1942 edition of the official National
Socialist book review publication, “<span class='it'>Bucher Kunde</span>”, as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Next to the Fuehrer’s book it has contributed to a unique
extent to the rise and the spiritual and physical development
of this people. Twelve years after Alfred Rosenberg’s
‘Mythus’ first appeared, a million copies of the book have
been published and circulated.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“It must therefore be stated that the phrases coined by Alfred
Rosenberg have passed into the consciousness of the
whole people, and it is just today that they are proving
pillars of an ideological building whose completion is the
purpose of the fight being waged not least today.” (<span class='it'>3554-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The significance of ideological training in promoting the aims
of the conspiracy is emphasized in a brief statement which Hitler
made to his supreme commanders on 23 November 1939. On
that occasion, Hitler said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The building up of our armed forces was only possible in
connection with the ideological education of the German
people by the Party.” (<span class='it'>789-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The contribution which Rosenberg made through formulation
and dissemination of National Socialist ideology was fundamental
to the conspiracy. As apostle of neo-paganism, exponent of
the drive for “<span class='it'>Lebensraum</span>,” glorifier of the myth of nordic superiority,
and as one of the oldest and most energetic Nazi proponents
of anti-Semitism, he contributed materially to unification
of the German people behind the swastika. He provided the impetus
and philosophy of National Socialism.</p>

<h3>C. <span class='it'>ROSENBERG’S ACTIVITIES ABROAD, THROUGH THE APA, IN PREPARATION FOR AGGRESSIVE WAR.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg also actively contributed toward the preparation
for aggressive war through the international activities of the
APA (The Foreign Policy Office of the NSDAP). Rosenberg became
a <span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span>, the highest level of rank in the Leadership
Corps, and was made chief of the Foreign Political Office of the
NSDAP in April 1933 (<span class='it'>3530-PS</span>). The Organizational Manual
of the NSDAP (<span class='it'>2319-PS</span>) describes the functions of the APA as
<span class='pageno' title='601' id='Page_601'></span>
including the influencing of public opinion abroad so as to convince
foreign nations that Nazi Germany desires peace. The
following excerpt indicates the far-flung activities of the APA:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * II. 1. The APA is divided into three main offices:</p>

<p>“A. Office for Foreign Referats with the Main Offices.</p>

<p>“2. Moreover, there is in the APA a main office for the press
service and an educational office.” (<span class='it'>2319-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Press activities of the APA, designed to influence world
opinion in such a manner as to conceal the conspirators’ true
purposes and thus facilitate the preparation for waging aggressive
war, were conducted on an ambitious scale. “A Short Report
on the Activities of the APA of the NSDAP” describes the press
activities as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * <span class='it'>The Press</span>: The Press Division of the APA is
comprised of persons who together master all the languages
that are in use. Daily they examine approximately 300 newspapers
and deliver to the Fuehrer, the deputy Fuehrer, and
all other interested offices the condensations of the important
trends of the entire world press. I know that these press
reports are highly praised by all who constantly follow them.
The Press Division furthermore conducts an exact archives
on the attitudes of the most important papers of the world
and an exact archives on the most important journalists of
the world. Many embarrassments during conferences in
Germany could have been avoided had one consulted these
archives (case of Leumas, Nurnberg, 1934; case of Dorothy
Thompson; and others). Further, the Press Division was
able to arrange a host of interviews as well as conducting a
great number of friendly foreign journalists to the various
official representatives of Germany.” (<span class='it'>003-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The nature and extent of the activities of the APA are amply
disclosed in a “Report on the Activities of the Foreign Affairs
Bureau of the Party from 1933 to 1943,” signed by Rosenberg
(<span class='it'>007-PS</span>). This report contains a recital of widespread activities
in foreign countries. These activities range from the promotion
<span class='pageno' title='602' id='Page_602'></span>
of economic penetration, to fomentation of anti-Semitism; from
cultural and political infiltration to the instigation of treason.
Activities were carried on throughout the world and extended to
such widely separated points as the Middle East and Brazil.
(<span class='it'>007-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Activities in Hungary, Belgium, Holland, and Luxembourg.</span>
Much of the APA’s achievements were brought about
through the subtle exploitation of personal relationship. Activities
in Hungary proceeded as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * <span class='it'>The first foreign state visit after the seizure of
power took place through the mediation of the Foreign Affairs
Bureau.</span> Julius Gombos, who in former years had himself
pursued anti-Semitic and racial tendencies, had reached
the Hungarian Premier’s chair. The Bureau maintained a
personal connection with him.” (<span class='it'>007-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The APA endeavored to strengthen the War Economy by shifting
the source of food imports to the Balkans:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Motivated by reasons of War Economy, the Bureau advocated
<span class='it'>the transfer of raw material purchases from overseas</span>
to the areas accessible by overland traffic routes, i.e.,
primarily <span class='it'>in the Balkans</span>, naturally insofar as practicable.
At first little heed was paid to the Bureau in these endeavors,
but it later secured the active support especially of the Food
Estate [<span class='it'>Naeurstand</span>]. Through its cooperation, e.g., on the
subject of fruit and vegetable imports, a very substantial
shift in the source of imports was attained, particularly
through the currently initiated cooperation with Croatian
and Hungarian cooperatives as well as with commercial associations
all over the Balkans.” (<span class='it'>007-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Activities in Belgium, Holland, and Luxembourg were confined
to “observation of existing conditions” and “to the establishment
of relations, especially of a commercial nature.” (<span class='it'>007-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Activities in Iran, Afghanistan, and Iraq.</span> In Iran the
APA achieved a high degree of economic penetration, in addition
to promoting cultural relations:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Bureau’s initiative in developing, with the help of commercial
circles, entirely new methods for the economic penetration
of Iran found expression, in an extraordinarily favorable
way, in reciprocal trade relations.</p>

<p>“Naturally in Germany, too, this initiative at first encountered
a completely negative attitude and resistance on
<span class='pageno' title='603' id='Page_603'></span>
the part of the competent state authorities, an attitude that
had first to be overcome.</p>

<p>“In the course of a few years the volume of trade with Iran
was multiplied five-fold, and in 1939 Iran’s trade turnover
with Germany had attained first place. Even Soviet Russia,
the competitor who had been biggest and most dreaded previously,
had been eliminated from the running. Concurrently
with activation of commercial relations, the Bureau had
also intensified cultural relations and had, in conjunction
with growing commercial influence and in closest collaboration
with the Iranian Government, created a series of cultural
institutions headed and directed by Germans.” (<span class='it'>007-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg further reports on APA activities in other parts
of the world:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Afghanistan’s neutral position today is largely due to the
Bureau’s activity.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The <span class='it'>Arab question</span>, too, became part of the work of the
Bureau. In spite of England’s tutelage of <span class='it'>Iraq</span> the Bureau
established a series of connections to a number of leading
personalities of the Arab world, smoothing the way for
strong bonds to Germany. In this connection, the growing
influence of the Reich in Iran and Afghanistan did not fail
to have repercussions in Arabia.” (<span class='it'>007-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In view of the numerous “personal connections” maintained
by the Bureau in many different countries, it is not difficult to
surmise what Rosenberg meant when he stated at the conclusion
of his report:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Bureau has carried out the initiating of all politically
feasible projects. With the outbreak of war it [the APA]
was entitled to consider its task as terminated. The exploitation
of the many <span class='it'>personal</span> connections in many lands
can be resumed under a different guise.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“(Signed)&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosenberg” (<span class='it'>007-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Activities in Rumania.</span> Annex Two of the report deals
with activities in Rumania. Here the APA’s intrigue was more
insidious, its interference in the internal affairs of a foreign
nation more pronounced. After describing the failure of what
Rosenberg terms a “basically sound anti-Semitic tendency”, due
to dynastic squabbles and party fights, Rosenberg describes the
APA’s influence in the unification of conflicting elements:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“What was lacking was the guiding leadership of a political
<span class='pageno' title='604' id='Page_604'></span>
personality. After manifold groping trials the Bureau
believed to have found such a personality—the former Minister
and poet, Octavian Goga. It was not difficult to convince
this poet, pervaded by instinctive inspiration, that a
Greater Rumania, though it had to be created in opposition
to Vienna, could be maintained only together with Berlin.
Nor was it difficult to create in him the desire to link the
fate of Rumania with the future of the National-Socialist
German Reich in good time. By bringing continuing influence
to bear, the Bureau succeeded in inducing Octavian
Goga as well as Professor Cuza to amalgamate the parties
under their leadership on an Anti-Semitic basis. Thus they
could carry on with united strength the struggle for Rumania’s
renascence internally, and her <span class='it'>Anschluss</span> with Germany
externally. Through the Bureau’s initiative both parties,
which had heretofore been known by distinct names,
were merged as the National-Christian Party, under Goga’s
leadership and with Cuza as Honorary President.” (<span class='it'>007-PS,
Annex II</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg’s man, Goga, was supported by two “splinter parties”
which had not joined the anti-Semitic trend of these two
parties. Rosenberg has this to say:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>Through intermediaries</span>, the Bureau <span class='it'>maintained constant
contact</span> with both tendencies, just as it constantly consulted
with Goga, through Staff Director [Stabsleiter] Schickendanz,
about tactics to be followed.” (<span class='it'>007-PS, Annex II</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Goga was appointed Prime Minister by the King in December
1937. The influence of Rosenberg’s ideology had achieved a major
triumph, for he states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>Thus a second government on racial and anti-Semitic foundations
had appeared in Europe, in a country in which such
an event had been considered completely impossible.</span>” (<span class='it'>007-PS,
Annex II</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg’s intrigues made a significant contribution to Nazi
preparations for aggressive war, and the benefit to Germany’s
position in the Balkans was great. Rosenberg reports that upon
Goga’s resignation he left a personal heir in Marshal Antonescu,
who was appointed by Goga as Minister of War against the
wishes of the King. Of Antonescu Rosenberg says:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“After Goga’s resignation, Antonescu still remained in the
king’s cabinet at Goga’s wish. He also maintained continued
relations with the Iron Guard. Thereby the possibility
of eliminating the king was at hand—and was exploited.
<span class='pageno' title='605' id='Page_605'></span>
Antonescu today appears in practice as executor of
the heritage bequested to him by Goga, who had led him from
political insignificance into the political arena. Thereby a
change to Germany’s liking had become possible in Rumania.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;margin-top:1em;'>“(Signed) Rosenberg.” (<span class='it'>007-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>It will be recalled that on 5 September 1940 Antonescu became
President of the Rumanian Council of Ministers and immediately
suspended the Rumanian constitution. King Carol abdicated on
the following day, and Rumania existed as a German satellite
throughout the war. Rosenberg’s aims had been achieved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The substantial contribution which Rosenberg had thus made
to Germany’s strategic plans for aggressive war is evident from
a brief review of the military action which followed in the wake
of his political maneuvers. Shortly after King Carol’s abdication
Antonescu “invited” German troops to “protect” the Rumanian
oil fields. When Hungary subscribed to the Axis pact a few
weeks later, Germany acquired a continuous land bridge to the
Black Sea, through Austria, Hungary, and Rumania. When
Bulgaria subscribed to the Pact in March 1941, a German thrust
southward through Yugoslavia and Greece became feasible, for
with Hungary, Rumania, and Bulgaria secure, the entire German
eastern flank was safe from attack. A month later, Yugoslavia
and Greece were invaded. Only when they were overcome was
Germany free to attack the Soviet Union. Seven weeks after the
fall of Crete, Germany launched her war on the U.S.S.R. Thus,
Rosenberg’s intrigue in Rumania provided a vital link in the
chain of the German strategy of aggression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>Relations with Quisling in Norway.</span> Rosenberg also
played a leading role in the development of fifth-column activities
in Norway. He fostered the development of close relations between
Germany and Quisling, procured financial backing for
Quisling’s activities, and brought him into contact with Raeder
and Hitler. Rosenberg kept the Reich informed as to internal
developments in Norway through his contacts with Hagelin,
Quisling’s deputy, and took an active part in the development of
plans for a Quisling coup in Norway. The record is clear that
Rosenberg provided the inspiration and the means for the betrayal
of Norway by Quisling and Hagelin—treason for which
the Norwegian Government has tried, condemned, and executed
them. (<span class='it'>007-PS</span>; <span class='it'>C-64</span>; <span class='it'>C-65</span>; <span class='it'>C-66</span>; <span class='it'>004-PS</span>; <span class='it'>957-PS</span>)

<h3>D. <span class='it'>ROSENBERG’S PARTICIPATION IN THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT WAR CRIMES AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY IN THE OCCUPIED EASTERN TERRITORIES.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg participated in the conspiracy to commit war crimes
and crimes against humanity in the areas of the Occupied East
which he administered for over three years. This area included
the Baltic States, White Ruthenia and the Ukraine, and the Eastern
portion of Poland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(The mass murder and mistreatment of the Eastern peoples,
and the spoliation of their territories is discussed in Chapter X
on Forced Labor, Chapter XIII on Germanization and Spoliation,
Chapter XI on Concentration Camps, Chapter XII on Persecution
of the Jews, Section 5 of Chapter XV on the SS, and Section
6 of Chapter XV on the Gestapo and SD.) Rosenberg bears personal
responsibility for these crimes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosenberg may contend that some of these crimes were committed
against his wishes. There is, indeed, some evidence that
he protested on occasion, not out of humanitarian reasons, but
on the ground of political expediency. Rosenberg may also attempt
to place the blame for these crimes on other agencies and
other defendants. The documents prove, however, that he himself
formulated the harsh policies in the execution of which the
crimes were committed; that the crimes were committed for the
most part by persons and agencies within his jurisdiction and
control; that the other agencies which participated in the commission
of these crimes were invited by him to cooperate in the
administration of the East, although the brutal methods customarily
employed by them were common knowledge; and that his
Ministry lent full cooperation to their activities despite the criminal
methods that were employed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1). <span class='it'>Activities as “Commissioner for the Central Control of
Questions Connected with the East European Region.”</span> Rosenberg
was actively participating in the affairs of the East as early as
20 April 1941, two months prior to the German attack upon the
Soviet Union. On that date he was designated by Hitler as “Commissioner
for the Central Control of Questions connected with
the East European Region” (<span class='it'>865-PS</span>). The initial preparations
undertaken by Rosenberg for fulfillment of his new task indicate
the extent to which he cooperated in promoting the military plans
for aggression. They also show that he understood his task as
requiring the assistance of a multitude of Reich agencies and
that he invited their cooperation.
<span class='pageno' title='607' id='Page_607'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Shortly after his appointment by Hitler, Rosenberg conducted
a series of conferences with representatives of various Reich
agencies (<span class='it'>1039-PS</span>). Cooperation of the following agencies in
the administration of the Eastern Territories was contemplated
and solicited by Rosenberg:</p>

<div class='lgl' style='margin-top:.5em;'> <!-- rend=';ml:4em;' -->
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:4em;'>OKW</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:4em;'>The SS</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:4em;'>and the SA—(as well as several others). (<span class='it'>1039-PS</span>)</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>These arrangements, it should be noted, were made by Rosenberg
in his capacity as Commissioner on Eastern Questions—before
the attack on the Soviet Union, before Rosenberg was appointed
Minister of the Occupied East, and before there was any
Occupied Eastern Territory for Germany to administer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) <span class='it'>“Solution” of the Jewish Problem.</span> Emphasis must be
placed on Rosenberg’s basic attitudes regarding his new task, and
the directives he knew he would be expected to follow. On 29
April 1941 he stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“A general treatment is required for the Jewish problem for
which a temporary solution will have to be determined
(forced labor for the Jews, creation of Ghettos, etc.)”
(<span class='it'>1024-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 8 May 1941, instructions were prepared for all Reich Commissars
in the Occupied Eastern Territories (<span class='it'>1030-PS</span>). The last
paragraph of these instructions reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“From the point of view of cultural policy, the German
Reich is in a position to promote and direct national culture
and science in many fields. It will be necessary that in some
territories an uprooting and resettlement of various racial
stocks [<span class='it'>Voelkerschaften</span>] will have to be effected.” (<span class='it'>1030-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In his “Instructions for a Reich Commissar in the Baltic Countries
and White Russia” (officially referred to together as the
“Ostland”), Rosenberg directs that the Ostland be transformed
into a part of the Greater German Reich by Germanizing racially
possible elements, colonizing Germanic races, and banishing undesirable
elements. (<span class='it'>1029-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a speech delivered by Rosenberg on 20 June 1941 he stated
<span class='pageno' title='608' id='Page_608'></span>
that the job of feeding Germans was the top of Germany’s claim
on the East; that there was no obligation to feed also the Russian
peoples; that this was a harsh necessity bare of any feeling; that
a very extensive evacuation would be necessary; and that the
future would hold many hard years in store for the Russians.
(<span class='it'>1058-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 22 June 1941 the German armies invaded the U.S.S.R.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) <span class='it'>Deportation of Prisoners of War for Labor in the Reich.</span>
On 4 July 1941 a representative of the Rosenberg Bureau attended
a conference on the subject of mobilization of labor and
utilization of Soviet prisoners of war. A memorandum of this
conference (<span class='it'>1199-PS</span>) states that among the participants were
representatives of the Commissioner for the Four-Year Plan, of
the Reich Labor Ministry, of the Reich Food Ministry, and of the
Rosenberg Bureau. The conference proceeded as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“After an introduction by Lt. Col. Dr. Krull, Lt. Col. Breyer
of the P.W. department explained that actually there was
in effect a prohibition by the Fuehrer against bringing Russian
P.W.’s into the Reich for mobilization of labor
[<span class='it'>Arbeitseinsatz</span>]; but that one might count on this prohibition
being relaxed a little.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The chairman summarized the results of the discussion as
indicating that all the interested bureaus unqualifiedly advocated
and supported the demand for utilization of P.W.’s
because of manpower needs [<span class='it'>Arbeitseinsatz</span>] in the Reich.
The War Economy and Armament office will approach the
Commissioner for the Four-Year Plan with a request for relaxation
of the restrictive regulations and express to the
Chief of Operational Staff of the Armed Forces its point of
view, accordingly.” (<span class='it'>1199-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) <span class='it'>Germanization.</span> On 16 July 1941, the day before Rosenberg’s
appointment as Minister of the Occupied East, he attended
a conference at the Fuehrer’s Headquarters. At that time Hitler
stated that</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Crimea has to be evacuated by all foreigners and to be
settled by Germans alone.” (<span class='it'>L-221</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Hitler further stated that Germany’s objectives in the East were
three-fold, first, to dominate it; second, to administer it; third, to
exploit it. (<span class='it'>L-221</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, the character of the administration contemplated for the
Occupied East was well established before Rosenberg took office
as Minister of the Occupied East. He knew of these plans and
was in accord with them. Persecution of the Jews, forced labor
<span class='pageno' title='609' id='Page_609'></span>
of prisoners of war, Germanization and exploitation were basic
points of policy at the time he assumed office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Activities as Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories.</span>
On 17 July 1941 Hitler appointed Rosenberg as Reichsminister
for the Occupied Eastern Territories, territories which
included nearly all the area seized by Germany from the U. S. S.
R. (<span class='it'>1997-PS</span>)</p>

found in document <span class='it'>1056-PS</span>. Thus, <span class='it'>1056-PS</span> is identified as being a
reproduction of Part I of the Brown Folder which was mentioned
in the “Green Folder,” and was issued by the Reich Minister for
the Occupied Eastern Territories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The directives issued by the Rosenberg Ministry itself (<span class='it'>1056-PS</span>)
prove the extent of Rosenberg’s authority: he was the Supreme
civilian authority in the Eastern Territories. There was a
continuous chain of command from Rosenberg down to regional
administrative officials, extending even to the local prison warden
(<span class='it'>1056-PS</span>). The relationship which existed between the Rosenberg
Ministry and other German agencies varied from full control
by Rosenberg, to close cooperation with them made mandatory
by his directives and by Hitler’s orders. Finally, the various subdivisions
of the Ministry, were required to submit period-reports
of the situation within their jurisdiction—so that the numerous
reports of brutality which Rosenberg received were submitted to
him pursuant to his orders. (<span class='it'>1056-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The treatise on the organization of Rosenberg’s ministry states
as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The newly occupied Eastern Territories are subordinated to
the Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories. By

Within the scope of these instructions he acts on his own responsibility.</p>

<p>“Subordinate offices of the Reich Commissar are:</p>

<p>“General Commissariats,</p>

<p>“Main Commissariats,</p>

<p>“District Commissariats.” (<span class='it'>1056-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The SS was placed under Rosenberg’s jurisdiction and control:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Higher SS-&nbsp;and Police Leader is directly subordinated
to the Reich Commissar. However, the Chief of Staff has
the general right to secure information from him also. His
official title is:</p>

<p>‘The Reich Commissar for the Eastern Territory
The Higher SS-&nbsp;and Police Leader.’</p>

<p>“Great stress is to be placed on close cooperation between
him, the Chief of Staff, and the other Main Department
Heads of the office of the Reich Commissar, particularly with
the one for Policies.” (<span class='it'>1056-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The scope of Rosenberg’s control over the SS in the Occupied
Eastern Territories is revealed in a decree signed by Rosenberg,
dated 17 July 1941, and found in the <span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt</span> of the
Reich Minister for the Occupied East, 1942 #2, pages 7 and 8.
This decree provides for the creation of summary courts-martial
to punish crimes committed by non-Germans in the East, as determined
by the Reich Commissar. The courts are to be presided
over by a police officer or an SS leader, who have authority to
<span class='pageno' title='611' id='Page_611'></span>
order the death sentence and confiscation of property, and whose
decisions are not subject to appeal. The General Commissar is
given the right to reject a summary Courts’ decision. Thus, the
determination of the SS is subordinated to the authority of
Rosenberg’s Ministry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The position of the General Commissar is defined as follows in
the organizational treatise:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The General Commissar forms the administrative office of
intermediate appeal. Within his jurisdiction he heads the
administration according to the general directives of the
Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories and the
prescriptions of the Reich Commissar.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The SS-&nbsp;and <span class='it'>Police Leader</span> assigned to the General Commissar
is directly subordinated to him; however, the Chief of
Staff has the general right of requiring information from
him.” (<span class='it'>1056-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Regional Commissars are described as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Regional Commissar heads the entire administration of
the lower administrative office in the Circuit District [<span class='it'>Kreisgebiet</span>]
in accordance with the instructions of the General
Commissar and the superior offices * * *. The leader of
the police unit assigned to him is directly subordinated to
him.” (<span class='it'>1056-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Main Commissars are described in these terms:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Upon recommendation by the Reich Commissar the Reich
Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories appoints Main
Commissars for Main Districts formed by the consolidation of
several Circuit Districts.” (<span class='it'>1056-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The order of superiority in the service among these various
officials is stated as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories is
the service superior of the Reich Commissar and the officials
and the employees subordinate to them. The Reich Commissar
is the superior of all officials and employees of his office
and of the offices subordinate to him. The General Commissar
is the superior of the officials and employees of his office
and of the officials and employees of the offices of the Main
and Regional Commissars. The Main Commissar and the
Regional Commissar are the superior of the officials and employees
of their offices.” (<span class='it'>1056-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Thus, there is a continuous chain of command and of accountability
from the Reich Minister, Rosenberg, down through each
subdivision of the Ministry.
<span class='pageno' title='612' id='Page_612'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Furthermore, Rosenberg had authority to legislate for the entire
area, and the jurisdiction of his Ministry was exclusive,
aside from that of the military. The organizational treatise states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Reich Commissars, General Commissars, Main Commissars
and Regional Commissars (City Commissars) are—aside
from the military agencies—the only Reich authorities
[<span class='it'>Reichsbehoerden</span>] in the Occupied Eastern Territories.
Other Reich authorities may not be established alongside
them. They handle all questions of administration of the
area which is subordinate to their sovereignty and all affairs
which concern the organization and activity of the administration
including those of the Police in the supervision
of the native [<span class='it'>landeseigenen</span>] agencies and organizations, and
of the population.</p>

<p>“The Reich Minister governs the occupied Eastern Territories
by order of the Fuehrer. He can make the law for all
the territories.” (<span class='it'>1056-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The following passage shows that the economic exploitation of
the territory was undertaken in fullest cooperation with the Commissioner
of the Four-Year Plan:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Fuehrer has entrusted Reich Marshal Hermann Goering,
as Commissioner for the Four Year Plan, with the supervision
of the tasks of the war economy in the Occupied
Eastern Territories. The economic inspectorates and economic
commands are active there as his representatives
[<span class='it'>Organe</span>] [see Green Folio]. These economic inspectorates
and economic commands will be substantially absorbed in the
agencies of the civil administration after the establishment
of the civil administration.” (<span class='it'>1056-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Careful provision was made for channeling to Rosenberg complete
and accurate information as to the situation throughout the
territory governed by him:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Reich and General Commissars will determine the
periods at which the subordinate agencies are to report regularly
about the general situation without prejudice to the
duty to provide individual reports and special delivery reports
(at first, at short intervals which can be later lengthened).
At first the Reich Commissars will give the Reich
Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories a comprehensive
report on the situation in brief form twice a month, on
the first and fifteenth of each month. The Reich Minister is
to be given a report by the Reich Commissar immediately
about incidents of an especially important nature. The
General Commissars and Regional Commissars must report
<span class='pageno' title='613' id='Page_613'></span>
directly to the Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories
by the quickest means particularly important incidents,
as, for example, widespread unrest, more important
acts of sabotage and strikes, great natural catastrophes and
the like, and at the same time report them to the next superior
agency.” (<span class='it'>1056-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Second Section of this organizational treatise, entitled
“Working directives for the Civil Administration,” contains this
statement:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * the Hague Rules of Land Warfare which deal
with the administration of a country occupied by a foreign
armed power are not valid.” (<span class='it'>1056-PS</span>; <span class='it'>EC-347</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>The document continues as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The handling of cases of sabotage is the concern of the
Senior SS-&nbsp;and Police Leader, of the SS- and Police Leader
and/or the police leaders of the lower echelon. Insofar, however,
as collective measures against the population of a
definite region appear appropriate, the decision about them
rests with the competent Commissar on the proposal of the
Police Leader. The calling of the population for the tasks of
guarding can be ordered by the Regional Commissar.</p>

<p>“The assessment of fines of money or goods, as well as the
ordering of the seizure of hostages and the shooting of inhabitants
of the territory in which the acts of sabotage have
taken place, can only be by the General Commissar, insofar
as the Reich Commissar himself does not intervene.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The District Commissar is responsible for the supervision
of all prisons, insofar as the Reich Commissar does not decree
otherwise.” (<span class='it'>1056-PS</span>; <span class='it'>EC-347</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) <span class='it'>Rosenberg’s Use of His Authority and Power for Criminal
Purposes.</span> The manner in which Rosenberg’s authority and power
were wielded is illustrated in other sections of this volume, which
show that in the Eastern Territories millions of Jews were exterminated;
that millions of slave laborers were pressed into service
under indescribable conditions; that the populace was degraded,
starved, beaten, and murdered; and that the country was
stripped of its resources. However, in order to illustrate the
manner in which Rosenberg participated in the criminal activities
conducted within his jurisdiction, four examples may be
mentioned.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p><span class='it'>1. Seizure of Jewish Property.</span> The first illustration is contained
in the decree signed by Lohse, Reichscommissar for
the Ostland, which is published in the <span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt</span> of
<span class='pageno' title='614' id='Page_614'></span>
the Reichscommissar for the Ostland, 1942, No. 38, pages
158 and 159. This decree provides for the seizure of the entire
property of the Jewish population in the Ostland, including
the claims of Jews against third parties. The seizure
was made retroactive to the day of the occupation of the territory
by the German troops. This sweeping decree was issued
and published by Rosenberg’s immediate subordinate,
and it must be assumed that Rosenberg knew of it and acquiesced
in it. The power to enact such a decree, as previously
outlined, arose by virtue of delegation of that power
by Rosenberg to the Reichscommissar.</p>

<p><span class='it'>2. Extermination of Jews.</span> The second illustration is the report
of the prison warden of Minsk that 516 German and
Russian Jews had been killed. The warden called attention
to the fact that valuable gold had been lost due to the failure
to knock out the tooth-fillings of the victims before they were
done away with (<span class='it'>R-135</span>).</p>

<p><span class='it'>3. Deportations for Forced Labor.</span> The third illustration is
a letter which Rosenberg wrote to Sauckel on 21 December
1942 in the following terms:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I thank you very much for your report on the execution
of the great task given to you, and I am glad to hear
that in carrying out your mission you have always found
the necessary support, even on the part of the civilian
authorities in the occupied Eastern territories. For myself
and the officials under my command this collaboration
was and is self-evident, especially since both you
and I have, with regard to the solution of the labor
problem in the East, represented the same view-points
from the beginning.” (<span class='it'>018-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>As late as 11 July 1944 the Rosenberg Ministry was actively
concerned with the continuation of the forced labor program
in spite of the retreat from the East. A letter from Alfred
Meyer, Rosenberg’s deputy, addressed to Sauckel, dated 11
July 1944 shows that this time it is Rosenberg’s Ministry that
is urging action:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“1. * * * The war employment command [<span class='it'>Kriegseinsatzkommando</span>]
formerly stationed in Minsk must continue
under all circumstances the calling in of your white
Ruthenian and Russian manpower for military employment
in the Reich. In addition, the command has the
mission to bring young boys of 10-14 years of age to the
Reich.” (<span class='it'>199-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pageno' title='615' id='Page_615'></span></p>

<p><span class='it'>4. Economic Exploitation.</span> The final illustration of Rosenberg’s
criminal responsibility is contained in a secret letter
from Rosenberg to Bormann dated 17 October 1944 (<span class='it'>327-PS</span>).
It furnishes a graphic account of Rosenberg’s activities
in the economic exploitation of the Occupied East. The
first paragraph reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“In order not to delay the liquidation of companies under
my supervision, I beg to point out that the companies
concerned are not private firms but business enterprises
of the Reich, so that also actions with regard to
them, just as with regard to government offices, are reserved
to the highest authorities of the Reich. I supervise
the following companies * * *.” (<span class='it'>327-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>There follows a list of nine companies—a trading company,
an agricultural development Company, a supply company, a
pharmaceutical company, and five banking concerns. The
mission of the trading company is stated to be:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Collection of all agricultural products as well as commercial
marketing and transportation thereof. (Delivery
to armed forces and the Reich.)” (<span class='it'>327-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>The letter continues as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<h3>B. <span class='it'>FRANK PROMOTED THE SEIZURE OF POWER BY THE NAZI CONSPIRATORS. AS THE LEADING NAZI JURIST, HE FURTHERED THE REALIZATION OF THE CONSPIRATORS’ PROGRAM IN THE FIELD OF LAW.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Frank himself described his role in the Nazi struggle for power
in the following words in August 1942:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I have since 1920 continually dedicated my work to the
NSDAP. * * * As National Socialist I was a participant
in the events of November 1923, for which I received
the <span class='it'>Blutorden</span>. After the resurrection of the movement in
the year 1925, my real greater activity in the movement began,
which made me, first gradually, later almost exclusively,
the legal advisor of the Fuehrer and of the Reich leadership
of the NSDAP. I thus was the representative of legal interests
of the growing Third Reich in a legal ideological as well
as practical legal way. * * * The culmination of this
work I see in the big Leipzig Army Trial in which I succeeded
in having the Fuehrer admitted to the famous oath of
legality, a circumstance which gave the Movement the legal
grounds to expand generously. The Fuehrer indeed recognized
this achievement and in 1926 made me leader of the
National Socialist Lawyers League; in 1929 Reich Leader of
the Reich Legal Office of the NSDAP; in 1933 Bavarian
Minister of Justice; in the same year Reich Commissioner
of Justice; in 1934 President of the Academy of German Law
founded by me; in December 1934 Reich Minister Without
Portfolio; and in 1939 I was finally appointed to Governor
General for the occupied Polish territories.</p>

<p>“So I was, am and will remain the representative jurist of
the struggle period of National Socialism. * * *</p>

<p>“I profess myself now, and always, as a National Socialist
and a faithful follower of the Fuehrer Adolf Hitler, whom I
have now served since 1919.” (<span class='it'>2233-X-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Frank’s Diary, from which this quotation is taken, to which frequent
reference is made in this section, is the official journal, kept
at Frank’s direction, of his administration in the General Government.
<span class='pageno' title='626' id='Page_626'></span>
It consists of 38 volumes in which are recorded the official
texts of speeches, transcripts of conferences, minutes of cabinet
sessions, etc. The volumes are divided into several concurrent
series (<span class='it'>Tagebuch, Abteilungsleitersitzungen</span> etc.) which cover the
several aspects of the official business of the administration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the “representative jurist of the struggle period of National
Socialism” and in the various juridical capacities listed in the
preceding section, Frank was between 1933 and 1939 the most
prominent policy-maker in the field of German legal theory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1934 Frank founded the Academy of German Law, of which
he was president until 1942. The statute defining the functions
of the Academy conferred on it wide power to coordinate juridical
policies:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“It is the task of the Academy for German Law to further
the rejuvenation of the Law in Germany. Closely connected
with the agencies competent for legislation, it shall further
the realization of the National Socialist Program in the realm
of Law. This task shall be carried out through well-fixed scientific
methods.</p>

<p>“The Academy’s task shall cover primarily:</p>

<p>“1. The composition, the initiation, judging and preparing of
drafts of law.</p>

<p>“2. The collaboration in rejuvenating and unifying the training
in jurisprudence and political science.</p>

<p>“3. The editing and supporting of scientific publications.</p>

<p>“4. The financial assistance for research and work in specific
fields of Law and Political Economy.</p>

<p>“5. The organization of scientific meetings and the organization
of courses.</p>

<p>“6. The cultivation of connections to similar institutions in
foreign countries”. (<span class='it'>1391-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>What Frank as policy-maker in the field of law conceived as
his task he explained in a radio address on 20 March 1934:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The first task was that of establishing a unified German
State. It was an outstanding historical and juristic—political
accomplishment on the part of our Fuehrer that he
reached boldly into the development of history and thereby
eliminated the sovereignty of the various German states.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>“The second fundamental law of the Hitler Reich is racial
legislation. The National Socialists were the first ones in the
entire history of human law to elevate the concept of race
to the status of a legal term. The German nation, unified
racially and nationally, will in the future be legally protected
<span class='pageno' title='627' id='Page_627'></span>
against any further disintegration of the German race
stock.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>“The sixth fundamental law was the legal elimination of
those political organizations which within the state, during
the period of the reconstruction of the people and the Reich,
were once able to place their selfish aims ahead of the common
good of the nation. This elimination has taken place
entirely legally. It is not the coming to the fore of despotic
tendencies but it was the necessary legal consequence of a
clear political result, of the 14 years’ struggle of the NSDAP.</p>

<p>“In accordance with these unified legal aims in all spheres,
particular efforts have for months now been made as regards
the work of the great reform of the entire field of German
law. * * *” (<span class='it'>2536-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Frank concluded his remarks by pointing out that the outward
forms of legality could be preserved in building the Nazi state:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“As a leader of the German Jurists I am convinced that together
with all strata of the German people, we shall be able
to construct the legal state of Adolf Hitler in every respect
and to such an extent that no one in the world will at any
time be able to attack this legal state as regards its laws”.
(<span class='it'>2536-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In his speech at the Congress of the Reich Group of University
Professors of the National Socialist Jurists’ League on 3 October
1936, Frank explained the necessity for excluding Jews from the
legal field:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * this topic embraces all that which in our opinion
will contribute to establishing National Socialism in the field
of jurisprudence, thus eliminating any alien racial spirit
therefrom. * * *</p>

<p>“We National Socialists have started with anti-Semitism in
our fight to free the German people, to re-establish a German
Reich and to build our entire German spiritual, cultural and
social life on the indestructible foundation of our race. We
started a gigantic battle in 1919 * * * It took all the self-confidence
of German manhood to withstand and to triumph—in
this fight to substitute the German spirit for Jewish
corruption over the concerted attacks of powerful world
groups of which Jewry is a representative.</p>

<p>“Particularly we National Socialist Jurists have a mission
of our own to accomplish in this battle. We construct German
law on the foundations of old and vital elements of the
German people. * * *
<span class='pageno' title='628' id='Page_628'></span></p>

<p>“It is so obvious that it hardly needs mentioning that any
participation whatsoever of the Jew in German law—be it in
a creative, interpretative, educational or critical capacity—is
impossible. The elimination of the Jews from German jurisprudence
is in no way due to hatred or envy but to the understanding
that the influence of the Jew on German life is essentially
a pernicious and harmful one and that in the interests
of the German people and to protect its future an unequivocal
boundary must be drawn between us and the Jews.”
(<span class='it'>2536-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As the leading Nazi jurist, Frank accepted and promoted the
system of concentration camps and of arrest without warrant.
In an article on “Legislation and Judiciary in the Third Reich”
published in the Journal of the Academy of German Law in 1936,
Frank explained:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“To the world we are blamed again and again because of the
concentration camps. We are asked, ‘Why do you arrest
without a warrant of arrest?’ I say, put yourselves into the
position of our nation. Don’t forget that the very great and
still untouched world of Bolshevism cannot forget that we
have made final victory for them impossible in Europe, right
here on German soil.” (<span class='it'>2533-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Just as the other conspirators mobilized the military, economic,
and diplomatic resources of Germany for war, Frank, in the field
of legal policy, geared the German juridical machine for a war
of aggression, which, as he explained in 1942 to the NSDAP
District <span class='it'>Standortsfuehrung</span> Galicia at a mass meeting in Lemberg,
had for its purpose:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * to expand the living space for our people in a
natural manner”. (<span class='it'>2233-S-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Frank was proud of this accomplishment. In a speech before the
Academy of German Law in November 1939, he stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Today we are proud to have formulated our legal principles
from the very beginning in such a way that they need not be
changed in the case of war. For the rule, that right is that
which is useful to the nation, and wrong is that which harms
it, which stood at the beginning of our legal work, and which
established this collective term of nation as the only standard
of value of the law—this rule dominates also the law of these
times.” (<span class='it'>3445-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='629' id='Page_629'></span></p>

<h3>C. <span class='it'>THROUGH USE OF HIS OFFICE AS GOVERNOR GENERAL, FRANK PARTICIPATED IN THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT WAR CRIMES AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY IN THE TERRITORY OF THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT OF POLAND.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Certain of the war crimes and crimes against humanity committed
by the Nazi conspirators, and in particular by Frank in
the General Government of Poland are discussed in Chapter X on
the Slave Labor Program, Chapter XI on Concentration Camps,
Chapter XII on Persecution of the Jews, and Chapter XIII on
Germanization and Spoliation. This section will attempt to trace
Frank’s special responsibility, as Governor General, for the policies
underlying the crimes committed in the General Government
during the period of his administration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frank was appointed Governor General of the Occupied Polish
Territories by a Hitler decree dated 12 October 1939. The scope
of his executive power was defined as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Section 1. The territories occupied by German troops shall
be subject to the authority of the Governor General of the
occupied Polish territories, except insofar as they are incorporated
within the German Reich.</p>

<p>“Section 2. (1) I appoint Reich Minister Dr. Frank as Governor
General of the occupied Polish territories. (2) As
Deputy Governor General I appoint Reich Minister Dr. Seyss-Inquart.</p>

<p>“Section 3. (1) The Governor General shall be directly responsible
to me. (2) All branches of the administration shall
be directed by the Governor General * * *.”(<span class='it'>2537-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The jurisdiction and functions of Frank in the General Government
are described by him in several passages of his diary. For
example at a meeting of Department Heads of the General Government
on 8 March 1940 in the <span class='it'>Bergakademie</span>, Frank clarified his
status as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“One thing is certain. The authority of General Government
as the representative of the Fuehrer and the will of the
Reich in this territory is certainly strong, and I have always
emphasized that I would not tolerate the misuse of this authority.
I have allowed this to be known anew at every office
in Berlin, especially after Herr Field Marshall Goering
on 12.2.1940 from Karin-hall had forbidden all Administrative
Offices of the Reich, including the Police and even the
<span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>, to interfere in administrative matters of the
General Government * * *.
<span class='pageno' title='630' id='Page_630'></span></p>

<p>“There is no authority here in the General Government which
is higher as to rank, influence, and authority than that of
the Governor General. Even the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> has no governmental
or official functions of any kind in this connection; it
has only security functions and general military duties—it
has no political power whatsoever. The same applies here to
the Police and SS. There is here no state within a state but
we are the representatives of the Fuehrer and of the Reich.
In final conclusion, this applies also to the Party which has
here no far-reaching influence except for the fact that very
old members of the National Socialist Party and loyal veterans
of the Fuehrer take care of general matters.” (<span class='it'>2233-M-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At a conference of the District <span class='it'>Standartenfuehrer</span> of the
NSDAP in Cracow on 18 March 1942, Frank explained the relationship
between his administration and Himmler:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“As you know I am a fanatic as to unity in administration.
* * * It is therefore clear that the Higher SS and Police
Officer is subordinated to me, that the Police is a component
of the government, that the SS and Police Officer in the district
is subordinated to the Governor, and that the <span class='it'>Kreis</span>
[district] chief has the authority of command over the gendarmerie
in his <span class='it'>Kreis</span> [district]. This the Reichsfuehrer SS
has recognized; in the written agreement all these points are
mentioned word for word and signed. It is also self-evident
that we cannot set up a closed shop here which can be treated
in the traditional manner of small states. It would, for instance,
be ridiculous if we would build up here a security
policy of our own against our Poles in the country, while
knowing that the Polacks in West Prussia, in Posen, in Wartheland
and in Silesia have one and the same movement of
resistance. The Reichsfuehrer SS and Chief of the German
Police thus must be able to carry out with the aid of his agencies
his police measures concerning the interests of the Reich
as a whole. This, however, will be done in such a way that
the measures to be adopted will first be submitted to me and
carried out only when I give my consent. In the General Government,
the Police is the Armed Forces. As a result of this,
the leader of the Police system will be called by me into the
government of the General Government; he is subordinate to
me, or to my deputy, as a State Secretary for the Security
Systems.” (<span class='it'>2233-R-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pageno' title='631' id='Page_631'></span></p>

<h3>D. <span class='it'>THE PROTOCOL UNDER WHICH THE PURPOSES OF FRANK’S ADMINISTRATION OF THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT WERE DEFINED CONSTITUTES IN ITSELF A CRIMINAL PLAN OR CONSPIRACY.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>The protocol of the conversation between Keitel and Hitler,
which was dated 20 October 1939 and initialed by General Warlimont,
regarding “The Future Shape of Polish Relations with Germany”
provided in part as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“(1) The Armed Forces will welcome it if they can dispose of
Administrative questions in Poland.</p>

<p>“On principle there cannot be two administrations.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“(3) It is not the task of the Administration to make Poland
into a model province or a model state of the German order
or to put her economically or financially on a sound basis.</p>

<p>“The Polish intelligentsia must be prevented from forming a
ruling class. The standard of living in the country is to remain
low; we only want to draw labor forces from there. Poles
are also to be used for the administration of the country.
However the forming of national political groups may
not be allowed.</p>

<p>“(4) The administration has to work on its own responsibility
and must not be dependent on Berlin. We don’t want to
do there what we do in the Reich. The responsibility does
not rest with the Berlin Ministries since there is no German
administrative unit concerned.</p>

<p>“The accomplishment of this task will involve a hard racial
struggle [<span class='it'>Volkstumskampf</span>] which will not allow any legal
restrictions. The methods will be incompatible with the principles
otherwise adhered to by us.</p>

<p>“The Governor General is to give the Polish nation only bare
living conditions and is to maintain the basis for military
security.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“(6) * * * Any tendencies towards the consolidation of
conditions in Poland are to be suppressed. The ‘Polish muddle’
[<span class='it'>polnische Wirtschaft</span>] must be allowed to develop. The
government of the territory must make it possible for us to
purify the <span class='it'>Reich territory</span> from Jews and Polacks, too. Collaboration
with new Reich provinces (Posen and West Prussia)
only for <span class='it'>resettlements</span> (Compare Mission Himmler).</p>

<p>“<span class='it'>Purpose</span>: Shrewdness and severity must be the maxims in
<span class='pageno' title='632' id='Page_632'></span>
this racial struggle in order to spare us from going to battle
on account of this country again.” (<span class='it'>864-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Frank’s own statements regarding the purposes of his administration
in Poland should be considered in connection with the foregoing
document. The economic and political responsibilities
which had been conferred on Frank by Hitler, and according to
which he “<span class='it'>intended to administer Poland</span>”, were explained by
Frank as follows in an interview that took place on 3 October
1939:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Poland can only be administered by utilizing the country
through means of ruthless exploitation, deportation of all
supplies, raw materials, machines, factory installations, etc.,
which are important for the German war economy, availability
of all workers for work within Germany, reduction of
the entire Polish economy to absolute minimum necessary
for bare existence of the population, closing of all educational
institutions, especially technical schools and colleges in order
to prevent the growth of the new Polish intelligentsia. ‘Poland
shall be treated as a colony; the Poles shall be the slaves of
the Greater German World Empire.’ ” (<span class='it'>EC-344-16 &amp; 17</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Hitler-Keitel protocol should also be construed in the light
of various passages in Frank’s diary relating to German policy
in Poland. Illegality had been made in effect a canon of administration
by the protocol, which provided that Frank’s task involved
“a hard racial struggle which will not allow any legal restrictions.”
Frank emphasized this point to his Department Heads
at a conference on 19 December 1940:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * In this country the force of a determined leadership
must rule. The Pole must feel here that we are not
building him a legal state, but that for him there is only one
duty, namely, to work and to behave himself. It is clear that
this leads sometimes to difficulties, but you must, in your own
interest, see that all measures are ruthlessly carried out in
order to become master of the situation. You can rely on me
absolutely in this.” (<span class='it'>2233-O-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It was the German purpose from the beginning to administer
the General Government as colonial territory in total disregard of
the duties imposed by International Law on an occupying power,
and Frank’s administrative policies were shaped in accordance
with this policy. At the first conference with Department Heads
of the General Government on 2 December 1939, Frank stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Decisive in the administrative activities of the General Government
<span class='pageno' title='633' id='Page_633'></span>
is the will of the Fuehrer that this area shall be the
first colonial territory of the German nation.” (<span class='it'>2233-K-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The “hard racial struggle” which Keitel and Hitler agreed
could be solved only if attacked without “legal restrictions,” developed
into the struggle which had as its ultimate purpose the
Germanization of the General Government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frank’s adherence to the conspirators’ Germanization policy
was clearly expressed by him at an official meeting of political
leaders of the NSDAP in Cracow on 5 August 1942. Frank
explained on that occasion:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The situation in regard to Poland is unique insofar as on
the one hand—I speak quite openly—we must expand Germanism
in such a manner that the area of the General Government
becomes pure German colonized land at some decades
to come; and, on the other hand under the present war conditions
we have to allow foreign racial groups to perform
here the work which must be carried out in the service of
Greater Germany.” (<span class='it'>2233-V-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Expediency, and expediency only, tempered Frank’s treatment
of the nonGerman population of the General Government in the
“hard racial struggle” he was charged with administering. The
General Government was destined to become “pure German colonized
land”, the valley of the Vistula to be as “German as the
valley of the Rhine.” (<span class='it'>2233-H-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for the Poles and Ukrainians, Frank’s attitude was clear.
They were to be permitted to work for the German economy as
long as the war emergency continued. Once the war was won,
he told the District <span class='it'>Standortfuehrung</span> and Political Leaders at
a conference at Cracow on 14 January 1944:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * then, for all I care, mincemeat [<span class='it'>Hackfleisch</span>] can
be made of the Poles and the Ukrainians and all the others
who run around here—it does not matter what happens.”
(<span class='it'>2233-BB-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<h3>E. <span class='it'>FRANK ADVOCATED AND ADMINISTERED A PROGRAM OF EXTERMINATING JEWS OF POLISH NATIONALITY WITHIN THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Frank’s diary makes it clear that the complete annihilation of
Jews, in accordance with the racial program of the Nazi conspirators,
was one of the objectives of his administration as
Governor General. In the fall of 1940 Frank urged German
soldiers to reassure their families in Germany with regard to
the hardships of life in the General Government:
<span class='pageno' title='634' id='Page_634'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In all these weeks, they [i.e., your families] will be thinking
of you, saying to themselves: My God, there he sits in
Poland where there are so many lice and Jews, perhaps he
is hungry and cold, perhaps he is afraid to write. * * *
It would not be a bad idea then to send our dear ones back
home a picture, and tell them: well now, there are not so
many lice and Jews any more, and conditions here in the
Government General have changed and improved somewhat
already. Of course, I could not eliminate all lice and Jews
in only one year’s time (public amused). But in the course
of time, and above all, if you help me, this end will be attained.
After all, it is not necessary for us to accomplish
everything within a year and right away, for what would
otherwise be left for those who follow us to do?” (<span class='it'>2233-C-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A year later at a Cabinet Session of 16 December 1941 Frank
restated the official policy of his administration with respect to
Jews:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“As far as the Jews are concerned, I want to tell you quite
frankly, that they must be done away with in one way or
another. The Fuehrer said once: should united Jewry again
succeed in provoking a world war, the blood of not only the
nations which have been forced into the war by them, will
be shed, but the Jew will have found his end in Europe
* * *.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, I must ask you to rid yourselves of all feeling
of pity. We must annihilate the Jews, wherever we find
them and wherever it is possible, in order to maintain here
the structure of the Reich as a whole. This will, naturally,
be achieved by other methods than those pointed out by
Bureau Chief Dr. Hummel. Nor can the judges of the Special
Courts be made responsible for it, because of the limitations
of the framework of the legal procedure. Such out-dated
views cannot be applied to such gigantic and unique
events. We must find at any rate, a way which leads to
the goal, and my thoughts are working in that direction.</p>

<p>“The Jews represent for us also extraordinarily malignant
gluttons. We have now approximately 2,500,000 of them in
the General Government, perhaps with the Jewish mixtures
and everything that goes with it, 3,500,000 Jews. We cannot
shoot or poison those 3,500,000 Jews, but we shall nevertheless
be able to take measures, which will lead, somehow, to
their annihilation, and this in connection with the gigantic
measures to be determined in discussions from the Reich.
<span class='pageno' title='635' id='Page_635'></span>
The General Government must become free of Jews, the
same as the Reich. Where and how this is to be achieved
is a matter for the offices which we must appoint and create
here. Their activities will be brought to your attention in
due course.” (<span class='it'>2233-D-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>An earlier passage in the report of this session of the Cabinet
explains the references to Dr. Hummel. Hummel had complained
that legal formalities were obstructing the process of liquidation:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“In Warsaw, in spite of the setting up of a third court chamber,
we have been able to decree only 45 death sentences, only
8 of which have been carried out, since in each individual
case, the Pardon Commission [<span class='it'>Gnadenkommission</span>] in Cracow
has to make the final decision. A further 600 sentences
were demanded and are under consideration. An effective
isolation of the ghetto is not possible by way of the Special
Court Procedure. The procedure to be followed up to the
liquidation takes too much time; it is burdened with too
many formalities and must be simplified.” (<span class='it'>2233-Q-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Frank himself ordered that every Jew seen outside the Ghetto
should be executed:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Severe measures must and will be adopted against Jews
leaving the Ghettos. Death sentences pending against Jews
for this reason must be carried out as quickly as possible.
This order according to which every Jew found outside the
Ghetto is to be executed, must be carried out without fail.”
(<span class='it'>2233-Q-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>When ways and means of meeting the food deficit in the General
Government created by the increase in quotas to be requisitioned
for export to Germany were discussed in August 1942,
Frank approved a program which provided in part as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The feeding of a Jewish population, estimated heretofore
at 1.5 million, drops off to an estimated total of 300,000
Jews, who still work for German interests as craftsmen or
otherwise. For these the Jewish rations, including certain
special allotments which have proved necessary for the maintenance
of working capacity, will be retained. The other
Jews, a total of 1.2 million, will no longer be provided with
foodstuffs.” (<span class='it'>2233-E-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Frank’s concurrence was expressed in the following terms:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“That we sentence 1.2 million Jews to die of hunger should
be noted only marginally. It is a matter of course that should
the Jews not starve it would, we hope, result in speeding up
anti-Jewish measures.” (<span class='it'>2233-E-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pageno' title='636' id='Page_636'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>At an official meeting of the political leaders of the NSDAP
on 5 August 1942, Frank made the following progress report:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“What a dirty people made up of Jews swaggered around
here before 1939! And where are the Jews today? You
scarcely see them. If you see them they are working.”
(<span class='it'>2233-V-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In December 1941, Frank had pointed out that his administration
could not shoot or poison all the three and a half million
Jews in the General Government. He had promised, however,
that he would be able to devise measures which would lead to
their annihilation. Two years later, at a special press conference
in January 1944, he was able to report that his mission was
almost accomplished.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“At the present time we have still in the General Government
perhaps 100,000 Jews.” (<span class='it'>2233-F-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<h3>F. <span class='it'>FRANK IMPOSED UPON THE POPULATION OF THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT A REIGN OF TERROR, OPPRESSION, IMPOVERISHMENT, AND STARVATION.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>What had happened in the General Government in the first
three and a half years of Frank’s administration was summarized
by Frank in a report to Hitler on the situation in Poland, dated
19 June 1943:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“In the course of time, a series of measures or of consequences
of the German rule have led to a substantial <span class='it'>deterioration
of the attitude</span> of the entire Polish people in the
German Government. These measures have affected either
individual professions or the entire population and frequently
also—often with crushing severity—the fate of individuals.</p>

<p>“Among these are in particular:</p>

<p>“1—The entirely insufficient nourishment of the population,
mainly of the working classes in the cities, whose majority
is working for German interests.</p>

<p>“Until the war of 1939, its food supplies, though not varied,
were sufficient and generally secure, due to the agrarian
surplus of the former Polish state and in spite of the negligence
on the part of their former political leadership.</p>

<p>“2—The confiscation of a great part of the Polish estates
and the expropriation without compensation and resettlement
of Polish peasants from manoeuvre areas and from German
settlements.</p>

<p>“3—Encroachments and confiscations in the industries, in
commerce and trade and in the field of private property.
<span class='pageno' title='637' id='Page_637'></span></p>

<p>“4—Mass arrests and mass shootings by the German police
who applied the system of collective responsibility.</p>

<p>“5—The rigorous methods of recruiting workers.</p>

<p>“6—The extensive paralyzation of cultural life.</p>

<p>“7—The closing of high schools, junior colleges, and universities.</p>

<p>“8—The limitation, indeed the complete elimination of Polish
influence from all spheres of State administration.</p>

<p>“9—Curtailment of the influence of the Catholic Church,
limiting its extensive influence—an undoubtedly necessary
move—and, in addition, until quite recently, the closing and
confiscation of monasteries, schools and charitable institutions.”
(<span class='it'>437-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In order to illustrate how completely Frank as Governor General
is identified with the criminal policies whose execution is reported
in the foregoing document, and the extent to which they
were the official policies of his administration, it is proposed to
annotate several of the items with passages from Frank’s own
diary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Undernourishment of Polish population.</span> The extent of the
undernourishment of the Polish population was reported to Frank
in September 1941 by <span class='it'>Obermedizinalrat</span> Dr. Walbaum:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>Obermedizinalrat</span> Dr. Walbaum expresses his opinion of the
<span class='it'>health condition</span> of the Polish population. Investigations
which were carried out by his department proved that the
majority of Poles eat only about 600 calories, whereas the
normal requirement for a human being is 2,200 calories. The
Polish population was enfeebled to such an extent that it
would fall an easy prey to <span class='it'>spotted fever</span>. The number of diseased
Poles amounted today already to 40%. During the last
week alone 1000 new spotted fever cases have been officially
recorded. * * * If the food rations were to be diminished
again, an enormous increase of the number of illnesses
could be predicted.” (<span class='it'>2233-P-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It was clear from this report that starvation was prevalent in
the General Government. Nevertheless, in August 1942, Frank
approved a new plan which called for much larger contributions
of foodstuffs to Germany at the expense of the nonGerman population
of the General Government. Methods of meeting the new
quotas out of the already grossly inadequate rations of the General
Government, and the impact of the new quotas on the economy
of the country were discussed at a Cabinet meeting of the
General Government, on 18 August 1942 in terms which leave no
<span class='pageno' title='638' id='Page_638'></span>
doubt that not only was the proposed requisition far beyond the
resources of the country, but its impact was to be distributed on
a discriminatory basis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frank’s opening remarks at this meeting defined the scope of
the problem and its solution:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Before the German people are to experience starvation, the
occupied territories and their people shall be exposed to starvation.
In this moment therefore we here in the General
Government must also have the iron determination to help
the Great German people, our Fatherland.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The General
Government therefore must do the following: The General
Government has taken on the obligation to send 500,000 tons
bread grains to the Fatherland in addition to the foodstuffs
already being delivered for the relief of Germany or consumed
here by troops of the armed forces, Police or SS. If
you compare this with our contributions of last year you can
see that this means a six fold increase over that of last year’s
contribution of the General Government. The new demand
will be fulfilled exclusively at <span class='it'>the expense of the foreign population</span>.
It must be done cold-bloodedly and without pity;
* * *” (<span class='it'>2233-E-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>President of the Main Department for Food and Agriculture
Naumann (apparently an official of the General Government)
then described how the reduced quantity of food available for
feeding the population of the General Government should be distributed:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The feeding of a <span class='it'>Jewish population</span>, estimated heretofore at
1.5 million, drops off to an estimated total of 300,000 Jews,
who still work for German interests as craftsmen or otherwise.
For these the Jewish rations, including certain special
allotments which have proved necessary for the maintenance
of working capacity, will be retained. The other Jews, a
total of 1.2 million, will no longer be provided with foodstuffs.</p>

<p>“<span class='it'>Non-German normal consumers</span> will receive, from 1 January
1943 to 1 March 1943, instead of 4.2 kg. bread per month,
2.8 kg; from 1 March 1943 to 30 July 1943 the total bread
ration for these non-German normal consumers will be cancelled.</p>

<p>“<span class='it'>Those entitled to be supplied</span> [<span class='it'>Versorgungsberechtigten</span>] are
composed as follows. We estimate that 3 million persons
come into consideration as war workers, the A-&nbsp;and B-card
holders and their kin, and that somewhat more than 3 million
<span class='pageno' title='639' id='Page_639'></span>
persons are non-German normal consumers, who do not
work directly or indirectly in the interests of Germany. The
war workers, A-&nbsp;and B-card holders and their families, about
3 million persons, will however continue to be supplied, up
to the harvest of 1943, at the prevailing rates.” (<span class='it'>2233-E-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Naumann goes on to discuss the difficulties that may be encountered
in the process of requisition:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“<span class='it'>The securing of all depots and food processing plants</span>, as
well as their transport facilities must be assured, as otherwise
irreplaceable losses result which mean a further burdening
of the food budget. I have had maps made of all districts
[<span class='it'>Kreise</span>] on which the depots have all been drawn in. I
request that the necessary measures be taken on the part of
the police and these depots, which are in the eye of the hungering
masses, above all at times when the restrictions are
carried out, should be strictly guarded, so that the meager
supplies which we have until the new harvest should not be
destroyed by sabotage or arson.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Finally it must be determined
at the beginning of November whether the <span class='it'>martial
law for the harvest period</span>, which has been proclaimed up to
30 November, must be extended to 30 December. Martial
law for the harvest period has been extended to all products
which are to be seized. The planned quota increase and reduction
of ration quantities must be kept secret under all
circumstances and may be published only at that time which
the Main Department for Food and Agriculture considers
proper. Should the reduction of ration quantities and the increase
of quotas become known earlier, extremely noticeable
disturbances in the seizure would take place. The mass of
the Polish population would then go to the land and would
become a supplementary competitor of our requisitioning
agencies.” (<span class='it'>2233-E-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Frank’s concluding remarks summarized the position as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I must point out that some sectors of the administration
will feel this very keenly. In the first place the <span class='it'>police</span> will
feel this, for it will have to deal, if I may say so, with an increased
activity of the black market and a neglect of food
customs. I will gladly give the police extraordinary powers
so that they can overcome these difficulties.</p>

<p>“The economy will feel it. The decrease of work rendered
will become felt in all sectors, branches and regions. I also
assume that our <span class='it'>transport system</span> will feel it too. In view of
the worsening living conditions an extraordinary hardship
<span class='pageno' title='640' id='Page_640'></span>
will set in for railroad workers and other categories; as the
previous quantities of food were already not enough. The
monopolies will feel it through a decrease of their incomes,
as the amounts of potatoes available for the production of
vodka will be less.</p>

<p>“The <span class='it'>Germans</span> in this area shall not feel it. We wish in spite
of this new plan to see to it that the supplies for Germans
will be maintained. Also the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> and other encamped
units in this area shall not feel it. We hope that it
will be possible for us to keep up the whole quotas here.</p>

<p>“To help in this necessity there is a corresponding measure,
namely that the supervision of persons traveling from the
General Government to the Reich, above all of military personnel,
in order to see whether they are <span class='it'>taking food out</span> of
the General Government, should be suspended. This means
that in addition to all that which we must now extract from
the land economically, there must take place a complete removal
of control over that which is dragged out of the land
by thousands upon thousands—doubtless illegally and against
our government measures.” (<span class='it'>2233-E-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The extent of the General Government’s food contribution to
the Reich, and its significance in terms of rations within Germany
were described by Frank at a meeting of political leaders of the
NSDAP in December 1942 at Cracow:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I will endeavor to get out of the reservoir of this territory
everything that is yet to be got out of it. When you consider
that it was possible for me to deliver to the Reich 600,000
tons of bread grain, and in addition 180,000 tons to the
Armed Forces stationed here; further an abundance amounting
to many thousands of tons of other commodities such as
seed, fats, vegetables, besides the delivery to the Reich of
300 million eggs, etc.—you can estimate the significance of
the consignment from the General Government of 600,000
tons of bread grain; you are referred to the fact that the
General Government by this achievement alone covers the
raising of the bread ration in the Greater German Reich by
two-thirds during the present rationing period. This enormous
achievement can rightfully be claimed by us.”
(<span class='it'>2233-Z-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Resettlement projects.</span> Although Himmler was given general
authority in connection with the conspirators’ program to
resettle various districts in the conquered Eastern territories with
racial Germans, projects relating to resettling districts in the
<span class='pageno' title='641' id='Page_641'></span>
General Government were submitted to and approved by Frank.
On 4 August 1942, for example, the plan to resettle Zamosc and
Lublin was reported to him by State Secretary Krueger:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“State Secretary Krueger then continues, saying that the
Reichsfuehrer’s next immediate plan until the end of the following
year would be to settle the following German racial groups in
the two districts (Zamosc and Lublin): 1000 peasant settlements
(1 settlement per family of about 6) for Bosnian Germans; 1200
other kinds of settlements; 1000 settlements for Bessarabian Germans;
200 for Serbian Germans; 2000 for Leningrad Germans;
4000 for Baltic Germans; 500 for Wolhynia Germans; and 200
settlements for Flemish, Danish and Dutch Germans: in all 10,000
settlements for 50,000 persons” (<span class='it'>2233-T-PS</span>). Frank directed
that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * the resettlement plan is to be discussed cooperatively
by the competent authorities and declared his willingness
to approve the final plan by the end of September
after satisfactory arrangements had been made concerning
all the questions appertaining thereto (in particular the
guaranteeing of peace and order) so that by the middle of
November, as the most favorable time, the resettlement can
begin.” (<span class='it'>2233-T-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The way in which the resettlement at Zamosc was carried out
was described to Frank at a meeting at Warsaw on 25 January
1943 by State Secretary Krueger:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“When we settled about the first 4000 in Kreis Zamosc
shortly before Christmas I had an opportunity to speak to
these people. * * * It is understandable that in resettling
this area .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we did not make friends of the Poles.
* * * In colonizing this territory with racial Germans,
we are forced to chase out the Poles. * * * We are removing
those who constitute a burden in this new colonization
territory. Actually, they are the asocial and inferior
elements. They are being deported, first brought to a concentration
camp, and then sent as labor to the Reich. From
a Polish propaganda standpoint this entire first action has
had an unfavorable effect. For the Poles say: After the
Jews have been destroyed then they will employ the same
methods to get the Poles out of this territory and liquidate
them just like the Jews.” (<span class='it'>2233-AA-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Although the illegality of this dispossession of Poles to make
room for German settlers was clear, and although the fact that
the Poles were not only being dispossessed but taken off to concentration
<span class='pageno' title='642' id='Page_642'></span>
camps was drawn to Frank’s attention at this time, he
merely directed that individual cases of resettlement should in
future be discussed in the same manner as in the case of Zamosc.
(<span class='it'>2233-AA-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Encroachments and confiscations in the industries and in
the field of private property.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Frank explained his policy in respect to Polish property to his
Department Heads in the following terms in December 1939:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Principally it can be said regarding the administration of
the General Government: This territory in its entirety is
booty of the German Reich, and it thus cannot be permitted
that this territory shall be exploited in its individual parts
but that the territory in its entirety shall be economically
used and its entire economic worth redound to the benefit of
the German people.” (<span class='it'>2233-K-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Whatever encroachments there were on private property rights
in the General Government fell squarely within the policy which
Frank in an interview on 3 October 1939 stated he intended to
administer as General Governor:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Poland can only be administered by utilizing the country
through means of ruthless exploitation, deportation of all
supplies, raw materials, machines, factory installations etc.
which are important for the German war economy. * * *
[It was Frank’s opinion] that the war would be a short one
and that it was most important now to make available as
soon as possible raw materials, machines and workers to the
German industry, which was short in all of these. Most important,
however, in Frank’s opinion, was the fact that by
destroying Polish industry, its subsequent reconstruction
after the war would become more difficult, if not impossible,
so that Poland would be reduced to its proper position as an
agrarian country which would have to depend upon Germany
for importation of industrial products.” (<span class='it'>EC-344-16
&amp; 17</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The basic decree under which property in the General Government
was sequestered was promulgated by Frank on 24 January
1940. This decree authorized sequestration in connection with
the “performance of tasks serving the public interest,” the
seizure of “abandoned property,” and the liquidation of “antisocial
or financially unremunerative property.” It permitted the
Higher S.S. and Police Chief to order sequestrations “with the
object of increasing the striking power of the units of the uniformed
police and armed S.S.” No legal recourse was granted
<span class='pageno' title='643' id='Page_643'></span>
for losses arising from the enforcement of the decree, compensation
being solely in the discretion of an official of the General
Government. It is clear that the undefined criteria of this decree
empowered Nazi officials in the General Government to engage in
wholesale seizure of property. (<span class='it'>2540-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>Principle of collective responsibility.</span> It was no part of
Frank’s policy in administering the General Government that reprisals
should be commensurate with the gravity of the offense.
Frank was, on the contrary, an advocate of drastic measures in
dealing with the Polish people. At a conference of Department
Heads of the General Government on 19 January 1940, he explained:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“My relationship with the Poles is like the relationship between
ant and plant louse. When I treat the Poles in a
helpful way, so to speak tickle them in a friendly manner,
then I do it in the expectation that their work performance
redounds to my benefit. This is not a political but a purely
tactical-technical problem. * * * In cases where in spite
of all these measures the performance does not increase, or
where the slightest act gives me occasion to step in, I would
not even hesitate to take the most draconic action.” (<span class='it'>2233-L-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At a subsequent meeting of Department Heads on 8 March
1940 Frank became even more explicit:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Whenever there is the least-attempt by the Poles to start
anything, an enormous campaign of destruction will follow.
Then I would not mind starting a regime of terror, or fear
its consequences.” (<span class='it'>2233-M-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At a conference of District Standartenfuehrer at Cracow on 18
March 1942 Frank reiterated his policy:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Incidentally, the struggle for the achievement of our aims
will be pursued cold bloodedly. You see how the state agencies
work. You see that we do not hesitate before anything,
and stand whole dozens of people up against the wall. This
is necessary because here simple consideration says that it
cannot be our task at this period when the best German
blood is being sacrificed, to show regard for the blood of
another race. For out of this one of the greatest dangers
may arise. One already hears today in Germany that
prisoners-of-war, for instance with us in Bavaria or in
Thuringia, are administering large estates entirely independently,
while all the men in a village fit for service are
at the front. If this state of affairs continues then a gradual
<span class='pageno' title='644' id='Page_644'></span>
retrogression of Germanism will show itself. One should
not underestimate this danger. Therefore, everything revealing
itself as a Polish power of leadership must be destroyed
again and again with ruthless energy. This does
not have to be shouted abroad, it will happen silently.”
(<span class='it'>2233-R-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And on 15 January 1944 Frank assured the political leaders of
the NSDAP at Cracow:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I have not been hesitant in declaring that when a German
is shot, up to 100 Poles shall be shot too.” (<span class='it'>2233-BB-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(5) <span class='it'>Rigorous methods of recruiting workers.</span> Force, violence,
and economic duress were all advocated by Frank as means for
recruiting laborers for deportation to slave labor in Germany.
Deportation of Polish laborers to Germany was an integral part
of the program announced by Frank for his administration of the
General Government (See <span class='it'>EC-344-16 &amp; 17</span>), and as Governor
General he authorized whatever degree of force was required for
the execution of his program.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Voluntary methods of recruitment soon proved inadequate. In
the spring of 1940 the question of utilizing force came up, and
the following discussion took place in the presence of Seyss-Inquart:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Governor-General stated that the fact that all means
in form of proclamations etc. did not bring success, leads to
the conclusion that the Poles out of malevolence, and guided
by the intention of harming Germany by not putting themselves
at its disposal, refuse to enlist for working duty.
Therefore, he asks Dr. Frauendorfer, if there are any other
measures, not as yet employed, to win the Poles on a voluntary
basis.</p>

<p>“<span class='it'>Reichshauptamtsleiter</span> Dr. Frauendorfer answered this
question negatively.</p>

<p>“The General Governor emphasized the fact that he now
will be asked to take a definite attitude toward this question.
Therefore the question will arise whether any form
of <span class='it'>coercive measures</span> should now be employed.</p>

<p>“The question put by the General Governor to SS Lieutenant
General [<span class='it'>Obergruppenfuehrer</span>] Krueger: does he see possibilities
of calling Polish workers by coercive means, is answered
in the affirmative by SS Lieutenant General <span class='it'>Krueger</span>.”
(<span class='it'>2233-N-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At the same conference Frank declared that he was willing to
agree to any practical measures, and decreed that unemployment
<span class='pageno' title='645' id='Page_645'></span>
compensation should be discontinued on 1 May 1940 as a means
of recruiting labor for Germany.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The General Governor is willing to agree to any practical
measure; however, he wishes to be informed personally
about the measures to be taken. One measure, which no
doubt would be successful, would be the <span class='it'>discontinuance of
unemployment compensation</span> for unemployed workers and
their <span class='it'>transfer to public welfare</span>. Therefore, he decrees that,
beginning <span class='it'>1 May</span>, claim for unemployment compensation will
cease to exist and only public welfare may be granted. For
the time being only men are to report and above those men
living in cities. There might be a possibility of combining
the moving of the 120,000 Poles from the Warthe district
with this measure.” (<span class='it'>2233-N-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In March 1940 Frank assured the authorities in Berlin that he
was prepared to have villages surrounded and the people dragged
forcibly out. He reported that, in the course of his negotiations
in Berlin regarding the urgent demand for larger numbers of
Polish farm workers, he had stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * if it is demanded from him, [he] could naturally
exercise force in such a manner, that he has the police surround
a village and get the men and women in question out
by force, and then send them to Germany. But one can
also work differently, besides these police measures, by retaining
the unemployment compensation of these workers in
question.” (<span class='it'>2233-B-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At a conference of Department Heads of the General Government
on 10 May 1940 Frank laid down the following principles
for dealing with the problem of conscription labor:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Upon the demands from the Reich it has now been decreed
that compulsion may be exercised in view of the fact that
sufficient manpower was not voluntarily available for service
inside the German Reich. This compulsion means the possibility
of arrest of male and female Poles.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The arrest
of young Poles when leaving church services or the cinema
would bring about an ever-increasing nervousness of the
Poles. Generally speaking, he had no objection at all if the
rubbish, capable of work yet often loitering about, would
be snatched from the streets. The best method for this,
however, would be the organization of a raid, and it would
be absolutely justifiable to stop a Pole in the street and to
question him what he was doing, where he was working, etc.”
(<span class='it'>2233-A-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pageno' title='646' id='Page_646'></span></p>

<p>Frank utilized starvation as a method of recruitment. At a
conference on 20 November 1942 the following plan was agreed:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Starting 1 February 1942 the food ration cards should
not be issued to the individual Pole or Ukrainian by the
Nutrition Office [<span class='it'>Ernaehrungsamt</span>], but to the establishments
working for the German interest. 2,000,000 people would
thus be eliminated from the non-German, normal ration-consuming
contingent. Now, if those ration cards are only
distributed by the factories, part of those people will naturally
rush into the factories. Labor could then be either
procured for Germany from them or they could be used for
the most important work in the factories of the General
Government.” (<span class='it'>2233-Y-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 18 August 1942 Frank informed Sauckel that the General
Government had already supplied 800,000 laborers to Germany,
and that a further 140,000 would be supplied by the end of the
year. Regarding the quota for the next year he promised:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * you can, however, next year reckon upon a higher
number of workers from the General Government, for we
shall employ the Police to conscript them.” (<span class='it'>2233-W-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Six months after Frank promised Sauckel to resort to police
action to round up labor for deportation to Germany, the Chairman
of the Ukrainian Main Committee reported to Frank that
the program was being carried out as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The wild and ruthless man-hunt carried on everywhere
in towns and country, in streets, squares, stations, even in
churches, at night in houses, has badly shaken the feeling
of security of the inhabitants. Everybody is exposed to the
danger of being seized anywhere and at any time by members
of the police, suddenly and unexpectedly, and being
brought into an assembly camp. None of his relatives knows
what has happened to him, only weeks or months later, one
or the other gives news of his fate by a postcard.” (<span class='it'>1526-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(6) <span class='it'>Closing of schools.</span> The program outlined by Frank on
3 October 1939 as the program he intended to administer as Governor
General included:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“closing of all educational institutions, especially technical
schools and colleges in order to prevent the growth of the
new Polish intelligentsia.” (<span class='it'>EC-344-16 &amp; 17</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This decision was taken by Frank before it was determined what
schools, if any, might be closed because of failure of instructors
to refrain from reference to politics, or refusal to submit to inspection
by the occupying authorities. Moreover, the policy was
<span class='pageno' title='647' id='Page_647'></span>
determined, as indicated, in furtherance of the purpose of preventing
the rise of an educated class in Poland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(7) <span class='it'>Other crimes.</span> There were other grounds for uneasiness in
Poland which Frank does not mention in his report to Hitler.
He does not mention the Concentration Camps—perhaps because,
as the “representative jurist” of National Socialism, Frank had
himself defended the system in Germany. As Governor General
Frank is responsible for all concentration camps within the
boundaries of the General Government. As indicated above, he
knew and approved that Poles were taken to concentration camps
in connection with the resettlement projects. He had certain
jurisdiction, as well, in relation to the notorious extermination
camp Auschwitz, to which Poles from the General Government
were committed by his administration, although the camp itself
lay outside the boundaries of the General Government. In February
1944, Ambassador Counsellor Dr. Schumberg suggested
a possible amnesty of Poles who had been taken to Auschwitz
for trivial offenses and kept for several months. The report of
the conference continues:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Governor General will take under consideration an amnesty
probably for 1 May of this year. Nevertheless, one
must not lose sight of the fact that the German leadership
of the General Government must not now show any signs of
weakness.” (<span class='it'>2233-BB-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<h3>G. <span class='it'>CONCLUSION.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>As legal adviser of Hitler and the leadership corps of the
NSDAP, Frank promoted the conspirators’ rise to power. In
his various juridical capacities, both in the NSDAP and in the
German government, Frank advocated and promoted the political
monopoly of the NSDAP, the racial program of the conspirators,
and the terror system of the concentration camp and of arrest
without warrant. His role in the common plan was to realize
“the National Socialist Program in the realm of law”, and to
give the outward form of legality to this program of terror,
persecution and oppression, which had as its ultimate purpose
mobilization for aggressive war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a loyal adherent of Hitler and the NSDAP, Frank was appointed
Governor General in October 1939 of that area of Poland
known as the General Government, which became the testing
ground for the conspirators’ program of “<span class='it'>Lebensraum</span>.” Frank
had defined justice in the field of German law as that which benefited
<span class='pageno' title='648' id='Page_648'></span>
the German nation. His five year administration of the
General Government illustrates the same principles applied in
the field of International Law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frank took the office of Governor General under a program
which constituted in itself a criminal plan or conspiracy, as Frank
well knew and approved, to exploit the territory ruthlessly for the
benefit of Nazi Germany, to conscript its nationals for labor in
Germany, to close its schools and colleges to prevent the rise of a
Polish intelligentsia, and to administer the territory as a colonial
possession of the Third Reich in total disregard of the duties of
an occupying power toward the inhabitants of occupied territory.
Under Frank’s administration this criminal plan was consummated.
But the execution went even beyond the plan. Food
contributions to Germany increased to the point where the bare
subsistence reserved for the General Government under the plan
was reduced to the level of mass starvation; a savage program
of exterminating Jews was relentlessly executed; resettlement
projects were carried out with reckless disregard of the rights of
the local population; the terror of the concentration camp followed
in the wake of the Nazi invaders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It has been shown that all of these crimes were committed in
accordance with the official policies established and advocated
by Frank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This summary of evidence has been compiled almost entirely
from statements by Frank himself, from the admissions found
in his diaries, official reports, records of his conferences with his
colleagues and subordinates, and his speeches. It is therefore
appropriate that a final passage from his diary should be quoted
in conclusion. In January 1943, Frank told his colleagues in the
General Government that their task would grow more difficult.
Hitler, he said, could only help them as a kind of “administrative
pillbox”. They must depend on themselves.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“We are now duty bound to hold together [he continued]
* * * We must remember that we who are gathered together
here figure on Mr. Roosevelt’s list of war criminals.
I have the honor of being Number One. We have, so to speak,
become accomplices in the world historic sense.” (<span class='it'>2233-AA-PS</span>)</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg653a'>9. WILHELM FRICK</h2>

<h3>A. <span class='it'>FRICK’S POLITICAL CAREER.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Frick’s important contribution to the Nazi conspiracy was in
the field of government administration. He was the administrative
brain who organized the German state for Nazism and who
geared the machinery of the state for aggressive war. It was
Frick who transformed the plans and programs of his fellow conspirators
into political action. He was the manager of the Nazi
conspiracy. He was entrusted with broad discretion, exercised
great power, and knew the criminal purpose of the acts he committed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conspiratorial activities of Frick cover a period of 25 years,
beginning as early as 1920 (<span class='it'>3086-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>A brief summary of Frick’s activities will show how extensive
was his contribution to the Nazi conspiracy. He took part in
Hitler’s Munich Beer Hall Putsch of November 1923, and was
sentenced for his participation. He helped Hitler become a German
citizen. To maintain the Nazi regime in the first 2 years of
its existence and to achieve some of its most important immediate
purposes, Frick signed 235 laws and decrees during that period,
most of which are published in the <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the first time in German history a uniform police system
for the whole German Reich was created. Frick was its creator
and its supreme head. He appointed the Gestapo chief, Heinrich
Himmler, Chief of the German Police. Frick was the highest
controlling authority over concentration camps. He personally
inspected these camps. His Ministry of the Interior made the
necessary legal arrangements for acquiring land for the
Auschwitz Concentration Camp. Through his Medical Division,
Frick controlled the Nazi asylums and so-called medical institutions
<span class='pageno' title='654' id='Page_654'></span>
in which forced sterilizations and murders of thousands of
Germans and of foreign laborers were carried out. The racial
legislation, including the Nurnberg Laws, was drafted by Frick
and administered under his jurisdiction. Frick introduced the
Yellow Star as a sign of stigmatization of the Jews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of his active participation in the Nazi conspiracy,
Frick occupied a number of important positions. Among
his Nazi Party positions are the following: member of the Nazi
Party from 1925 to 1945; Reich Leader of the Nazi Party from
1933 to 1945; floor leader of the Nazi Party in the Reichstag
from 1928 to 1945. His governmental positions were: chief of a
division of the Munich Police Department from 1917 to 10 November
1923, 2 days after Hitler’s Putsch; Nazi Minister of the
Interior and of Education in the German State of Thuringia
from January 1930 to April 1931; Reichsministerof the Interior
from 30 January 1933 to 20 August 1943; member of the Reich
Defense Council as General Plenipotentiary for the Administration
of the Reich from 21 May 1935 to 20 August 1943. On 20
August 1943, Frick was appointed Reich Protector of Bohemia
and Moravia, and he held this last position until 1945. (<span class='it'>2978-PS</span>)</p>

<h3>B. <span class='it'>FRICK’S PARTICIPATION IN PROMOTING THE NAZI CONSPIRATORS’ ACCESSION TO POWER.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Frick has admitted that he was one of the men who helped
Hitler to power (<span class='it'>3043-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Frick’s activities in early days of conspiracy.</span> In the very
beginning of the Nazi Party and its conspiracy, Frick misused
his various governmental positions in order to hold a “protecting
hand over the National-Socialist Party and Hitler.” This he
stated solemnly in his speech before the Munich People’s Court
during the Putsch trial (<span class='it'>3119-PS</span>; see “The Hitler Trial Before
the People’s Court in Munich” (<span class='it'>Der Hitler Prozess vor dem
Volksgericht in Muenchen</span>), published by Knorr &amp; Hirth,
G.M.B.H., Muenchen, 1924.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Hitler was arrested during those early revolutionary days,
Frick used his position in the Munich Police Department to release
him under his own authority (<span class='it'>3124-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frick participated in the Nazi Beer Hall Putsch of 8-9 November
1923, and was tried with Hitler on a charge of complicity
in treason. He was convicted and received a suspended sentence
of one year and three months in a fortress (<span class='it'>3132-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler’s appreciation of Frick’s assistance during those years
is demonstrated by the fact that Hitler honored Frick by mentioning
<span class='pageno' title='655' id='Page_655'></span>
his name in <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>, the Nazi bible. Only two other
defendants in this proceeding, Hess and Streicher, share that
honor. In this reference Hitler said of Frick:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“He [Munich Police President Poehner] and his coworker
Dr. Frick are in my estimation the only men in government
positions, who have the right to collaborate in the establishment
of a Bavarian Nation.” (<span class='it'>3125-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Frick’s activities as member of Reichstag.</span> Having been
elected to the Reichstag on 4 May 1924, Frick stated that it was
his task not to “support, but to undermine the parliamentary
system” (<span class='it'>2742-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Reichstag Frick immediately proposed those discriminatory
measures against the Jews which were enacted after he and
the other Nazi conspirators had come into power in 1933. On
25 August 1924 Frick demanded in the Reichstag that all Jews
be removed from public office (<span class='it'>3128-PS</span>). Two days later he
returned with a motion calling for “special legislation for all
members of the Jewish race” (<span class='it'>3119-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1930, a significant investigative report was prepared by the
Prussian Ministry of the Interior (<span class='it'>2513-PS</span>). This official report
analyzed the criminal activities of Hitler, Frick, and other Nazis.
It stated that Frick had to be regarded as the most influential
leader of the NSDAP next to Hitler. This document reported
that at the 1927 Party Congress in Nurnberg, Frick said that the
Nazi Party would first infiltrate into parliament and misuse its
privileges, then abolish it and thus open the way for racial dictatorship.
The document also reported that Frick stated in a
speech in 1929 at Pyritz that this fateful struggle would first be
taken up with the ballot, but that this could not continue indefinitely,
for history had taught that in a battle “blood must be
shed and iron broken.” As early as 1929, according to this same
report, Frick announced that a Special Peoples’ Court would be
created, in which the enemies of the Nazi Party would be called
to account for their political acts (<span class='it'>2513-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Frick’s activities as Minister of Interior and Education in
Thuringia.</span> Frick’s prominent role in helping to bring the Nazis
to power was recognized when on 23 January 1930 he was appointed
Minister of the Interior and Education in the German
State of Thuringia, the first ministerial appointment controlled
by the National Socialists (<span class='it'>3119-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in this capacity that Frick began his manipulation to
provide Adolf Hitler with German citizenship, an essential step
<span class='pageno' title='656' id='Page_656'></span>
toward the realization of the Nazi conspiracy. It must be remembered
that Hitler at that time was not a German citizen
and was regarded by the Prussian police administration as an
undesirable alien. This lack of German citizenship was most
damaging to the cause of the Nazi Party because, as an alien,
Hitler could not become a candidate for the Reich Presidency in
Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the beginning, Frick was unsuccessful when he tried to
grant Hitler German citizenship by appointing Hitler as police
officer in Thuringia, thus conferring German citizenship automatically.
Later he succeeded with a similar maneuver. This
was expressly confirmed by Otto Meissner, former State Secretary
and Chief of Hitler’s Presidential Chancellery, in an affidavit
which reads in part as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Frick also, in collaboration with Klagges, Minister of Brunswick,
succeeded in naturalizing Hitler as a German citizen in
1932 by having him appointed a Brunswick government official
(Counsellor of Government). This was done in order
to make it possible for Hitler to run as a candidate for the
office of President of the Reich.” (<span class='it'>3564-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>During his tenure as State Minister in Thuringia, Frick again
misused his official authority in order to advance the Nazi conspiracy
through measures designed to establish Nazi control over
the police, and over the administration and curriculum of universities
and schools. Three of his measures are specially noteworthy:</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) Appointment of the Nazi race theoretician, Dr. Guenther,
as Professor at the University of Jena, against the wishes of the
faculty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) Compulsory introduction in the schools of Nazi prayers
whose nationalistic, militaristic, and blasphemous character was
such that three out of five were declared unconstitutional by the
German Constitutional Court on 11 July 1930.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) Infiltration of Nazis in the Police, which twice provoked
a rupture in the administrative relations between the State of
Thuringia and the Reich Ministry of the Interior, and resulted in
the withdrawal of the important police subsidy payment of the
Reich to the State. (<span class='it'>3132-PS; 3128-PS</span>)</p>

<h3>C. <span class='it'>FRICK’S PARTICIPATION IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF TOTALITARIAN CONTROL OVER GERMANY.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Frick’s appointment as Reichsministerof the Interior in the
first Hitler Cabinet of 30 January 1933 gave him the task of
<span class='pageno' title='657' id='Page_657'></span>
“strengthening the power of the government and to secure the
New Regime” (<span class='it'>3128-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Powers of Frick as Minister of Interior.</span> To this task his
Ministry was perfectly suited. As Minister of the Interior Frick
became responsible for the realization of a large part of the conspirators’
program, through both legislation and administration.
His Ministry was charged especially with the following tasks:</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) Internal Administration (State and local governments;
State and Local Civil Service).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) Relations between Nazi Party and State.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) Elections.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>d</span>) Citizenship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>e</span>) Racial Law and Policy (Jewish Question, Eugenics), National
Health.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>f</span>) Armed Forces and Reich Defense (Conscription).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>g</span>) Establishment of the New Order in occupied and annexed
territories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>h</span>) Legislation, Constitutional Law (civil liberties).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>i</span>) Police Forces (including Gestapo, protective custody, concentration
camps). (<span class='it'>3303-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3475-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The names of the men who, according to (<span class='it'>3475-PS</span>), worked
under Frick’s supervision are significant. Among the subordinates
of Frick were “Reich Health Leader, Dr. Conti,” “Reich
Fuehrer SS and Chief of the German Police, Heinrich Himmler,”
and “Reich Labor Service Leader, Konstantin Hierl.” Frick was,
therefore, supreme commander of three important pillars of the
Nazi state: The Nazi Public Health Service, the Police System,
and the Labor Service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wide variety of the activities of Frick as Reich Minister
of the Interior can be judged from the following catalogue of his
functions: He had final authority on constitutional questions,
drafted legislation, had jurisdiction over governmental administration
and civil defense, and was final arbiter of questions concerning
race and citizenship. The Manual for Administrative
Officials also lists sections of his ministry concerned with administrative
problems for the occupied territories, including annexed
territories, the New Order in the South East, the Protectorate of
Bohemia and Moravia, and the New Order in the East (<span class='it'>3475-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Ministry of the Interior also had considerable authority
over the civil service, including such matters as appointment,
tenure, promotion, and discharge. The Manual for Administrative
Officials (<span class='it'>3475-PS</span>) states that Frick’s functions included
supervision of the general law of civil servants, civil servants’
policies, civil service aspirants, education and training of civil
<span class='pageno' title='658' id='Page_658'></span>
servants and political and other officials. Frick’s Ministry also
had extensive jurisdiction over the German civil servants detailed
to the administration of the occupied countries. This fact was
admitted by Wilhelm Stuckart, former Under Secretary of Frick’s
Ministry of the Interior, who stated in an interrogation:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“As far as I know, the officials for the new territories were
selected by the Personnel Office [of the Ministry of the Interior]
according to their qualifications, their physical condition
and maybe also their knowledge of the language.”
(<span class='it'>3570-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the full use of these broad powers, Frick made his essential
contribution to the advancement of the conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Nazi seizure of power of German States.</span> His first act
after the Conspirators’ accession to power was to install Nazi
governments and administrations in all German States where
they were not already in power. The State governments which
refused to hand over their constitutional authority to the Nazi
successors designated by Frick were removed on Frick’s orders.
This was the case in Bavaria, Hamburg, Bremen, Luebeck, Hesse,
Baden, Wuerttemberg, and Saxony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The manner and purpose of this program was clearly stated in
the book, “Dr. Frick and his Ministry,” which was published by
his Under-Secretary Wilhelm Pfundner for Frick’s 60th birthday
in order to establish the full scope of his contribution to the
creation of the Nazis’ “Thousand-Year Reich”:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“While Marxism in Prussia was crushed by the hard fist of
the Prussian Prime Minister, Hermann Goering, and a gigantic
wave of propaganda was initiated for the Reichstag elections
of 5 March 1933, Dr. Frick prepared the complete
seizure of power in all states of the Reich. All at once the
political opposition disappeared. All at once the Main
[River] line was eliminated. From this time on only one will
and one leadership reigned in the German Reich.” (<span class='it'>3119-PS</span>;
<span class='it'>3132-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Abolition of political opposition.</span> Frick then proceeded to
destroy all opposition parties in order to establish the political
monopoly of the Nazi Party over Germany. Here again he acted
by legislative fiat against all parties which did not dissolve voluntarily.
Among the laws which he initiated for this purpose were
the law of 26 May 1933 confiscating Communists’ property
(<span class='it'>1396-PS</span>); the law of 14 July 1933 confiscating property inimical
to nation and state (<span class='it'>1388-PS</span>); the law of 7 July 1933 voiding
<span class='pageno' title='659' id='Page_659'></span>
the mandates of all Social Democrat candidates elected to
Reich state and local diets (<span class='it'>2058-PS</span>); and the law of 14 July
1933 outlawing all political parties other than the Nazi Party
(<span class='it'>1388-A-PS</span>; see <span class='it'>2403-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frick drafted and administered the laws which assured the
control of the Nazi Party over the State and “placed the government
machinery * * * at the disposal of the Party.” Chief
among these enactments were the Law to Secure the Unity of
Party and State, of 1 December 1933, which provided that all
government agencies should “lend legal and administrative aid to
the Party agencies” (<span class='it'>1395-PS</span>), and the law of 1 August 1934
consolidating the positions of Chief of State and Leader of the
Party (<span class='it'>2003-PS</span>; see <span class='it'>3119-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The success of this series of measures was accurately described
by Frick himself in the following terms:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In National Socialist Germany, leadership is in the hands
of an organized community, the National Socialist Party;
and as the latter represents the will of the nation, the policy
adopted by it in harmony with the vital interests of the nation
is, at the same time, the policy adopted by the country
* * *.” (<span class='it'>3258-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>Consolidation of power in Reich Cabinet.</span> Frick’s next
task was to consolidate the executive and legislative control thus
achieved. First he drafted the law of 24 March 1933, which
gave the Reich Cabinet the power to legislate by decree. This
law marked the end of parliamentary government in Germany
(<span class='it'>2001-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a further step in the same direction, Frick prepared a
series of laws which destroyed all autonomous State and local
government. Through these laws, all governmental power in
Germany was consolidated in the Reich Cabinet. Administration
of these laws was placed in the hands of Frick. These enactments
include the Temporary Law for the Coordination of the
States with the Reich, of 31 March 1933 (<span class='it'>2004-PS</span>); the Law
for the Coordination of the States with the Reich, of 7 April 1933
(<span class='it'>2005-PS</span>); the law of 30 January 1934 transferring the sovereignty
of the states to the Reich; the first ordinance under the law
of 30 January 1934 subjecting state legislation to Reich approval,
2 February 1934; the second Reich Governor Law of 30 January
1935; the German Municipality Act of 30 January 1935 (<span class='it'>2008-PS</span>);
and the law of 14 February 1934 abolishing the Reichsrat.
(see <span class='it'>3119-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2380-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frick drafted the laws which abolished the independence of the
<span class='pageno' title='660' id='Page_660'></span>
civil service, including functionaries of the Reich and the States,
judges, and university teachers. As Reichsminister of the Interior,
he was charged with the administration of these laws.
Among these laws was the Civil Service Act of 7 April 1933,
paragraphs 3 and 4 of which provided for the elimination of
civil servants on the basis of religious or political beliefs (<span class='it'>1397-PS</span>;
see <span class='it'>3119-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>This complete subjection of the civil servants to the Nazi-controlled
Ministry of Interior was well illustrated by an order
of Frick demanding a report on civil servants who had failed to
vote in the Reichstag elections of 29 March 1936 (<span class='it'>D-43</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(5) <span class='it'>Establishment of the Police State.</span> Having thus taken possession
of the entire government machinery, Frick organized a
huge Reich police in order to maintain the conspirators’ power
against all opposition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It should be emphasized that before this time there was no
unified Reich police system; each individual German State had
a police force of its own. Even then, Frick had complete control
over the police forces, through the Reich Governor Act which
subjected the State governments to the authority of the Reich
government, in the person of the Reich Minister of the Interior
(<span class='it'>2005-PS</span>; <span class='it'>L-82</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The decisive change-over to centralized totalitarianism was
effected by the Act of 17 June 1936 (RGBl, 1936, Part I, p. 487),
which was signed by Frick and Hitler (<span class='it'>2073-PS</span>). Section 1 of
this decree reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“For the unification of police duties in the Reich, a Chief
of German Police is instituted in the German Ministry of
the Interior, to whom is assigned the direction and conduct
of all police affairs.” (<span class='it'>2073-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Section 2 shows that it was Frick and Hitler, the signers of
the decree, who appointed Himmler as Chief of the German
Police. Paragraph 2, section 2 of the decree states that Himmler
was “subordinated individually and directly to the Reich and
Prussian Minister of the Interior” (<span class='it'>2073-PS</span>). In other words,
Frick not only appointed Himmler but himself became, pursuant
to this decree, the supreme commander of the Reich police
system in his capacity as Reich and Prussian Minister of the
Interior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The official chart of the German police system (<span class='it'>1852-PS</span>; <span class='it'>see
Chart Number 16</span>) clearly shows the position of Reichsministerof
the Interior Frick as the head of the entire German police system.
<span class='pageno' title='661' id='Page_661'></span>
This includes the notorious RSHA, of which Kaltenbrunner became
chief under Frick in January 1943 (<span class='it'>3119-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frick used this newly created authority for the promotion of
the Nazi conspiracy. By his decree of 12 February 1936 he
established in detail the jurisdiction of the Secret State Police
(Gestapo), especially over the concentration camps and in the
field of political police information (<span class='it'>2108-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>By his decree of 20 September 1936, published in the Ministerial
Gazette of the Reich (<span class='it'>Ministerialblatt des Reichs-und
Preussischen Ministerium des Innern</span>), 1936, page 1343, (<span class='it'>2245-PS</span>),
Frick reserved for himself the authority to appoint inspectors
of security police and ordered their close cooperation with
the Party and with the Army. Furthermore, in an ordinance
dated 18 March 1938 (RGBl, 1938, Part I, page 262) (<span class='it'>1437-PS</span>)
concerning the reunion of Austria with the Reich, Frick authorized
Himmler to take security measures in Austria without regard
to previous legal limitations. Similarly, in his Decree of 11
November 1938 Frick ordered that all authorities cooperate
closely with the SD and RSHA under Himmler (<span class='it'>1638-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frick’s direct control over Himmler’s Reich police can also be
shown in numerous other instances. It is necessary only to
mention Himmler’s order of 26 June 1936 by which he authorized
Reinhard Heydrich, Chief of the SD, and Kurt Daluege, Chief
of the regular police, to sign “By order of the Minister of the
Interior” (<span class='it'>1551-PS</span>; <span class='it'>1680-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a result, the Police and part of Himmler’s SS became in
fact merged under Frick’s jurisdiction. An order by Hitler dated
17 August 1938 regulated the functions of the SS, which “have
entered into close connection with the duties of the German
police” in the Ministry of Interior (<span class='it'>647-PS</span>; see <span class='it'>1637-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Similarly, Frick gave direct orders to the State Gestapo offices.
Thus on 6 November 1934 Frick issued an order addressed,
among others, to the Prussian Gestapo, prohibiting the publication
of Protestant church announcements (<span class='it'>1498-PS</span>), and also
issued a secret circular addressed, among others, to the Prussian
Gestapo, subjecting Catholic youth organizations to severe restrictions
(<span class='it'>1482-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not necessary here to repeat the evidence concerning the
criminal activities of the German police, over which Frick had
supreme authority. Reference is made to Chapter XI on Concentration
Camps, Chapter XII on Persecution of the Jews, Section
6, Chapter VII on Persecution of the Church, and Chapter XV on
the criminal organizations, such as the SA, SS, the Gestapo,
and SD. Frick’s personal familiarity with these illegal activities
<span class='pageno' title='662' id='Page_662'></span>
may be illustrated by two striking instances. The first instance
is contained in a synopsis of correspondence between the Reich
Ministry of the Interior and its field offices from November 1942
through August 1943, concerning the legal aspects of the confiscation
of property by the SS for the enlargement of the concentration
camp at Auschwitz (<span class='it'>1643-PS</span>). This document contains
the minutes of a meeting held on 17 and 18 December 1942 concerning
the confiscation of this property. These minutes indicate
that a further discussion was to be held on this subject on
21 December 1942, between the representatives of the Reichsminister
of the Interior and the Reichsfuehrer SS. There is also
a summary of a teletype letter, 22 January 1943, from Dr.
Hoffman, representing the Reichsministerof the Interior, to the
<span class='it'>Regierungspraesident</span> in Kattowitz, a provincial administrator
under the direct jurisdiction of the Reichsministerof the Interior.
The summary begins significantly with the sentence:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The territory of the Auschwitz Concentration Camp will
be changed into an independent estate.” (<span class='it'>1643-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A second illustration of Frick’s personal interest in the activities
of Himmler’s police and SS is the fact that in 1943 Frick
visited the concentration camp at Dachau, where he personally
acquainted himself with the forced malaria inoculation of healthy
camp inmates and with other experiments on human beings carried
out by Dr. Rascher. This is borne out by the affidavit of
Dr. Franz Blaha, a former inmate of the concentration camp at
Dachau, who has stated that Frick made a special tour of inspection
of the malaria and cooling experimental stations at
Dachau (<span class='it'>3249-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(6) <span class='it'>Suppression and terrorization of opponents.</span> Having
established this powerful police organization under his command,
Frick used it especially in order to suppress all internal opposition.
That this would be his aim he had repeatedly announced
even in the years before 1933, when he declared that he was
ready to establish the power of the conspirators with terror and
violence (<span class='it'>2513-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>As early as 1932, Frick threatened his opponents in the Reichstag
with these words:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Don’t worry, when we are in power we shall put all of you
guys in concentration camps.” (<span class='it'>L-83</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In pursuance of this long-planned campaign of political terrorism,
Frick drafted and signed a series of decrees legalizing
all those uses of the political police which he considered necessary
<span class='pageno' title='663' id='Page_663'></span>
in order to establish the dictatorial power of the conspirators
within Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Five days after the accession of the conspirators to power
Frick signed the first law limiting the freedom of assembly and
of the press in Germany. Then, on 28 February 1933, the day
after the Reichstag fire, civil rights in Germany were abolished
altogether by decree signed by Frick (<span class='it'>1390-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The preamble of this decree, which was published on the
morning after the Reichstag fire, stated that the suspension of
civil rights was decreed as a defense measure against Communist
acts of violence endangering the State. At the time of
publication of this decree, the Nazi government announced that
a thorough investigation had proven that the Communists had
set fire to the Reichstag building. It is not necessary here to go
into the controversial question of who set fire to the Reichstag,
but it should be stressed that the official Nazi statement that
the Communists had set fire to the building, on which Frick’s
law was predicated, was issued without any investigation. Proof
of this fact is contained in an interrogation of Goering on 13
October 1945, which contains the following passage:</p>

<table id='tab52' summary='' class='center'>
<colgroup>
<col span='1' style='width: 5em;'/>
<col span='1' style='width: 30em;'/>
</colgroup>
<tr><td class='tab52c1 tdStyle0'>“Q.</td><td class='tab52c2 tdStyle3'>How could you tell your press agent, one hour after the Reichstag caught fire, that the Communists did it, without investigation?</td></tr>

<tr><td class='tab52c1 tdStyle0'>A.</td><td class='tab52c2 tdStyle3'>That is right, but you must take into account that at that time the Communist activity was extremely strong, that our new government as such was not very secure.” (<span class='it'>3593-PS</span>)</td></tr>
</table>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='664' id='Page_664'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>This Act of 28 February 1933 also constituted the basis for the
establishment of the concentration camps. Frick himself established
in detail the handling of so-called “protective custody”
under which inmates were held in concentration camps (<span class='it'>779-PS</span>;
<span class='it'>1723-PS</span>; <span class='it'>L-302</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frick also signed two laws designed specifically to suppress all
criticism and opposition to the Government and the Nazi Party
(<span class='it'>1652-PS</span>; <span class='it'>1393-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frick also signed the laws which brought about the suppression
of independent labor unions as a potential source of opposition
inside Germany to the progress of the Nazi conspiracy
(<span class='it'>405-PS</span>; <span class='it'>1861-PS</span>; <span class='it'>1770-PS</span>). Among these decrees was the
law providing for the confiscation of all labor union property in
favor of the German Labor Front (<span class='it'>1403-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Furthermore, Frick and his subordinates took an active part
in the persecution of the independent churches. An order of the
Reichsminister of the Interior dated 6 November 1934 prohibited
the publication of Protestant church announcements (<span class='it'>1498-PS</span>);
likewise Frick issued a circular letter to Reich officials imposing
severe restrictions on Catholic youth organizations (<span class='it'>1482-PS</span>).
Frick further on 5 May 1938 wrote to the heads of government
agencies proposing methods for invalidating the concordat between
Austria and the Holy See (<span class='it'>680-PS</span>). His Ministry was
also in correspondence with the SD from 1940-1942 concerning
the confiscation of church property (<span class='it'>R-101-A, through R-101-D</span>).</p>

<h3>D. <span class='it'>FRICK’S PROMOTION OF RACIAL PERSECUTION AND RACISM.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Frick promoted the program of racial persecution and racism,
involving the wiping out of the Jews, and the killing of the
allegedly insane and others for whom the German war machine
had no further use.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to its many other responsibilities, the vast administrative
empire of Frick controlled the enactment and administration
of racial and eugenic legislation. The “Manual
for German Administrative Officials” (<span class='it'>3475-PS</span>) shows the following
additional functions of Frick’s Ministry: Health Administration,
Social Hygiene; Heredity and Racial Welfare; Reich
Plenipotentiary for Sanitaria and Nursing Homes; Board for
the Examination of Physicians, Dentists and Pharmacists; and
Reich Committee for Public Hygiene. Accordingly, Frick was
the administrative guardian and protector of the German race.
<span class='pageno' title='665' id='Page_665'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Persecution of Jews.</span> Frick took charge of the legislative
and administrative program through which the Nazi conspirators
sought to wipe out the “non-Aryan” part of the German
population. Here again he drafted, signed, and administered the
basic legislation. Among these discriminatory enactments were
the following: the Reich Citizens Law of 15 September 1935 depriving
Jews of their citizenship rights (<span class='it'>1416-PS</span>); the law for
the protection of German blood and honor, 15 September 1935,
prohibiting mixed marriages (<span class='it'>2000-PS</span>); the first ordinance
under the Reich Citizens Law, 14 November 1935, depriving
Jews of the right to vote (<span class='it'>1417-PS</span>); the Civil Service Act of 7
April 1933 providing for the elimination of non-Aryan government
workers (<span class='it'>1397-PS</span>); the decree of 20 May 1938 introducing
the Nurnberg laws in Austria; the decree of 31 May 1941 introducing
the Nurnberg laws in the annexed eastern territories (<span class='it'>see
3119-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Extending his program of persecution even to the religious
practices of the Jews, Frick signed the decree which outlawed
ritual slaughtering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the activities of Frick’s Ministry were not restricted to
the commission of such crimes, camouflaged in the form of legislation.
The police field offices, subordinates to Frick, participated
in the organization of such terroristic activities as the pogrom
of 9 November 1938. The pogrom was organized through a series
of secret teletype orders issued by Heydrich (<span class='it'>374-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3051-PS</span>).
Afterward Heydrich reported on the loss of Jewish life and property
resulting from the pogrom (<span class='it'>3058-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pogroms gave the Nazi conspirators occasion to proceed to
the complete elimination of the Jews from economic life and the
confiscation of most of their property (<span class='it'>1662-PS</span>; <span class='it'>1409-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three days after this pogrom of 9 November 1938 Frick, his
undersecretary Stuckart, and his subordinates Heydrich and
Daluege, participated in a conference on the Jewish question
under the chairmanship of Goering. At this meeting various
measures were discussed which the individual governmental departments
should initiate against the Jews. Goering’s concluding
remark in that conference was:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Also the Minister of the Interior and the Police will have
to think over what measures will have to be taken.” (<span class='it'>1816-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>It was, accordingly, Frick’s duty to follow up by administrative
action the pogrom organized by Frick’s own subordinates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thereafter, Frick signed the Law of 23 July 1938 ordering a
<span class='pageno' title='666' id='Page_666'></span>
special registration for all Jews, in order to establish the strictest
possible control over the Jewish population.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the outbreak of the war Heydrich issued an order in
Frick’s name, compelling all Jews to wear a yellow star in public
(<span class='it'>2118-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the Ordinances which Frick issued under the Reich
Citizen Law of 15 September 1935, special mention should be
made of the 11th Ordinance of 25 November 1941, which ordered
the confiscation of the property of all deported or emigrated
Jews; and the 13th Ordinance, under which the Jews
were deprived of all legal protection and completely handed over
to the jurisdiction of the police (<span class='it'>1422-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3085-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stuckart, Under-Secretary in the Ministry of Interior, characterized
this legislation as the essential preparation for the
“final solution of the Jewish question” (<span class='it'>3131-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Measures against “Inferior Racial Stock.”</span> The Public
Health Service was administered as a division of Frick’s Ministry.
One of its subdivisions was devoted to race and heredity
problems (<span class='it'>3123-PS</span>). In his capacity as chief of this service
Frick drafted the basic law controlling sterilization of persons
afflicted with “hereditary diseases” (<span class='it'>3067-PS</span>). Its administration
was in the hands of his Ministry (<span class='it'>D-181</span>; <span class='it'>L-305</span>).</p>

<h3>E. <span class='it'>FRICK’S PARTICIPATION IN THE PREPARATIONS FOR AGGRESSIVE WAR.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Frick wholeheartedly supported the conspirators’ preparations
for war. It was his position that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Germany would observe her international undertakings
only so long as it suited Germany’s interests to do so.”
(<span class='it'>2385-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Frick, as Reich Minister of the Interior, was</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The ‘civilian’ defense minister and as such cooperated
prominently * * * in the important field of ‘defense
legislation’ and thereby in the development of * * * Germany’s
armed forces.” (<span class='it'>3119-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Frick’s Ministry had a division entitled “Armed Forces and
Reich Defense” (<span class='it'>3303-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Rearmament and reinstitution of military service.</span> Frick
took a leading part in Germany’s rearmament in violation of the
Versailles Treaty. He drafted the basic laws on military sevice.
These include the law of 16 March 1935 reintroducing universal
military conscription (<span class='it'>1654-PS</span>); the decree of 6 March 1936
<span class='pageno' title='667' id='Page_667'></span>
extending military and labor service to German citizens abroad;
the decree of 16 June 1938 extending the military service law to
Austria (<span class='it'>1660-PS</span>); and the decree of 30 April 1940 extending
the Military Service Law to the incorporated eastern territories
(<span class='it'>see 3043-PS</span>; <span class='it'>1389-PS</span>; <span class='it'>388-PS, item 20</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frick also supported the military training program of the SA,
for the financing of which his Ministry of Interior was called
upon to supply funds (<span class='it'>1850-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Additional evidence that Frick contributed to Germany’s rearmament
for aggressive war is contained in a secret order, 25
July 1933, from the Supreme Command of the SA on the subject,
“Publications of the SA.” This order states that several days
before 25 July 1933 the Reich Ministry of the Interior at the request
of the Foreign Office gave strict instructions to all Reich
authorities that the most severe control was to be exercised over
all publications which might give other countries an opportunity
to construe German activities as infringements of the Versailles
Treaty (<span class='it'>D-44</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Fifth column activities abroad.</span> In further preparation
for the aggressive wars planned by the conspirators, Frick used
his power, prestige, and funds as Minister of the Interior in order
to command support for the organization of a Fifth Column
abroad among foreign nationals of German ancestry. In a circular
of 24 February 1933 issued less than a month after the conspirators
had taken over the government of Germany, Frick
ordered all State governments to support, especially financially,
the organization work of the League for Germandom Abroad
among the</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“30 million Germans in foreign countries [<span class='it'>Auslandsdeutschen.</span>]
outside of the present contracted borders of the
Reich [who] are an integral part of the entire German
people.” (<span class='it'>3258-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Frick at a later date stated even more clearly the true purpose
of this German Fifth Column he was helping to organize abroad.
In his speech at the twentieth annual meeting of the official German
Foreign Institute held in Stuttgart, on 11-15 August 1937,
Frick stated that—</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“the new Germany has recognized that its attention and devotion
to the welfare of the millions of Germans who have
not the fortune to owe political allegiance to Germany, but
who are condemned to live abroad, are not merely a matter
of natural sympathy and solidarity, but are in a higher
<span class='pageno' title='668' id='Page_668'></span>
degree dictated by the strong political and economic interests
of the Reich.” (<span class='it'>3258-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Organization of civilian agencies for war.</span> Frick’s principal
contribution to the war preparations of the Nazi conspirators
lay in his role as General Plenipotentiary for the Administration
of the Reich. He occupied this position as a member
of the Reich Defense Council, beginning on 21 May 1935
(<span class='it'>2978-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this capacity, Frick had complete authority over</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“the uniform direction of the nonmilitary administration
with the exception of the economic administrations.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>He was given control over the Ministries of Interior, Justice,
Education, Churches, and the Office for Spatial Planning, in
order to direct their entire planning activities in preparation of
war (<span class='it'>2986-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2194-PS</span>). This was Frick’s responsibility during
the more than 4 years that elapsed before the actual launching
of the conspirators’ first aggressive war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As General Plenipotentiary for the Administration, Frick was
a member of the so-called Three-Man Committee, with Schacht,
later Funk (Economy), and Keitel (OKW). This small group,
which was empowered to legislate by decree on all matters relating
to war preparedness, represented during these decisive
years, from 1935 to 1939, a compact, powerful body in which
could be concentrated the conspirators’ preparations for war
(<span class='it'>2986-PS</span>; see also Section 3, chapter XV on the Reich Cabinet).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a speech made on 7 March 1940 at the University of Freiburg,
Frick admitted the significant part he played in the preparations
for war and as a member of the triumvirate created by
the secret Reich Defense Law.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * The organization of the nonmilitary national
defense fits organically into the entire structure of the
National Socialist government and administration. This
state of affairs is not exceptional, but a necessary and
planned part of the National Socialist order. Thus, the
conversion of our administration and economy to wartime
conditions has been accomplished very quickly and without
any friction—avoiding the otherwise very dangerous changes
of the entire structure of the State.</p>

<p>“The planned preparation of the administration for the possibility
of a war has already been carried out during the
peace. For this purpose, the Fuehrer appointed a Plenipotentiary
General for the Reich Administration and a Plenipotentiary
General for the Economy. The Plenipotentiary
<span class='pageno' title='669' id='Page_669'></span>
General for the Administration was placed in charge of the
coordination of the nonmilitary administrations, with the
exception of the Administration of Economics.” (<span class='it'>2608-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<h3>F. <span class='it'>FRICK’S PARTICIPATION IN THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT WAR CRIMES.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Frick, as Minister of the Interior, was charged with the administrative
policy for all occupied and annexed territories. For this
purpose, the Ministry contained a Division for Incorporated
Territories, with Subdivisions entitled Reorganization in the
South-East, the Protectorate, the East, and the West (<span class='it'>3475-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the Nazi conspirators embarked on their program of
“bloodless” territorial aggrandizement, Frick was in control of
the incorporation and administration of these territories. Thus,
it was Frick’s Ministry which introduced the German New Order
and German law throughout the territories of Europe occupied
by the German Armed Forces. Frick exercised these powers in
the Saar; in Austria (<span class='it'>2307-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3075-PS</span>); in the Sudetenland
(<span class='it'>3076-PS</span>); in Bohemia and Moravia (<span class='it'>2119-PS</span>); in Memel; and
in Danzig (<span class='it'>3077-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the conspirators started their aggressive Wars, Frick
was specifically charged with the organization and integration
of the territories illegally annexed by Germany. Among the
territories over which Frick was given control were the Incorporated
Eastern Territories, the Gouvernment-General of Poland,
Eupen, Malmedy, and Moresnot, and Norway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the exercise of this over-all administrative control:</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) Frick provided in detail for the administration of occupied
Polish Territory. It was Frick who was responsible for
the installation of an SS Chief in the Territory in charge of the
Police and the forced resettlement program (<span class='it'>3304-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) Frick provided the administrative personnel for the government
of these occupied territories. Thus, he arranged for the
selection and assignment of hundreds of occupation officials for
Russia before the invasion had even begun (<span class='it'>1039-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Similarly, Wilhelm Stuckart, former Under-Secretary of the
Interior under Frick, has stated in an interrogation:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“As far as I knew, the officials for the new territories were
selected by the Personnel Office [of the Ministry of the Interior]
according to their qualifications, their physical condition,
and maybe also their knowledge of the language.”
(<span class='it'>3570-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(3) Frick had complete charge of the program of denationalization,
<span class='pageno' title='670' id='Page_670'></span>
under which certain groups of citizens in annexed territories
were forced during the progress of the war to abandon their
original national allegiance and to accept German nationality. The
decree of 4 March 1941 established a German Racial Registry
under which allied nationals of German stock were required to
accept German nationality and to remove to German territory
(<span class='it'>2917-PS</span>). Among the conquered territories in which these activities
of Frick were felt were Bohemia and Moravia, Upper
Corinthia and Lower Styria, Eupen, Malmedy, and Moresnot, and
the Incorporated Eastern Territories (see <span class='it'>3225-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>These measures place upon Frick a full share of responsibility
for the war crimes committed by the conspiracy in the occupied
and annexed territories.</p>

<h3>G. <span class='it'>FRICK’S PARTICIPATION IN THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Frick actively participated in the execution of the conspirators’
program of atrocities and Crimes against Humanity. Even without
such personal participation, however, Frick has admitted that
he could properly be charged with having for 12 years continued
in the Reich Cabinet, after he had realized the direction the
conspiracy was taking (<span class='it'>3043-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scope of Frick’s personal and direct responsibility for Nazi
Crimes against Humanity is so broad that reference need be
made only to a few of the most significant instances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Gestapo atrocities and concentration camps.</span> Frick, as
jurisdictional head of the German Police Administration, is responsible
for the crimes and atrocities perpetrated by the German
police, especially the Gestapo and SD, inside and outside of Germany.
(See <span class='it'>1643-PS</span>; also Chapter XI on Concentration Camps.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>As already stated, Frick demonstrated particular interest in
the “medical” experiments carried on in the concentration camps
under the personal direction of Himmler. Frick paid a personal
visit to Germany’s oldest concentration camp, Dachau, in 1943,
for the purpose of inspecting the malaria station and Dr.
Rascher’s Experimental Station (<span class='it'>3249-PS</span>). There he could personally
acquaint himself with the forced subjection of healthy
camp inmates to malarial mosquitos and the air-pressure and
freezing experiments on human beings carried on by Dr. Rascher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Oppression of inhabitants of occupied territories.</span> As administrative
head of the occupied territories, Frick issued decrees
depriving the inhabitants of their rights and subjecting them to a
<span class='pageno' title='671' id='Page_671'></span>
cruel and discriminatory regime. Among these enactments were
the decree of 4 December 1941 establishing a special penal law
for the Polish and Jewish inhabitants of the Gouvernment General
(<span class='it'>R-96</span>), (<span class='it'>1249-PS</span>); the decree of 1 July 1943 depriving
Jews of rights remaining to them under the decree of 4 December
1941 (<span class='it'>1422-PS</span>); and the Himmler ordinance of 3 July 1943
charging the Gestapo with the execution of the decree of 1 July
1943 (published in Frick’s Ministry of Interior Gazette 1943, p.
1085) (<span class='it'>3085-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Similarly, the Decree on the Utilization of Eastern Workers,
which required that they be paid salaries substantially below
those fixed for German workers holding similar jobs, was signed
in Frick’s name by his Secretary of State.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Systematic killing of insane, ill, aged, and incapacitated
foreign slave laborers.</span> Frick’s greatest guilt perhaps rests on
his responsibility, as Reich Minister of the Interior, for the systematic
killing of the insane, the sick, and the aged, including
those foreign forced laborers who were no longer able to work.
These killings were carried out in nursing homes, hospitals, and
asylums. Frick, in his capacity of Reichsminister of the Interior,
had full jurisdiction over all these institutions (<span class='it'>3475-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Proof that the Reichministry of the Interior under Frick actually
exercised this jurisdiction is to be found in a letter of 2
October 1940 (<span class='it'>621-PS</span>) from the Chief of the Reich Chancellery,
Dr. Lammers, to the Reichsminister of Justice. The letter informed
the Minister of Justice that the Chief Prosecutors’ reports
concerning the death of inmates of nursing homes had been
transmitted to the Reichsminister of the Interior for further
action (<span class='it'>621-PS</span>). Through other correspondence Frick’s Ministry
of the Interior was informed of the unexplained deaths of
insane persons (<span class='it'>1696-PS</span>; <span class='it'>1969-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The most striking example of the continued killings in these
institutions, which were under Frick’s jurisdiction, is the famous
Hadamar case. Systematic killing started at the Hadamar nursing
home as early as 1939. At least as early as 1941 Frick was
officially acquainted with the fact that these killings had become
public knowledge. Proof is found in a letter from the Bishop
of Limburg of 13 August 1941 to the Reichsminister of Justice,
copies of which were sent to the Reichsminister of the Interior
and the Reichsministerfor Church Affairs. The letter reads in
part as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * About 8 kilometers from Limburg, in the little
town of Hadamar, on a hill overlooking the town, there is an
<span class='pageno' title='672' id='Page_672'></span>
institution which had formerly served various purposes and
of late had been used as a nursing home; this institution
was renovated and furnished as a place in which, by consensus
of opinion, the above-mentioned Euthenasia has been
systematically practiced for months—approximately since
February 1941. The fact has become known beyond the administrative
district of Wiesbaden, because death certificates
from a Registry Hadamar-Moenchberg are sent to the home
communities. * * *</p>

<p>“Several times a week buses arrive in Hadamar with a
considerable number of such victims. School children of the
vicinity know this vehicle and say: ‘There comes the murder-box
again.’ After the arrival of the vehicle, the citizens
of Hadamar watch the smoke rise out of the chimney and
are tortured with the ever-present thought of the miserable
victims, especially when repulsive odors annoy them, depending
on the direction of the wind.</p>

<p>“The effect of the principles at work here are: Children call
each other names and say, ‘You’re crazy; you’ll be sent to
the baking oven in Hadamar.’ Those who do not want
to marry, or find no opportunity, say ‘Marry, never! Bring
children into the world so they can be put into the bottling
machine!’ You hear old folks say, ‘Don’t send me to a state
hospital! After the feeble-minded have been finished off,
the next useless eaters whose turn will come are the old
people.’</p>

<p>“* * * The population cannot grasp that systematic actions
are carried out which in accordance with Par. 211 of
the German criminal code are punishable with death!
* * *</p>

<p>“Officials of the Secret State Police, it is said, are trying
to suppress discussion of the Hadamar occurrences by means
of severe threats. In the interest of public peace, this may
be well intended. But the knowledge and the conviction and
the indignation of the population cannot be changed by it;
the conviction will be increased with the bitter realization
that discussion is prohibited with threats but that the actions
themselves are not prosecuted under penal law.</p>

<p>“<span class='it'>Facta loquuntur.</span></p>

<p>“I beg you most humbly, Herr Reich Minister, in the sense
of the report of the Episcopate of July 16 of this year, to
prevent further transgressions of the Fifth Commandment
of God.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“(Signed)&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Hilfrich” (<span class='it'>615-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='673' id='Page_673'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, the killings in these institutions continued year
after year. This is shown by a certified copy of the charge,
specifications, and findings of the U. S. Military Commission at
Wiesbaden, against the individuals who operated the Hadamar
Sanitarium, where many Russians and Poles were done away
with. In this particular proceeding, seven defendants were
charged with the murder in 1944 and 1945 of 400 persons of
Polish and Russian nationality. Three of the defendants were
sentenced to be hanged; the other four were sentenced to confinement
at hard labor (<span class='it'>3592-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the murdering in Hadamar was only part of a systematic
program. The official report of the Czechoslovak War Crimes
Commission, entitled “Detailed Statement on the Murdering of Ill
and Aged People in Germany,” shows that Frick was one of the
originators of the secret law of 1940, which authorized the
killing of sick and aged persons and under which the Hadamar
“murder mill” was operated until 1945. The first 3 paragraphs
of that report read as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“1. The murdering can be traced back to a secret law which
was released some time in the summer of 1940.</p>

<p>“2. Besides the Chief Physician of the Reich, Dr. L. Conti,
the Reichsfuehrer SS Himmler, the Reichsminister of the
Interior Dr. Frick, as well as other men, the following participated
in the introduction of this secret law * * *.</p>

<p>“3. As I have already stated, there were—after careful calculation—at
least 200,000 mainly mentally deficient, imbeciles,
besides neurological cases and medically unfit people—these
were not only incurable cases—and at least 75,000 aged
people.” (<span class='it'>1556-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, Frick bears full responsibility for the systematic killing
of the “unproductive eaters,” for whom the Nazi war machine
had no use.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>Oppression in Bohemia and Moravia.</span> The final phase of
Frick’s criminal activities began with his appointment as Protector
in Bohemia and Moravia, on 20 August 1943 (<span class='it'>3086-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>His authority was clearly defined in a Secret Decree issued on
29 August 1943. That Decree provided that the Reich Protector
was “the representative of the Fuehrer in his capacity as Chief
of State.” In addition to this over-all authority, Frick was given
jurisdiction “to confirm the members of the government of the
Protectorate, to appoint, dismiss and retire the German civil
servants in the Protectorate.” He was given full power “to grant
<span class='pageno' title='674' id='Page_674'></span>
pardons and to quash proceedings in all cases except in cases
before the Military and SS Police Courts” (<span class='it'>1366-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>These broad powers establish the clear responsibility of Frick
for the crimes committed in the Protectorate under his administration
during the last 20 months of the War. As representative
of the Fuehrer in the Protectorate, he covered these criminal acts
with Hitler’s name and absolute power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a single example of these crimes, reference may be made to
Supplement 6 to the official Czechoslovak Report on German
Crimes Against Czechoslovakia:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“During the tenure of office of defendant Wilhelm Frick as
Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia from August 1943
until the liberation of Czechoslovakia in 1945, many thousands
of Czechoslovak Jews were transported from the
Terezin ghetto in Czechoslovakia to the concentration camp
at Oswiecziem (Auschwitz) in Poland and were there killed
in the gas chambers.” (<span class='it'>3589-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Frick was also fully responsible for the multiple and notorious
miscarriages of justice by which the population of the Protectorate
was systematically persecuted and oppressed. His failure
to correct these miscarriages of justice through the exercise of
his right to grant pardons and to quash legal proceedings is
tantamount to a confirmation of the cruel and illegal sentences
imposed upon the inhabitants of the Protectorate (<span class='it'>1556-PS</span>;
<span class='it'>3589-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frick’s specific responsibility on these counts must be added
to the over-all responsibility which he bears because of the fact
that he was in power as Reich Protector while such Crimes
against Humanity were committed against the population of
Bohemia and Moravia (<span class='it'>3443-PS</span>).</p>

<h3>H. <span class='it'>CONCLUSION.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Frick, who joined the Nazi conspiracy at its early beginning,
played within the conspiracy the role of expert administrator and
coordinator of State and Party affairs. Misusing his governmental
positions in the pre-Hitler era, he gave aid and protection
to the conspirators when they were still weak. He supported
them in their first attempt to come into power by force,
expecting to gain high office from their success. He was the first
to carry their revolutionary program from the Beer Hall to the
Reichstag Rostrum. As their earliest important office-holder
(in Thuringia), he developed for the first time their totalitarian
and terroristic methods of political and intellectual control.
<span class='pageno' title='675' id='Page_675'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon the accession to power of the Nazi conspirators on 30
January 1933, Frick took over the vital Ministry of Interior.
From this position he directed the realization of the entire domestic
program of the conspiracy. He took complete charge of the
successive destruction of the parliamentary system, of autonomous
State and local government, and of the career civil service.
He planned and executed the measures which subjected the
government itself to the domination of the Nazi Party. He then
proceeded to establish a huge Reich Police Force under Himmler,
which became the instrument with which the Nazi conspirators
terrorized and ultimately “liquidated” all opposition inside and
outside Germany in concentration and extermination camps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In order to give the semblance of law to the criminal acts of the
conspirators, Frick drafted legislation to withdraw constitutional
protection from the rights and liberties which they had determined
to wipe out. He participated in the relentless and violent
persecution of all persons and groups who were considered as
actual or potential opponents of the conspirators’ plans. Among
these were the churches, the free trade unions, and especially the
Jews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having secured absolute control over Germany for the conspirators,
Frick proceeded to bring the German people and State
into readiness for the wars of aggression planned by the conspirators.
He established the system of military and labor service
on which the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> was to rest. He took over the planning
of Germany’s civilian wartime administration, which was
to back it up. In this capacity he organized and supervised the
killing of the useless eaters, the insane, crippled, aged, and such
foreign forced laborers who were no longer able to work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the Nazi conspirators began to achieve their predatory
aims, Frick was active in the coordination of the administration
of the territories and peoples which fell into Nazi hands. He
presided over the annexation of territories and the denationalization
of their inhabitants in violation of the Hague Conventions.
When the conspirators were ready to proceed to the realization of
their ultimate goals, especially the complete enslavement and annihilation
of conquered populations, Frick devised the basic legislation
for their disfranchisement and finally took personal charge
of one of the oppressed nations, Czechoslovakia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, Frick was one of the principal artisans of the conspiracy
throughout its course. His contribution to its progress
was essential in all its phases, and decisive in many. He nurtured
the conspiracy, directed its followers, terrorized its opponents,
and destroyed its victims.
<span class='pageno' title='676' id='Page_676'></span></p>

<h3>I. <span class='it'>POSITIONS HELD BY FRICK.</span></h3>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg689a'>10. JULIUS STREICHER</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Through his words and his deeds Julius Streicher assumed
for himself the unofficial title of “Jew-baiter Number One” of
Nazi Germany. For the course of some twenty-five years,
Streicher educated the German people in hatred and incited them
to the persecution and to the extermination of the Jewish race.
He was an accessory to murder, on a scale perhaps never
attained before.</p>

<h3>A. <span class='it'>STREICHER’S CAREER AND POSITIONS.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Streicher was born in 1885. He became a school teacher in
Nurnberg and formed a party of his own, which he called the
German Socialist Party. The chief policy of that party was
anti-semitism. In 1922 he handed over his party to Hitler, who
wrote a glowing account of Streicher’s generosity in <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>
(<span class='it'>M-3</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The appointments which Streicher held in the Party and state
were few. From 1921 until 1945, he was a member of the Nazi
Party. In 1925 he was appointed Gauleiter of Franconia, and
he remained as such until about February 1940. From the time
<span class='pageno' title='690' id='Page_690'></span>
that the Nazi government came into power in 1933 until 1945 he
was a member of the Reichstag. In addition to that, he held
the title of Obergruppenfuehrer in the SA (<span class='it'>2975-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The propaganda which Streicher carried out throughout those
years was chiefly done through the medium of his newspapers.
He was the editor and publisher of “<span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span>” from 1922
until 1933, and thereafter the publisher and owner of the paper.
In 1933 he also founded and thereafter published a daily newspaper
called the “<span class='it'>Fraenkische Tageszeitung</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition, in later years he published several other papers,
mostly local journals, from Nurnberg.</p>

<h3>B. <span class='it'>STREICHER’S PART IN THE REMOVAL OF OPPOSITION THROUGH ANTI-JEWISH PROPAGANDA AND INCITEMENT.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>The course of Streicher’s incitement and propaganda may be
traced more or less in chronological order by referring to short
extracts from “<span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span>.” The extracts which follow were
selected at random. They were selected with a view to showing
the various methods which Streicher employed to incite the German
people against the Jewish race, but his newspapers are
crowded with them, week after week, day after day. It is impossible
to pick up any copy without finding the same kind of invective
and incitement in the headlines and in the articles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a speech which Streicher made in 1922 in Nurnberg, after
abusing the Jews in the first paragraph, he went on to say:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“We know that Germany will be free when the Jew has been
excluded from the life of the German people.” (<span class='it'>M-11</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In a speech in 1924 he stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I beg you and particularly those of you who carry the
cross throughout the land to become somewhat more serious
when I speak of the enemy of the German people, namely,
the Jew. Not out of irresponsibility or for fun do I fight
against the Jewish enemy, but because I bear within me
the knowledge that the whole misfortune was brought to
Germany by the Jews alone.</p>

<p>“I ask you once more, what is at stake today? The Jew
seeks domination not only among the German people but
among all peoples. The communists pave the way for him.
Do you not know that the God of the Old Testament orders
the Jews to consume and enslave the peoples of the earth?</p>

<p>“The government allows the Jew to do as he pleases. The
people expect action to be taken. You may think about
<span class='pageno' title='691' id='Page_691'></span>
Adolf Hitler as you please, but one thing you must admit.
He possessed the courage to attempt to free the German
people from the Jew by a national revolution. That was
action indeed.” (<span class='it'>M-12</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In a speech in April 1925 Streicher declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“You must realize that the Jew wants our people to perish.
That is why you must join us and leave those who have
brought you nothing but war, inflation, and discord. For
thousands of years the Jew has been destroying the nations.
Let us make a new beginning today so that we can annihilate
the Jews.” (<span class='it'>M-13</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This appears to be the earliest expression of one of the conspirators’
primary objectives—the annihilation of the Jewish
race. Fourteen years later it became the official policy of the
Nazi Government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In April 1932 Streicher made the following statement:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“For 13 years I have fought against Jewry.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“We know that the Jew whether he is baptized as a Protestant
or as a Catholic, remains a Jew. Why cannot you
realize, you Protestant clergymen, you Catholic priests, you
who have scales before your eyes and serve the god of the
Jews who is not the God of Love but the God of Hate. Why
do you not listen to Christ, who said to the Jews, ‘You are
children of the devil’.” (<span class='it'>M-14</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>The Anti-Jewish Boycott of 1933.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>When the Nazi Party came to power, they officially started
their campaign against the Jews by the boycott of 1 April 1933.
The boycott was agreed on and approved by the whole government,
as appears from Goebbels’ diary (<span class='it'>2409-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Streicher was appointed the chairman of the central committee
for the organization of that boycott. He started his work on
Wednesday, 29 March (<span class='it'>2156-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>On that same day the central committee issued a proclamation
announcing that the boycott would start on Saturday at 10:00
AM sharp:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Jewry will realize whom it has challenged.” (<span class='it'>M-7</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 30 March, two days before the boycott was due to start,
an article was published under the title, “Defeat the Enemy of
the World!—by Julius Streicher, official leader of the central
committee to combat the Jewish atrocity and boycott campaign”
(<span class='it'>2153-PS</span>). The article stated, in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Jewry wanted this battle. It shall have it until it realizes
<span class='pageno' title='692' id='Page_692'></span>
that the Germany of the brown battalions is not a country of
cowardice and surrender. Jewry will have to fight until we
have won victory.</p>

<p>“National Socialists! Defeat the enemy of the world. Even
if the world is full of devils, we shall succeed in the end.”
(<span class='it'>2153-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As head of the central committee for that boycott, Streicher
outlined in detail the organization of the boycott in orders which
the committee published on 31 March 1933 (<span class='it'>2154-PS</span>). The
committee stressed that no violence should be employed against
the Jews during the boycott, but not for humanitarian reasons.
The order was issued because, if no violence were employed,
Jewish employers would have no grounds for discharging their
employees without notice, and for refusing to pay them any
wages. The Jews were also reported, apparently, to be transferring
businesses to German figureheads in order to alleviate
the results of this persecution; accordingly the committee declared
that any property so transferred was to be considered as
Jewish for the purpose of the boycott (<span class='it'>2154-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is therefore clear that early in 1933 Streicher was taking a
leading part, as appointed by the Government, in the persecution
against the Jews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Further extracts from Streicher’s newspapers illustrate the
form which his propaganda developed as the years went on.
An article in the New Year’s issue of a new paper founded and
edited by Streicher—a semimedical paper called “The People’s
Health Through Blood and Soil”—is an example of the remarkable
lengths to which he went in propagandizing against the
Jews:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is established for all eternity; alien albumen is the
sperm of a man of alien race. The male sperm in cohabitation
is partially or completely absorbed by the female, and
thus enters her bloodstream. One single cohabitation of a
Jew with an Aryan woman is sufficient to poison her blood
forever. Together with the alien albumen she has absorbed
the alien soul. Never again will she be able to bear purely
Aryan children, even when married to an Aryan. They will
all be bastards, with a dual soul and a body of a mixed
breed. Their children will also be crossbreeds; that means,
ugly people of unsteady character and with a tendency to
illnesses. Now we know why the Jew uses every artifice of
seduction in order to ravish German girls at as early an
age as possible; why the Jewish doctor rapes his patients
while they were under anaesthetic. He wants the German
<span class='pageno' title='693' id='Page_693'></span>
girl and the German woman to absorb the alien sperm of
the Jew. She is never again to bear German children.
But the blood products of all animals right down to the
bacteria like the serum, lymph, extracts from internal organs
etc., are all alien albumen. They have a poisonous
effect if directly introduced into the blood stream either by
vaccination or by injection. By these products of sick
animals the blood is ravished, the Aryan is impregnated
with an alien species. The author and abettor of such action
is the Jew. He has been aware of the secrets of the race
question for centuries, and therefore plans systematically
the annihilation of the nations which are superior to him.
Science and authorities are his instruments for the enforcing
of pseudo-science and the concealment of truth.”
(<span class='it'>M-20</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At the beginning of 1935, the following extract, entitled “The
Chosen People of the Criminals,” appeared in “<span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span>”:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * and all the same, or, let us say, just because of
this, the history book of the Jews, which is usually called
the Holy Scriptures, impresses us as a horrible criminal
romance, which makes the 150 penny-dreadfuls of the
British Jew, Edgar Wallace, go green with envy. This ‘holy’
book abounds in murder, incest, fraud, theft, and indecency.”
(<span class='it'>2697-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In a speech on 4 October 1935 (the month following the
proclamation of the Nurnberg Decrees) Streicher made a speech
which is reported in the <span class='it'>Voelkischer Beobachter</span> and is entitled
in that newspaper “Safeguard of German Blood and German
Honor.” The report in that article reads in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Gauleiter Streicher speaks at a German Labor Front mass
demonstration for the Nurnberg laws.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“We have therefore, to unmask the Jew, and that is what I
have been doing for the past fifteen years.” (<span class='it'>M-34</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In a leading article in “<span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span>” Streicher again emphasized
the part which he himself had taken in this campaign:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“<span class='it'>The ‘Stuermer</span>’s’ 15 years of work of enlightenment has
already led an army of those who know—millions strong—to
National Socialism. The continued work of the ‘<span class='it'>Stuermer</span>’
will help to ensure that every German down to the last man
will, with heart and hand, join the ranks of those whose
aim it is to crush the head of the serpent Pan-Juda beneath
their heels. He who helps to bring this about helps to eliminate
the devil, and this devil is the Jew.” (<span class='it'>M-6</span>).</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pageno' title='694' id='Page_694'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The extraordinary length to which Streicher went in his
propaganda is illustrated by the publication in “<span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span>”
of a photograph of the burning hull of the airship “Hindenburg,”
which caught fire in June 1937 in America. The caption beneath
the picture includes the comment:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The first radio picture from the United States of America
shows quite clearly that a Jew stands behind the explosion
of our airship Hindenburg. Nature has depicted clearly and
quite correctly that devil in human guise.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Although it is not clear from that photograph, the meaning of
that comment is apparently that the cloud of smoke in the air
is in the shape of a Jewish face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a speech in September 1937 at the opening of the Wilhelm
Gustloff bridge in Nurnberg, Streicher declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The man who murdered Wilhelm Gustloff had to come from
the Jewish people, because the Jewish text books teach that
every Jew has the right to kill a non-Jew, and, indeed, that
it is pleasing to the Jewish God to kill as many non-Jews as
possible.</p>

<p>“Look at the way the Jewish people have been following for
thousands of years past; everywhere murder, everywhere
mass murder. Neither must we forget that behind present-day
wars there stands the Jewish financier who pursues his
aims and interests. The Jew always lives on the blood of
other nations; he needs such murder and such victims. For
us who know, the murder of Wilhelm Gustloff is the same
as ritual murder.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“It is our duty to tell the children at school and the bigger
ones what this memorial means.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The Jew no longer shows himself among us openly as he
used to. But it would be wrong to say that victory is ours.
Full and final victory will have been achieved only when the
whole world has been rid of Jews.” (<span class='it'>M-4</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Extracts from the correspondence columns of “<span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span>,”
show another method which Streicher employed in his propaganda
(<span class='it'>M-26</span>; <span class='it'>M-27</span>; <span class='it'>M-28</span>). The correspondence columns of
every issue are full of purported “letters” from Germans protesting
that some German has been buying shoes from a Jewish
shop, etc., thus by printing these letters assisting in the general
boycott of the Jews.
<span class='pageno' title='695' id='Page_695'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>“Ritual Murder” Propaganda.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Another form of propaganda employed by Streicher concerned
the “Ritual Murder.” Sometime in 1934 “<span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span>” began
publishing accounts of Jewish ritual murder which horrified the
whole world to such an extent that even the Archbishop of Canterbury,
together with people from every country in the world,
protested that any government should allow such matter to be
published in their national newspapers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Streicher based his ritual murder propaganda on a medieval
belief that during their Eastertide celebrations the Jews were in
the habit of murdering Christian children. Streicher misrepresented
this medieval belief to make it appear that not only was
this done in the Middle Ages, but that the Jews are still doing it
and still want to do it. A few passages from “<span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span>”
together with descriptions of photographs published therein will
illustrate the type of propaganda that Streicher was putting out
concerning “ritual murder”:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“This the French front-line soldier should take with him to
France: The German people have taken a new lease of life.
They want peace, but if anyone tries to attack them, if anyone
tries to torture them again, if anyone tries to push them
back into the past, then the world would see another heroic
epic; then heaven will decide where righteousness lies—here,
or where the Jew has the whiphand and where he instigates
massacres, one could almost say the biggest ritual murders
of all times. If the German people are to be slaughtered
according to the Jewish rites, the whole world will be thus
slaughtered at the same time.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“As you have drummed morning and evening prayers into
your children’s heads, so now drum this into their heads, so
that the German people may gain the spiritual power to
convince the rest of the world which the Jews desire to
lead against us.” (<span class='it'>M-2</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A photograph published in “<span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span>” in April 1937 purports
to show three Jews ritually murdering a girl by cutting her
throat, with the blood pouring out into a bucket on the ground.
The caption underneath that photograph is as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Ritual murder at Polna. Ritual murder of Agnes Hruza
by the Jews Hilsner, Erdmann[<a href='#polna'><span class='it'>sic</span></a>], and Wassermann, taken from
a contemporary postcard.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Another article in “<span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span>”, in April 1937, describes
what is alleged to happen when ritual murder takes place, and
the blood is mixed with the bread and drunk by the Jews in their
<span class='pageno' title='696' id='Page_696'></span>
feast. During the feast the head of the family is supposed to
explain:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“May all gentiles perish—as the child whose blood is contained
in the bread and wine.” (<span class='it'>2699-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>An article in “<span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span>” for July 1938 has these further
remarks to make on “ritual murder”:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Whoever had the occasion to be an eye-witness during the
slaughtering of animals or to see at least a truthful film on
the slaughtering will never forget this horrible experience.
It is atrocious. And unwillingly, he is reminded of the
crimes which the Jews have committed for centuries on men.
He will be reminded of the ritual murder. History points
out hundreds of cases in which non-Jewish children were
tortured to death. They also were given the same incision
through the throat as is found on slaughtered animals.
They also were slowly bled to death while fully conscious.”
(<span class='it'>2700-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On special occasions, or when Streicher had some particular
subject matter to put before Germany, he was in the habit of
issuing special editions of “<span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span>.” “Ritual murder” was
such a special subject that he issued one of these special editions
dealing solely with it, in May 1939. One of the photographs
published in this issue shows a child having knives stuck into its
side, from which blood is spurting; and below the pedestal on
which the child stands are five presumably dead children bleeding
on the ground. The caption beneath that picture reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“In the year 1476 the Jews in Regensburg murdered six
boys. They drew their blood and tortured them to death in
an underground vault which belongs to the Jew Josfel. The
judges found the body of the murdered boys; and blood
stains are on an altar.”</p>

</div>

<p>Two other pictures are explained by their captions. One reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“For the Jewish New Year celebrations in 1913, World
Jewry published this picture. On the Jewish New Year and
on the Day of Atonement the Jews slaughtered a so-called
‘kapores’ cock; that is to say, dead cock, whose blood and
death is intended to purify the Jews. In 1913 the ‘kapores’
cock had the head of the Russian Czar Nicholas II. By publishing
this postcard the Jews intended to say that Nicholas
II would be their next purifying sacrifice. On the 6th of
July 1918, the Czar was murdered by the Jews Jurowsky and
Goloschtschekin.”</p>

</div>

<p>The other picture shows the Jews holding a similar bird:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * the ‘kapores’ cock which has the head of the
<span class='pageno' title='697' id='Page_697'></span>
Fuehrer. The Hebrew script says that one day Jews will kill
all Hitlerites. Then the Jews will be delivered from all
misfortunes, but in due course the Jews will realize that
they have reckoned without an Adolf Hitler.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to reproductions of a number of previous articles
on “ritual murder” beneath a picture of Streicher, another picture
bears the caption:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“At the Passover Meal. The wine and Matzoh, unleavened
bread, contains non-Jewish blood. The Jew prays before
the meal. He prays for death to all non-Jews.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The fifth page of this same issue reproduces some of the
European and American newspaper articles and letters protesting
against this propaganda on “ritual murder.” Among these
is the “<span class='it'>Stuermer</span>’s” answer to the letter from the Archbishop of
Canterbury, written to the editor of the London <span class='it'>Times</span> in protest
(<span class='it'>M-10</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Page 6 contains another picture of a man having his throat
cut; again the usual spurt of blood falling into a basin on the
floor, with the following caption:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The ritual murder of the boy Heinrich. In the year 1345
the Jews in Munich slaughtered a non-Jewish boy. The
martyr was declared holy by the church.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>On page 8 appears another picture entitled:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Holy Gabriel. This boy was crucified and tortured to
death by the Jews in the year 1690. The blood was drawn
off him.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Page 11 reproduces a piece of sculpture on the wall of the Wallfahrts
Chapel, representing the ritual murder of a boy named
Werner. The picture shows the boy strung up by his feet and
being murdered by two Jews. Page 12 reproduces another picture
taken from the same place. The caption is:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The embalmed body of Trient who was tortured to death by
the Jews.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Page 13 contains another picture; somebody else having a knife
stuck into him; more blood coming out into a basin. On page 14
are two pictures. One is said to show the ritual murder of the
boy Andreas. The other is the picture of a tombstone, and the
caption reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The tombstone of Hilsner. This is the memorial to a
Jewish ritual murderer, Leopold Hilsner. He was found
guilty of two ritual murders and was condemned to death by
hanging in two trials. The emperor was bribed and pardoned
him. Masaryk, the friend of the Jews, liberated him
<span class='pageno' title='698' id='Page_698'></span>
from penal servitude in 1918. On his tombstone lying
Jewry calls this twofold murderer an innocent victim.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The next page produces yet another picture of a woman being
murdered by having her throat cut in the same way. Page 17
produces a picture of the Archbishop of Canterbury together
with a picture of an old Jewish man, with a caption reading:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Dr. Lang, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the highest dignitary
of the English Church, and his allies, a typical example
of the Jewish Race.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The last page contains a picture of “Holy Simon, who was tortured
to death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This issue of “<span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span>” is nothing but an incitement to
the people of Germany who read it, an incitement to murder. It
is filled with pictures of murder, murder alleged to be against the
German people. It is an encouragement, to all who read it to
avenge themselves in the same way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In January 1938 the persecution of the Jews became more and
more severe—another special issue of “<span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span>” was published.
A passage from the leading article in that issue written
by Streicher, states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * The supreme aim and highest task of the state is
therefore to conserve people, blood, and race. But if this is
the supreme task, any crime against this law must be punished
with the supreme penalty. ‘<span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span>’ takes therefore
the view that there are only two punishments for the
crime of polluting the race:</p>

<p>“1. Penal servitude for life for attempted race pollution.</p>

<p>“2. Death for committing race pollution.” (<span class='it'>M-39</span>).</p>

</div>

<p>The following are some of the headlines on the articles contained
in that edition:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Jewish race polluters at work.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“Fifteen year old non-Jewess ravaged.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“A dangerous race polluter. He regards German women as
fair game for himself.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The Jewish sanatorium. A Jewish institution for the cultivation
of race pollution.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“Rape of a feeble-minded girl.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The Jewish butler. He steals from his Jewish masters and
commits race pollution.” (<span class='it'>M-40</span>).</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pageno' title='699' id='Page_699'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Another article appearing in “<span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span>,” written by
Streicher’s editor, Karl Holz, states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The revenge will break loose one day and will exterminate
Jewry from the surface of the earth.” (<span class='it'>M-35</span>).</p>

</div>

<p>Again, in September 1938, “<span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span>” published an article
describing the Jews as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“A parasite, an enemy, an evil-doer, a disseminator of diseases
who must be destroyed in the interest of mankind.”
(<span class='it'>M-36</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This is no longer propaganda for the persecution of the Jews;
this is propaganda for the extermination of Jews, and for the
murder not of one Jew but of all Jews (see <span class='it'>2698-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>A picture published in “<span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span>” in December 1938 shows
a girl being strangled by a man whose hands are around her
neck. The shadow of the man’s face, which is shown against
the background, has quite obvious Jewish features. The caption
under that picture is as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Castration for Race Polluters. Only heavy penalties will
preserve our womenfolk from a tighter grip from ghastly
Jewish claws. The Jews are our misfortune.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>The Anti-Jewish demonstrations of November 1938.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>While his anti-Jewish propaganda was becoming constantly
fiercer, Streicher took a leading part in the organized demonstrations
against the Jews which took place on 9 and 10 November
1938. In the autumn of that year, on the occasion of a meeting
of press representatives in Nurnberg, Streicher organized the
breaking-up of the Nurnberg synagogues. It was announced that
Streicher personally would set the crane in motion with which
the Jewish symbols would be torn down from the synagogues
(<span class='it'>1724-PS</span>). The event was described as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * the synagogue is being demolished! Julius
Streicher himself inaugurates the work by a speech lasting
more than an hour and a half. By his order—so to speak as a
prelude of the demolition—the tremendous Star of David
came off the cupola.” (<span class='it'>2711-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Streicher took active part in the November demonstrations of
that year, particularly in his <span class='it'>Gau</span> of Franconia. The Nurnberg
demonstrations were reported as follows in the “<span class='it'>Fraenkische
Tageszeitung</span>,” which was Streicher’s paper, on 11 November:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * In Nurnberg and Furth it resulted in demonstrations
by the crowd against the Jewish murders. These lasted
until the early hours of the morning. Far too long had one
watched the activities of the Jews in Germany.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p><span class='pageno' title='700' id='Page_700'></span></p>

<p>“After midnight the excitement of the populace reached its
peak and a large crowd marched to the synagogues in Nurnberg
and Furth and burned these two Jewish buildings,
where the murder of Germans had been preached.</p>

<p>“The fire-brigades, which had been notified immediately, saw
to it that the fire was continued[<a href='#fire'><span class='it'>sic</span></a>] to the original outbreak.
The windows of the Jewish shopkeepers, who still had not
given up hope of selling their junk to the stupid Goims,
were smashed. Thanks to the disciplined behavior of the
SA men and the police, who had rushed to the scene, there
was no plundering.” (<span class='it'>M-42</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 10 November, the day of the demonstrations, Streicher
made a speech stating in part as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“From the cradle, the Jew is not being taught, like we are,
such texts as, ‘Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself,’ or
‘If you are smitten on the left cheek, offer then your right
one.’ No, he is told: ‘With the non-Jew you can do whatever
you like.’ He is even taught that the slaughtering of a non-Jew
is an act pleasing to God. For 20 years we have been
writing about this in ‘<span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span>’; for 20 years we have
been preaching it throughout the world and we have made
millions recognize the truth.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The Jew slaughtered in one night 75,000 people; when he
emigrated to Egypt he killed all the first-born, i.e. a whole
future generation of Egyptians. What would have happened
if the Jew had succeeded in driving the nations into war
against us, and if we had lost the war? The Jew protected
by foreign bayonets, would have fallen on us and would have
slaughtered and murdered us. Never forget what history
has taught us.” (<span class='it'>M-41</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>After the November 1938 demonstrations, irregularities occurred
in the Gau of Franconia in connection with the organized
Aryanization of Jewish property. Aryanization of Jewish property
was regulated by the Nazi State, which had decreed that the
proceeds of the transfer of Jewish properties to Aryans were to
go to the State. In Streicher’s <span class='it'>Gau</span> of Franconia, however, a
good deal of the proceeds never found their way as far as the
State. As a result Goering set up a commission to investigate
what had taken place. The report of that commission (<span class='it'>1757-PS</span>)
describes what had been taking place in Streicher’s <span class='it'>Gau</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * Following upon the November demonstrations the
Deputy Gauleiter, Holz, took up the Jewish questions. His
<span class='pageno' title='701' id='Page_701'></span>
reasons can be given here in detail on the basis of his statement
of the 25th of March, 1939:</p>

<p>“The 9th and 10th of November 1938.</p>

<p>“In the night of the 9th and 10th November and on the 10th
of November 1938, events took place throughout Germany
which I [Holz] considered to be the signal for a completely
different treatment of the Jewish question in Germany. Synagogues
and Jewish schools were burnt down and Jewish property
was smashed both in shops and in private houses. Besides
this, a large number of particular Jews were taken to
concentration camps by the police. Toward midday we discussed
these events in the Gauleiter’s house. All of us were
of the opinion that we now faced a completely new state of
affairs on the Jewish question. By the great action against
the Jews, carried out in the night and morning of the 10th
of November, all guiding principles and all laws on the subject
had been made illusory. We were of the opinion (particularly
myself) that we should now act on our own initiative
in this respect. I proposed to the Gauleiter that in view
of the great existing lack of housing, the best thing would
be to put the Jews into a kind of internment camp. Then
the houses would become free in a twinkling, and the housing
shortage would be relieved, at least in part. Besides that, we
would have the Jews under control and supervision. I added
‘The same thing happened to our prisoners of war and war
internees.’ The Gauleiter said that this suggestion was for
the time being impossible to carry out. Thereupon I made
a new proposal to him. I said that I considered it unthinkable
that, after the Jews had had their property smashed, they
should continue to be able to own houses and land. I proposed
that these houses and this land ought to be taken away
from them, and declared myself ready to carry through such
an action. I declared that by the Aryanization of Jewish land
and houses a large sum could accrue to the Gau out of the
proceeds. I named some million of marks. I stated that, in
my opinion, this Aryanization could be carried out as legally
as the Aryanization of shops. The Gauleiter’s answer
was something to this effect: ‘If you think you can carry this
out, do so. The sum gained will then be used to build a Gau
school.’ ”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The Aryanization was accomplished by the alienation of
<span class='pageno' title='702' id='Page_702'></span>
properties, the surrender of claims, especially mortgage
claims, and reductions in buying price.</p>

<p>“The payment allowed the Jews was basically 10% of the
nominal value or nominal sum of the claim. As a justification
for these low prices, Holz claimed at the Berlin meeting of
the 6th of February 1939, that the Jews had mostly bought
their property during the inflation period for a tenth of its
value. As has been shown by investigating a large number
of individual cases selected at random, this claim is not true.”
(<span class='it'>1757-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The second part of this report, which contains the findings of
the commission, reads in part as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * Gauleiter Streicher likes to beat people with a riding
whip but only if he is in the company of several persons
assisting him. Usually the beatings are carried out with sadistic
brutality.</p>

<p>“The best known case is that of Steinruck, whom he beat
bloodily in the prison cell, together with Deputy Gauleiter
Holz and SA Brigadier General Koenig. After returning
from this scene to the <span class='it'>Deutscher Hof</span> he said: ‘Now I am relieved.
I needed that again!’ Later he also stated several
times that he needed another Steinruck case in order to ‘relieve’
himself.</p>

<p>“In August 1938, he beat Editor Burker at the District House
together with District Office Leader Schoeller and his Adjutant
Koenig.</p>

<p>“On the 2nd of December 1938 he asked to have three youthful
criminals (15 to 17 years old) who had been arrested for
robbery brought to the room of the director of the Criminal
Police Office in Nurnberg-Furth. Streicher, who was accompanied
by his son, Lothar, had the youths brought in singly
and question them about their sex life and in particular,
through clear and detailed questioning, he laid stress on determining
whether and since when they masturbated. * * *</p>

<p>“* * * The last one of these three boys he beat with his
riding whip, with blows on the head and on the rest of the
body.” (<span class='it'>1757-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A later passage shows the authority and power which Streicher
held in his Gau:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“According to reports of reliable witnesses Gauleiter
Streicher is in the habit of pointing out on the most varied
occasions that he alone gives orders in the district of Franconia.
For instance, at a meeting in the Colosseum in Nurnberg
<span class='pageno' title='703' id='Page_703'></span>
in 1935 he said that nobody could remove him from
office. In a meeting at Herkules Hall, where he described
how he had beaten Professor Steinruck, he emphasized that
he would not let himself be beaten by anybody, not even by
an Adolf Hitler.</p>

<p>“For, this also must be stated here, in Franconia the Gau
acts first and then orders the absolutely powerless authorities
to approve.” (<span class='it'>1757-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That report shows the kind of treatment and persecution
which the Jews were receiving in the Gau over which Streicher
ruled. It further shows the absolute authority with which
Streicher acted in his district.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a result either of that investigation or of some other matter,
Streicher was relieved of his position as Gauleiter in February
1940, but he did not cease from propaganda or from control
of his newspaper. In an article written in “<span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span>,”
on 4 November 1943, Streicher declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is really the truth that the Jews, so to speak, have disappeared
from Europe and that the Jewish reservoir of the
East, from which the Jewish plague has for centuries beset
the peoples of Europe, has ceased to exist. However, the
Fuehrer of the German people at the beginning of the war
prophesied what has now come to pass.” (<span class='it'>1965-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That article, signed by Streicher, shows that he had knowledge
of the Jewish exterminations which were going on in the East.
Streicher’s article was written in November 1943. In April
1943 the Warsaw ghetto was destroyed. Between April 1942
and April 1944 more than 1,700,000 Jews were killed in Auschwitz
and Dachau. It seems clear from this article that Streicher
knew what was happening, perhaps not the details, but the fact
that Jews were being exterminated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>Perversion of Youth.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Streicher paid particular attention to the instruction and perversion
of the children and youth of Germany. He was not content
with inciting the German population. He started to poison
the minds of the children at school at the earliest possible date.
He continually emphasized the need for teaching children anti-semitism.
In a speech as early as June 1925 Streicher said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I repeat, we demand the transformation of the school into
a national German institution of education. If we let German
children be taught by German teachers, then we shall
have laid the foundations for the national German school.
This national German school must teach racial doctrine.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p><span class='pageno' title='704' id='Page_704'></span></p>

<p>“We demand, therefore, the introduction of racial doctrine
into the school.” (<span class='it'>M-30</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The “<span class='it'>Fraenkische Tageszeitung</span>” of 19 March 1934 reports
Streicher’s address at a girls’ school at Preisslerstrasse:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Then Julius Streicher spoke about his life and told them
about a girl who at one time went to his school and who fell
for a Jew and was finished for the rest of her life.” (<span class='it'>M-43</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Every summer in Nurnberg a youth celebration was held. At
this pagan rite the youth of Nurnberg were rallied, organized, and
incited, encouraged by Streicher. Streicher’s speech to the Hitler
Youth on the “Holy Mountain” near Nurnberg on 22 June 1935
contained the following statements:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Boys and girls, look back to a little more than 10 years ago.
A great war—the World War—had whirled over the peoples
of the earth and had left in the end a heap of ruins. Only
one people remained victorious in this dreadful war, a people
of whom Christ said its father is the devil. That people had
ruined the German nation in body and soul. Then Adolf
Hitler, unknown to anybody, arose from among the people
and became the voice which called to a holy war and battle.
He cried to the people for everybody to take courage again
and to rise and get a helping hand to take the devil from the
German people, so that the human race might be free again
from these people that have wandered about the world for
centuries and millenia, marked with the sign of Cain.</p>

<p>“Boys and girls, even if they say that the Jews were once
the chosen people, do not believe it, but believe us when we
say that the Jews are not a chosen people. Because it cannot
be that a chosen people should act among the peoples as
the Jews do today.” (<span class='it'>M-1</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A report of Streicher’s address to 2,000 children at Nurnberg
at Christmas-time, 1936, states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“ ‘Do you know who the Devil is,’ he asked his breathlessly
listening audience. ‘The Jew, the Jew,’ resounded from a
thousand children’s voices.” (<span class='it'>M-44</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Streicher was not content with writing and talking. He
issued a book for teachers, written by one Fink and published
from the “<span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span>” offices, called “The Jewish Question
and School Instruction.” This book emphasizes the necessity
of anti-semitic teaching in schools, and suggests ways in which
the subject can be introduced and handled. The preface, written
by Streicher, reads in part as follows:
<span class='pageno' title='705' id='Page_705'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The National Socialist state brought fundamental changes
into all spheres of life of the German people.</p>

<p>“It has also presented the German teacher with some new
tasks. The National Socialist state demands that its teachers
instruct German children in social questions. As far as
the German people is concerned the racial question is a Jewish
question. Those who want to teach the child all about
the Jew must themselves have a thorough knowledge of the
subject.</p>

<p>“Those who take to heart all that has been written with such
feeling by Fritz Fink, who for many years has been greatly
concerned about the German people, will be grateful for the
creator of this outwardly insignificant publication.” (<span class='it'>M-46</span>).</p>

<p>The preface is signed by Julius Streicher, City of the Reich
Party Rallies, Nurnberg, in the year 1937.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The introduction to this book reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Racial and Jewish questions are the fundamental problems
of the National Socialist ideology. The solution of
these problems will secure the existence of National Socialism
and with this the existence of our nation for all time.
The enormous significance of the racial question is recognized
almost without exception today by all the German
people. In order to attain this recognition our people had to
travel through a long road of suffering.</p>

<p>“No one should be allowed to grow up in the midst of our
people without this knowledge of the monstrous character
and dangerousness of the Jew.” (<span class='it'>M-46</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A later passage in the book contains this statement:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“One who has reached this stage of understanding will inevitably
remain an enemy of the Jews all his life and will
instill this hatred into his own children.” (<span class='it'>M-46</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span>” also published some children’s books. Although
Streicher himself did not write the books, they were published
from his publishing business, and they are on the same line of
everything else published and issued from that business. Among
these books was one entitled “Don’t trust the Fox in the green
meadow nor the Jew on his oath.” It is a picture book for children.
The pictures all depict Jews in an offensive light. And
opposite each picture there is a little story. For instance, opposite
one picture, which portrays an unpleasant-looking Jewish
butcher cutting up meat, there appears the following comment:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Jewish butcher: he sells half refuse instead of meat.
A piece of meat lies on the floor; the cat claws another. This
doesn’t worry the Jew butcher since the meat increases in
<span class='pageno' title='706' id='Page_706'></span>
weight. Besides one mustn’t forget he won’t have to eat it
himself.” (<span class='it'>M-32</span>).</p>

</div>

<p>The story opposite another picture reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Jesus Christ says ‘The Jew is a murderer through and
through’. And when Christ had to die the Lord didn’t know
any other people who would have tortured Him to death so
he chose the Jews. That is why the Jews pride themselves
on being the chosen people.” (<span class='it'>M-32</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Other pictures in this book portray: a girl being led away by
an evil-appearing Jew; Streicher smiling benignly at a children’s
party, greeting the little children; children looking at copies of
“<span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span>” posted on a wall; Jewish children being taken
away from an Aryan school by an unpleasant-looking father,
with all the Aryan children shouting and dancing and enjoying
the fun very much (<span class='it'>M-32</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another book, called “The Poisonous Fungus,” is very similar
in character and appearance, and likewise calculated to poison the
minds of readers. One of the pictures in this book shows a girl
sitting in a Jewish doctor’s waiting room. The story that goes
with this picture is not a very pleasant story, but it is only by
adverting to these matters that it becomes possible to believe the
kind of education which German children received from Streicher.
The story reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Inge sits in the reception room of the Jew doctor. She has
to wait a long time. She looks through the journals which
are on the table. But she is much too nervous to read even a
few sentences. Again and again she remembers the talk
with her mother. And again and again her mind reflects on
the warnings of her leader of the League of German Girls:
‘A German must not consult a Jew doctor. And particularly
not a German girl. Many a girl that went to a Jew doctor
to be cured, found disease and disgrace!’</p>

<p>“When Inge had entered the waiting room, she experienced
an extraordinary incident. From the doctor’s consulting
room she could hear the sound of crying. She heard the
voice of a young girl: ‘Doctor, doctor, leave me alone!’</p>

<p>“Then she heard the scornful laughing of a man. And then,
all of a sudden, it became absolutely silent. Inge had listened
breathlessly.</p>

<p>“ ‘What may be the meaning of all this?’ she asked herself
and her heart was pounding. And again she thought of the
warning of her leader in the League of German Girls.</p>

<p>“Inge was already waiting for an hour. Again she takes the
<span class='pageno' title='707' id='Page_707'></span>
journals in an endeavor to read. Then the door opens. Inge
looks up. The Jew appears. She screams. In terror she
drops the paper. Horrified she jumps up. Her eyes stare
into the face of the Jewish doctor. And this face is the face
of the devil. In the middle of this devil’s face is a huge
crooked nose. Behind the spectacles two criminal eyes. And
the thick lips are grinning, a grinning that expresses: ‘Now
I got you at last, you little German girl!’</p>

<p>“And then the Jew approaches her. His fleshy fingers stretch
out after her. But now Inge has composed herself. Before
the Jew can grab hold of her, she smacks the fat face of
the Jew doctor with her hand. One jump to the door. Breathlessly
Inge runs down the stairs. Breathlessly she escapes
the Jew house.” (<span class='it'>1778-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Another photograph shows youthful admirers standing around
looking at Streicher’s picture, with the following commentary:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“ ‘Without a solution of the Jewish question there will be no
salvation for mankind.’ That is what he shouted to us. All
of us could understand him. And when, at the end, he
shouted ‘<span class='it'>Sieg Heil</span>’ for the Fuehrer, we all acclaimed him
with tremendous enthusiasm. For two hours Streicher
spoke at that occasion. To us it appeared to have been but
a few minutes.” (<span class='it'>1778-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The effect of all this propaganda is evident from the columns
of “<span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span>” itself. In April 1936 there was published a
letter, which is typical of many others that appear in other copies
from children of all ages. The third paragraph of this letter,
signed by the boys and girls of the National Socialist Youth Hostel
at Grossmuellen, reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * Today we saw a play on how the devil persuades
the Jew to shoot a conscientious National Socialist. In the
course of the play the Jew did it too. We all heard the shot.
We would have all liked to jump up and arrest the Jew. But
then the policeman came and after a short struggle took the
Jew along. You can imagine, dear <span class='it'>Stuermer</span>, that we heartily
cheered the policeman. In the whole play not one name was
mentioned, but we all knew that this play represented the
murder by the Jew Frankfurter. We were very sick when
we went to bed that night. None felt like talking to the
others. This play made it clear to us how the Jew sets to
work.” (<span class='it'>M-25</span>).</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pageno' title='708' id='Page_708'></span></p>

<h3>C. <span class='it'>STREICHER’S USE OF HIS AUTHORITY AS GAULEITER IN THE SERVICE OF THE CONSPIRACY.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Streicher’s authority as a Gauleiter was extensive. The Organization
Book of the NSDAP for 1938 describes the duties and authority
of Gauleiters as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Gauleiter bears over-all responsibility for the Fuehrer
for the sector of sovereignty entrusted to him. The rights,
duties and jurisdiction of the Gauleiter result primarily from
the mission assigned by the Fuehrer and, apart from that,
from detailed direction.” (<span class='it'>1814-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Streicher’s association with the Fuehrer and other Nazi conspirators
may also be seen from the newspapers. On the occasion
of Streicher’s 50th birthday, Hitler paid a visit to Nurnberg to
congratulate him. The account of that meeting is published in
the “<span class='it'>Voelkischer Beobachter</span>” of 13 February 1934 as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Adolf Hitler spoke to his old comrades in battle and to his
followers in words which went straight to their hearts. By
way of introduction he remarked that it was a special pleasure
to be present for a short while in Nurnberg, the town of
the National Socialist community which had been steeled in
battle, at this day of honor of Julius Streicher, and to be
within the circle of the standard bearers of the National
Socialist idea during many years.</p>

<p>“Just as they, all of them, had during the years of oppression
unshakeably believed in the victory of the movement,
so his friend and comrade in the battle, Streicher, had stood
faithfully at his side at all times. It had been this unshakeable
belief that had moved mountains.</p>

<p>“For Streicher it would surely be a solemn thought, that this
50th anniversary meant not only the halfway point of a
century, but also of a thousand years of German history to
him. He had in Streicher a companion of whom he could say
that here in Nurnberg was a man who would never waver for
a single second and who would unflinchingly stand behind him
in every situation.” (<span class='it'>M-8</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A letter from Himmler, published in “<span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span>” of April
1937, declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“If in future years the history of the reawakening of the
German people is written, and if already the next generation
will be unable to understand that the German people was
once friendly to the Jews, it will be stated that Julius
Streicher and his weekly paper ‘<span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span>’ have contributed
a great deal towards the enlightenment regarding the
<span class='pageno' title='709' id='Page_709'></span>
enemy of humanity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“(Signed) For the Reichsfuehrer SS,
Himmler.” (<span class='it'>M-22</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, a letter from von Schirach, the Reich Youth Leader,
published in “<span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span>” of January 1938, had this to say:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“It is the historical merit of ‘<span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span>’ to have enlightened
the broad masses of our people in a popular way as to
the Jewish world danger. ‘<span class='it'>Der Stuermer</span>’ is right in refusing
to fulfill its task in the tone of the aesthetic drawing
room. Jewry has shown no regard for the German people.
We have, therefore, no cause to be considerate and to spare
our worst enemy. What we fail to do today our youngsters
of tomorrow will have to suffer for bitterly.” (<span class='it'>M-45</span>).</p>

</div>

<h3>D. <span class='it'>CONCLUSION.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>It may be that Streicher is less directly involved in the physical
commission of the crimes against Jews than some of his coconspirators.
The submission of the Prosecution is that his crime
is no less worse for that reason. No government in the world,
before the Nazis came to power, could have embarked upon and
put into effect a policy of mass Jewish extermination in the way
in which they did, without having a people who would back them
and support them, and without having a large number of people
who were prepared to carry out the murder themselves. (See
Chapter XII on Persecution of the Jews.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was to the task of educating and poisoning the people with
hate, and of producing murderers, that Streicher set himself. For
25 years he continued unrelentingly the perversion of the people
and youth of Germany. He went on and on, as he saw the results
of his work bearing fruit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the early days he was preaching persecution. As persecution
took place he preached extermination and annihilation and, as
millions of Jews were exterminated and annihilated, in the Ghettos
of the East, he cried out for more and more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crime of Streicher is that he made these crimes possible,
which they would never have been had it not been for him and
for those like him. Without Streicher and his propaganda, the
Kaltenbrunners, the Himmlers, the General Stroops would have
had nobody to do their orders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In its extent Streicher’s crime is probably greater and more
far-reaching than that of any of the other defendants. The misery
which they caused ceased with their capture. The effects of
this man’s crime, of the poison that he has put into the minds
of millions of young boys and girls goes on, for he concentrated
<span class='pageno' title='710' id='Page_710'></span>
upon the youth and childhood of Germany. He leaves behind him
a legacy of almost a whole people poisoned with hate, sadism,
and murder, and perverted by him. That people remain a problem
and perhaps a menace to the rest of civilization for generations
to come.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='pageno' title='715' id='Page_715'></span>11. WALTER FUNK</h2>

<h3>A. <span class='it'>FUNK ACTIVELY PROMOTED THE CONSPIRATORS’ ACCESSION TO POWER.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>A recital of Funk’s positions and activities is set forth in a
statement made by him (<span class='it'>3533-PS</span>). Although Funk signed this
statement, he inserted several reservations and denials with respect
to certain positions and activities. Funk’s submissions in
this connection, which are indicated in his statement (<span class='it'>3533-PS</span>)
should be evaluated in the light of the statements set forth in the
collection of relevant excerpts from German publications (<span class='it'>3563-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>An examination of these excerpts will reveal that the German
publications directly contradict every contention which Funk has
made with respect to his holding the positions and carrying on the
activities listed in his statement (<span class='it'>3533-PS</span>). For example, in his
comment concerning item (<span class='it'>b</span>) of his statement Funk denies that
he was Hitler’s Personal Economic Adviser during the 1930’s. On
the other hand, there are four German publications, each of which
states unequivocally that Funk <span class='it'>was</span> Hitler’s Personal Economic
Adviser (<span class='it'>3563-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>As is indicated by these documents, Funk, soon after he joined
the Nazi Party in 1931, began to hold important positions in the
Party and soon qualified as one of the Nazi inner circle. Thus,
he promptly became not only Hitler’s Personal Economic Adviser,
but also Chief of the Economic Division of the Central Nazi Party
Directorate and Chairman of the Party’s Committee on Economic
Policy (<span class='it'>3533-PS</span>). In these capacities, he advanced the Party’s
drive for mass support by drafting its economic slogans. In 1932,
for example, he wrote a pamphlet entitled “Economic Reconstruction
Program of the NSDAP”, which, after its approval by Hitler,
became the Party’s official pronouncement on economic matters
(<span class='it'>3505-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Funk also served as the liaison man between the Nazi Party
and the large industrialists, from whom he obtained financial and
political support on Hitler’s behalf (<span class='it'>3505-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2828-PS</span>). Thus,
for example, he was present at the meeting of approximately 25
leading industrialists held in Berlin on 20 February 1933 (<span class='it'>2828-PS</span>).
In the course of this meeting, which was arranged by Goering
and attended by Funk, among others, and which was designed
to obtain the industrialists’ financial and political support for the
Nazi program, Hitler and Goering announced some of the fundamental
Nazi objectives: the destruction of the parliamentary system
<span class='pageno' title='716' id='Page_716'></span>
in Germany; the crushing of all internal opposition by force,
the restoration of the power of the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>. In addition, Hitler
indicated that force was to be used in solving problems with
other nations (<span class='it'>D-203</span>). The financial and political support for the
Nazis which Funk secured from industry promoted the campaign
of force and terror by which the Nazis seized and consolidated
their control of Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The importance of Funk’s general contribution to the conspirators’
accession to power has been described in a book published by
the Central Publishing House of the Nazi Party:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“No less important than Funk’s accomplishments in the programmatic
field in the years 1931 and 1932 was his activity
of that time as the Fuehrer’s liaison man to the leading men
of the German economy in industry, trade, commerce and
finance. On the basis of his past work, his personal relations
to the German economic leaders were broad and extensive.
He was now able to enlist them in the service of Adolf Hitler,
and not only to answer their questions authoritatively, but to
convince them and win their backing for the Party. At that
time, that was terribly important work. Every success
achieved meant a moral, political, and economic strengthening
of the fighting force of the Party and contributed toward
destroying the prejudice that National Socialism is merely
a party of class hatred and class struggle.” (<span class='it'>3505-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>After he had helped Hitler become Chancellor, Funk, as Reich
Press Chief, participated in the early cabinet meetings, in the
course of which the conspirators determined upon the means by
which they would secure the passage of the Enabling Act and
destroy parliamentary government in Germany (<span class='it'>2962-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2963-PS</span>).
This law destroyed civil liberties in Germany and marked
the conspirators’ seizure of political control over Germany.</p>

<h3>B. <span class='it'>FUNK, BY VIRTUE OF HIS ACTIVITIES IN THE MINISTRY OF PROPAGANDA, ACTIVELY PARTICIPATED IN THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE CONSPIRATORS’ CONTROL OVER GERMANY.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazis created a vast propaganda machine which they
used to proclaim the doctrine of the master race, to inveigh
against the Jews, to impose the leadership principle upon the
German people, to glorify war as a noble activity, to create the
social cohesion necessary for war, and to weaken the capacity and
willingness of their intended victims to resist aggression. (See
<span class='pageno' title='717' id='Page_717'></span>
Section 9 of Chapter VII on Propaganda, Censorship and Supervision
of Cultural Activities.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The operation of this propaganda machine was principally the
responsibility of the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and
Propaganda. Funk played a significant role in the operations
of that Ministry and in related agencies of the Nazi State. On
30 January 1933, the day on which Hitler became Reich Chancellor,
Funk was appointed Press Chief of the Reich Government.
In that capacity, and even after the establishment of the Ministry
of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, he reported regularly
to Hitler and President von Hindenburg (<span class='it'>3505-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3501-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 13 March 1933, the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment
and Propaganda was established with Goebbels as its Chief
and Funk as its under-Secretary (<span class='it'>2029-PS</span>; <span class='it'>Voelkischer Beobachter</span>
15 March 1933, p. 2. (South German Edition)). In an interview
with a reporter from the <span class='it'>Voelkischer Beobachter</span> on 30
March 1933, Funk made clear the importance which propaganda
was to have in the Nazi State. He stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Propaganda is the most modern instrument of power and
fighting weapon of state policy. The establishing of the
Propaganda Ministry is vital, for the national political
policy of the new State Leadership is to be the general good
of the whole people. Therefore, the total political, artistic,
cultural and spiritual life of the nation, must be brought on
to one level and directed from one central point.” (Voelkischer
Beobachter, South German Edition, 31 March 1933).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In order to achieve this purpose, the Ministry of Enlightenment
and Propaganda was organized so as to reach and control
every medium of expression within Germany. In the language
of the decree defining the duties of the Minister of Propaganda,
he was to have</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * jurisdiction over the whole field of spiritual indoctrination
of the nation, of propagandizing the State, of
cultural and economic propaganda, of enlightenment of the
public at home and abroad; furthermore, he is in charge of
all institutions serving these purposes.” (<span class='it'>2030-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Under this decree, the Ministry controlled propaganda abroad,
propaganda within Germany, the press, music, the theater, films,
art, literature, radio and all related institutions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Funk discharged important responsibilities in the Ministry. As
Undersecretary, he was Goebbels’ chief aide. In this capacity
he appears to have been the primary organizer of the machine
from which flowed Nazi propaganda. This is made clear by the
following excerpt from an affidavit dated 19 December 1945, and
<span class='pageno' title='718' id='Page_718'></span>
signed by Max Amann, who held the position of Reich Leader
of the Press and President of the Reich Press Chamber.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * In carrying out my duties and responsibilities,
I became familiar with the operations and the organization
of the Reich Ministry of Propaganda and Enlightenment.</p>

<p>“Walther Funk was the practical Minister of the Ministry of
Propaganda and Enlightenment and managed the Ministry.
Funk was the soul of the Ministry, and without him Goebbels
could not have built it up. Goebbels once stated to me
that Funk was his ‘most effective man.’ Funk exercised
comprehensive control over all the media of expression in
Germany: over the press, the theater, radio and music. As
Press Chief of the Reich Government and subsequently as
Under Secretary of the Ministry, Funk held daily meetings
with the Fuehrer and a daily press conference in the course
of which he issued the directives governing the materials to
be published by the German press”. (<span class='it'>3501-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A note for the files prepared by one Sigismund, an SS Scharfuehrer,
also stresses the important role which Funk played in
The Ministry of Propaganda (<span class='it'>3566-PS</span>). That note records a
discussion between Sigismund and one Weinbrenner, an official
of the Ministry of Propaganda, about the selection of a General
Manager for the German Radio. The note states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Weinbrenner made the following statement: * * * it is
almost impossible to determine whom the Minister would
name General Manager, since Dr. Goebbels reaches most of
the important decisions only by agreement with Under
Secretary Funk.” (<span class='it'>3566-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to his position as Undersecretary, Funk had many
other important responsibilities in subordinate offices of the
Ministry for Propaganda (<span class='it'>3533-PS</span>). In 1933, for example, he
was appointed Vice President of the Reich Chamber of Culture,
whose President was Goebbels (<span class='it'>3533-PS</span>; <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, 1933,
I, p. 798).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Funk’s position as Vice President of the Reich Chamber of
Culture was related to his position as Undersecretary of the Ministry,
since the Chamber of Culture and the seven subordinate
chambers were by law subject to the control of the Ministry of
Propaganda (<span class='it'>2082-PS</span>). This control was insured in practice by
placing officers of the Ministry of Propaganda in the highest positions
of the Chambers. Thus, for example, Goebbels was its
President and Funk its Vice President. By virtue of his dual
position, Funk directly promoted two fundamental and related
<span class='pageno' title='719' id='Page_719'></span>
Nazi policies: (1) the regimentation of all creative activities in
the interest of Nazi political and military objectives; (2) the
elimination of Jews and dissidents from the so-called cultural
professions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mechanics by which these policies were carried out have
been described in Section 9 of Chapter VII on Propaganda, Censorship
and Supervision of Cultural Activities. That description
will be supplemented here only by reference to the second decree
for the Execution of the Law of Reich Chamber of Culture, dated
9 November 1933 (<span class='it'>2872-PS</span>). This decree, which was signed
by Funk, representing Goebbels, fixed the effective date for the
entire scheme for the domination and purging of the cultural
professions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The control of the Ministry of Propaganda was based in part
on the requirement that persons engaged in so-called “cultural
activities” belong to the appropriate Chamber (<span class='it'>1933 Reichsgesetzblatt</span>,
I, p. 797). Decrees were then passed which prescribed
standards of admission to these Chambers, which automatically
excluded Jews. For example, in the field of journalism,
“only persons who were of Aryan descent and not married to a
person of non-Aryan descent” were permitted to be so-called
<span class='it'>Schriftleiter</span>, that is, to perform any work relating to the contents
of a newspaper or a political magazine (<span class='it'>2083-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Similarly, newspaper publishers had to submit proof tracing
their Aryan descent (and that of their spouses) as far back as
the year 1800 (Decree 24 April 1935, issued by the President of
the Reich Press Chamber, Article 1, 3 and Article II, 1(f) and 2,
reprinted in Karl Friedrich Schrieber in “<span class='it'>Das Recht der Reichskulturkammer</span>”,
vol. 2, 1935, pp. 109-112; Decrees 15 April and
22 May 1936 issued by the President of Reich Press Chamber
reprinted in Karl Friedrich Schrieber “<span class='it'>Das Recht der Reichskulturkammer</span>”,
vol. 4, 1936, pp. 101-102, 120-122; see also:
Decree 17 September 1934 reprinted in Karl Friedrich Schrieber’s
“<span class='it'>Das Recht der Reichskulturkammer</span>”, vol. 2, 1935, p. 79).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In view of Funk’s official positions and the policies which he
advanced, it is natural that Nazi writers have stressed his contribution
to the perversion of German culture. Thus Oestreich’s
biography of Funk states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Besides, Funk had a special duty from his Ministry received
the task to take care of the cultural life. In this
position he organized quietly a tremendous concern which
represented an investment of many hundreds of millions.
In close co-operation with the Reich Leader of the Press,
Max Amann, the economic fundamentals of the German
<span class='pageno' title='720' id='Page_720'></span>
press were reconstructed according to the political necessities.
The same took place in the film industry and in other
cultural fields.” (<span class='it'>3505-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The reconstruction of “the economic fundamentals of the German
press * * * and other cultural fields” was a biographer’s
euphemism for the elimination of Jews and dissidents from the
field of literature, music, theater, journalism, broadcasting, and
the arts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The completeness with which the policy of cultural extermination
was carried out is made clear by a pamphlet entitled “The
Reich Ministry for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda”, by
Georg Wilhelm Mueller, an official of the Ministry of Propaganda,
which was published by the German Academy for Politics as part
of a series on the organization of the Nazi Government. That
pamphlet states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Department Special Cultural Tasks (a department within
the Ministry of Propaganda) serves mainly the purpose
to remove the Jews from cultural professions. It reviews
the political attitude of all artistic or cultural workers and
cultural economic enterprises that are members of the seven
individual chambers of the Reich Chamber of Culture (except
the Reich Chamber of the Press), it has to supervise
the removal of Jews in the entire field of the seven individual
chambers and settles as highest authority all complaints and
appeals of cultural workers whose membership was rejected
by the Chamber because of lack of proof of Aryan descent.
At the same time, it is the task of this department to supervise
the activities of non-Aryans in the intellectual and entire
cultural field, therefore, also the supervision of the only Jewish
organization in the cultural field in the entire Reich territory,
that is, the ‘Jewish <span class='it'>Kulturbund</span>’ (Jewish Cultural Association).</p>

<p>“In this way this department also cooperates with all other
professional departments of the Ministry or the Chambers
by consulting the local officials of the party, the State police
offices, etc., and when supervising the Jewish ‘cultural work’
with the political police.</p>

<p>“It is mainly the merit of this department—to 1937 a
department in the Managing Office of the Reich Chamber of
Culture—that the purge of the entire German cultural life
from Jewish or other non-German influences was completely
accomplished according to the assignments of the Minister.”
(<span class='it'>Das Reichsministerium fuer Volksaufklaerung und Propaganda</span>
<span class='pageno' title='721' id='Page_721'></span>
(Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda)
pp. 30-31).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Funk contributed to the achievement of the Nazi propaganda
program in other capacities. Thus, in 1933, Goebbels appointed
him Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Reich Broadcasting
Company (<span class='it'>3505-PS</span>). That company was the coordinating
authority for all German radio broadcasting and supervised all
German radio stations, with a view to insuring that radio serve
the political purposes of the Nazi State (<span class='it'>Das Deutsche Fuehrerlexikon</span>,
1934-1935, p. 139; <span class='it'>3505-PS</span>). Moreover, in 1933, Funk
was also appointed Vice-president of the <span class='it'>Filmkreditbank</span>. The
<span class='it'>Filmkreditbank</span> was a government-controlled financing corporation
which influenced film production in the interests of the Nazi
program by granting financial assistance in connection with only
those films deemed desirable from the Nazi point of view (Seager,
“<span class='it'>Der Film im Nationalsocialistischen Staat</span>” (“The Film in the
National-Socialist State”), in Frank: “<span class='it'>Nationalsozialistisches
Handbuch fuer Recht und Gesetzgebung</span>” (“National Socialist
Handbook for Law and Legislation”), 1935, 2nd edition, p. 512).
It is clear from the foregoing that Funk was from 1933 until the
end of 1937 a versatile and key figure in the propaganda field.
His activities ranged from daily conferences with the Fuehrer and
the organization of a new large Ministry vital to the Nazi program,
to depriving the most humble Jewish artist of his power
to earn a livelihood. Funk appears to have been what Goebbels
said he was: Goebbels’ “most effective man” (<span class='it'>3501-PS</span>).</p>

<h3>C. <span class='it'>FUNK, AS MINISTER OF ECONOMICS, CONTINUED TO ADVANCE THE CONSPIRACY TO PERSECUTE THE JEWS BY ACTIVELY PARTICIPATING IN THE PLANNING AND EXECUTION OF THE MEASURES WHICH ELIMINATED THE JEWS FROM THE GERMAN ECONOMY.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>The systematic anti-Jewish program of the Nazi conspirators
is discussed in Chapter XII. The evidence discussed below shows
that Funk, by virtue of his activities as Minister of Economics,
is responsible for the planning and execution of the program to
exclude the Jews from the German economy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first record of Funk’s anti-Jewish activities as Minister of
Economics consists of a series of decrees which he signed and
which were designed to exclude the Jews from various occupations,
such as real estate business, auctioneering, etc. Reference
will be made to only a few of these decrees (Decree amending
trade code of 6 July 1938, (<span class='it'>1938 Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, I, p. 832); decree
<span class='pageno' title='722' id='Page_722'></span>
concerning occupation of auctioneers, 12 February 1938,
<span class='it'>1938 Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, I, p. 202. Moreover, on 14 June 1938,
Funk signed a decree providing for the registration of “Jewish
enterprises” (<span class='it'>1938 Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, I, p. 627)). This decree was
part of a system of economic persecution which obliterated Jewish
ownership in all commercial, financial and industrial enterprises.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1938, the death of von Rath in Paris was exploited by the
Nazis as a pretext for intensifying the persecution of the Jews.
Their new anti-Jewish policy called for the complete elimination
of Jews from the economic life of Germany. Funk took a significant
part in both the formulation and execution of this policy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, he was present at the meeting of 12 November 1938,
where, with Goering as the leading spirit, the basis for a more
drastic policy against the Jews was established (<span class='it'>1816-PS</span>).
Goering described the meeting as a decisive one, and demanded
“that the Jewish question be now, once and for all, coordinated
and solved, one way or another.” (<span class='it'>1816-PS</span>). Funk came to the
meeting with a draft law which he had prepared, and which he
submitted with the following explanation:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I have prepared a law elaborating that, effective 1 January
1939, Jews shall be prohibited to operate retail stores and
wholesale establishments, as well as independent artisan
shops. They shall further be prohibited from keeping employees
or offering any ready products on the market. Wherever
a Jewish shop is operated, the police shall shut it down.
From 1 January 1939, a Jew can no longer be employed as an
enterpriser, as stipulated in the law for the Organization of
National Labor from 20 January 1934. If a Jew holds a leading
position in an establishment without being the enterpriser,
his contract may be declared void within 6 weeks by
the enterpriser. With the expiration of the contract, all
claims of the employee, including all claims to maintenance
become obliterated. That is always very disagreeable and a
great danger. A Jew cannot be a member of a corporation;
Jewish members of corporations shall have to be retired by
31 December 1938. A special authorization is unnecessary.
The competent Ministers of the Reich are being authorized
to issue the provision necessary for the execution of this
law.” (<span class='it'>1816-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The substance of Funk’s draft law promptly found its way into
the <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>. On 12 November 1938, Goering signed a
<span class='pageno' title='723' id='Page_723'></span>
decree entitled “For the Elimination of Jews from the German
Economic Life” (<span class='it'>1662-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>An examination of the provisions of the decree will reveal how
well it deserved its title. Thus, Jews were forbidden to operate
retail stores or mail order houses, or to engage independently in
any handicraft, to offer goods or services at markets, or to take
orders therefor (Section I): or to be “leaders” of any industrial
enterprise. That decree also provided that any Jew in an executive
position of an industrial enterprise was subject to notice of
dismissal (Section 2), and that Jews should be excluded from
membership in cooperative organizations (Section 3). Funk was
expressly authorized in Section 4 of the decree to issue the regulations
necessary for implementing its provisions (<span class='it'>1662-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Funk was also authorized to issue the regulations in connection
with another anti-Jewish decree, also issued on 12 November
1938. This decree provided that all damage done to Jewish
enterprises and apartments during the riots of 8, 9, and 10 November,
was to be repaired by the Jewish owners out of their
own pockets, and that claims by German Jews against insurance
companies were to be confiscated in favor of the German Government
(<span class='it'>1938 Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, I, p. 1581).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after the passage of the decree of 12 November, Funk, in
a speech which he delivered on the Jewish question, made it clear
that the program of economic persecution was a part of the larger
program of extermination and boasted of the fact that the new
program insured the complete elimination of the Jews from the
German economy. In the course of this speech, Funk stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The state and the economy constitute a unity. They must
be directed according to the same principles. The best proof
thereof has been rendered by the most recent development of
the Jewish problem in Germany. One cannot exclude the
Jews from the political life, but let them live and work in the
economic sphere. The fact that the last violent explosion of
the disgust of the German people, because of a criminal Jewish
attack against the German people, took place at a time
when we were standing just before the termination of the
economic measures for the elimination of the Jews from the
German economy—this fact is a result of the other fact that
in the last years we had not handled this problem sufficiently
early and consistently. In any event, the basis of a complete
elimination of the Jews also from the economy had already
been laid by the decrees of the Commissioner for the Four
Year Plan, General Field Marshal Goering, who was the first
<span class='pageno' title='724' id='Page_724'></span>
to undertake the solution of this problem. In the meantime,
by means of Aryanization, performed under governmental
supervision, the Jews had already been excluded completely
from the stock exchanges and the banks and almost completely
from the large businesses and all important industrial
enterprises. According to estimates, of the net property of
approximately 7 billion marks, determined pursuant to the
decree for the registration of Jewish property, 2 billion
marks have already been transferred into German possession.”
(<span class='it'>3545-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 3 December 1938, Funk again advanced the policy of economic
extermination by signing a decree which carried out the
promise of the more severe anti-Jewish policy implied in his above
speech (<span class='it'>1409-PS</span>). This decree imposed additional and drastic
economic disabilities upon Jews and subjected their property to
confiscation and forced liquidation. It provided that: owners of
Jewish enterprises could be ordered to sell or liquidate their enterprises
(Section 1); trustees could be appointed for such enterprises,
with the expenses of trusteeship borne by the owner of the
enterprise (Section 2); Jews could be ordered to sell their property
(real estate, etc.) (Section 6); Jews were prohibited from
acquiring any real estate (Section 7); governmental consent was
required for any disposition of real estate (Section 8); Jews were
forced to deposit all stocks, mining shares, bonds, and other securities
with specially designated banks, and accounts had to be
marked “Jewish” (Section 11); Jews were forbidden to acquire,
to give as security, or to sell objects made of gold, platinum, or
silver, precious stones, or pearls, etc. (Section 14); and Jews
could be required to make certain payments to the Reich before
receiving the consent necessary for the transfer of their property
(Section 15). (<span class='it'>1409-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition, many other decrees aiming at the economic ruin of
the Jews were promulgated over the signature of the Minister of
Economics. For example:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>Decree, 23 November 1938, <span class='it'>1938 Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, I, p. 1642,
signed by Brinkmann acting for Funk and containing detailed
rules for the liquidation of Jewish retail stores, etc.;</p>

<p>Decree, 14 December 1938, <span class='it'>1938 Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, I, p. 1902,
also signed by Brinkmann acting for Funk, and providing detailed
rules for the elimination of Jews from industrial enterprises;</p>

<p>Decree, 8 May 1939, <span class='it'>1939 Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, I, p. 895, signed
<span class='pageno' title='725' id='Page_725'></span>
by Dr. Landfried acting for Funk, excluding Jews from the
occupation of travel agents;</p>

<p>Decree, 4 May 1940, <span class='it'>1940 Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, I, p. 730, also
signed by Dr. Landfried acting for Funk, concerning registration
of transfers of Jewish property;</p>

<p>Decree, 14 November 1940, <span class='it'>1940 Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, I, p. 1520,
also signed by Dr. Landfried acting for Funk, establishing a
procedure for setting aside financial arrangements which
Jews, discharged from executive positions of industrial enterprises
prior to 12 November 1938, had made with their
companies.</p>

<p>Extending certain of the above-described decrees to Austria,
see, e.g.:</p>

<p>Decree, 22 August 1942, <span class='it'>1942 Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, I, p. 537,
signed by von Hanneken, acting for Funk;</p>

<p>Decree, 4 December 1940, <span class='it'>1940 Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, I, p. 1564,
signed by Dr. Landfried acting for Funk.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Funk had important responsibilities, not only in the formulation
of anti-Jewish policy and in the drafting of anti-Jewish legislation,
but also in the administration of the conspirators’ anti-Jewish
measures. Funk was the person to whom appeals were
made concerning action taken by subordinate officials in the administration
of the anti-Jewish economic program. In fact, he
was the paramount authority in this field; his decisions were final
and conclusive. For example, he had the final voice in the administrative
hierarchy set up for deciding whether an enterprise
was a Jewish enterprise within the meaning of the decree requiring
the registration of such enterprises (Decree of 14 June 1938,
section 9, <span class='it'>1938 Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, I, p. 628; see also decree of 3
December 1938, section 19, <span class='it'>1938 Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, I, p. 1711; decree,
14 November 1940, <span class='it'>1940 Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, I, p. 1520).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nazi publications have recognized the significant contribution
made by Funk to the anti-Jewish program. Thus Hans Quecke,
an official of the German Ministry of Economics, in describing
the work of the Ministry during Funk’s incumbency, stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“A task of special political significance and economic importance
arose as an absolute necessity out of the National
Socialist conception of state and economy, namely, <span class='it'>the eradication
of Jewish influence from the economy</span>. In this connection,
a wealth of legislative and administrative work,
though temporary, was created for the Ministry. The steps
<span class='pageno' title='726' id='Page_726'></span>
of the work were as follows: definitions of the term ‘Jewish
enterprise’, registration of Jewish property, securing the
‘deployment’ of such property in accordance with the interests
of the German economy, exclusion of Jewish employees
from executive positions, and, finally, re-examination
of steps taken in the de-Judaization of enterprises with a
view to ordering payments to the Reich for the unjust profits
secured in the process of de-Judaization. That task can now
be considered as practically completed in the field of the industrial
economy.” (Building of the Third Reich (<span class='it'>Das Dritte
Reich in Aufbau</span>) Vol. 5, pp. 318-319 (1941)).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, Funk himself, in the course of administering this
program, emphasized the importance of his new role. For example,
on 6 February 1939, he issued a circular in connection with
the administration of the decree of 3 December 1938 which, as
indicated, he himself signed. In that circular, which was published
in the Ministerial Gazette of the Reich and Prussian Ministry
of the Interior (“<span class='it'>Ministerialblatt des Reichs—und Preussischen
Ministeriums des Innern</span>”), for 1939, No. 7, p. 265, Funk
stressed (at p. 265) “the great political and economic importance”
of the anti-Jewish program and stated with respect to the broad
powers conferred by the decree of 3 December 1938, that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * The extent and speed with which they [the powers]
will be utilized, is dependent upon <span class='it'>my</span> orders, to be given
under the general direction of Goering.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the same circular (at p. 265) Funk also emphasized the importance
of the laws for de-Judaization, stating:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The execution of the laws for the economic de-Judaization
will, for a time, impose extraordinary burdens upon the administrative
organization. However, it is expected that the
officers charged with the execution, in view of the great
political and economic importance of the tasks assigned to
them, will bend all their efforts to assure a most rapid, efficient,
and in every way faultless execution of the de-Judaization.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Funk, in an interrogation dated 22 October 1945, admitted and
deplored his responsibility for the economic persecution of the
Jews:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Q. All the decrees excluding the Jews from industry were
yours, were they not?</p>

<p>“A. * * * So far as my participation in this Jewish affair
is concerned, that was my responsibility and I have regretted
it later on that I ever did participate. The Party had
<span class='pageno' title='727' id='Page_727'></span>
always brought pressure to bear on me previously to make me
agree to the confiscation of Jewish property, and I had refused
repeatedly. But later on, when the anti-Jewish measures
and the force used against the Jews came into force,
something legal had to be done to prevent the looting and
confiscation of all Jewish property.</p>

<p>“Q. You know that the looting and all that was done at the
instigation of the Party, don’t you?</p>

<p>“(<span class='it'>Here witness weeps</span>)</p>

<p>“A. Yes, most certainly. That is when I should have left in
1938, of that I am guilty, I am guilty. I admit that I am
a guilty party here.” (<span class='it'>3544-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<h3>D. <span class='it'>FUNK WITH KNOWLEDGE OF THE CONSPIRATORS’ PLANS FOR AGGRESSION, ACTIVELY PARTICIPATED IN MOBILIZING THE GERMAN ECONOMY FOR AGGRESSIVE WAR: HE ALSO PARTICIPATED IN THE WAGING OF AGGRESSIVE WARS AND WAS A MEMBER OF WAR PLANNING AGENCIES WHICH WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR POLICIES AND ACTS CONTRARY TO THE LAWS OF WAR.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Funk was vested with, and carried out, major responsibilities
in connection with the planning and execution of the Nazi program
of economic mobilization for aggression. Thus, in 1938 he
succeeded Schacht as Minister of Economics (<span class='it'>3533-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately before Funk actually took over the Reich Ministry
of Economics there was a major reorganization of its functions,
which integrated the Ministry with the Four Year Plan as the
Supreme Command of the German military economy. The reorganization
was accomplished by Goering, in his capacity as Commissar
for the Four Year Plan, by a decree dated 4 February,
1938 (“The Four Year Plan” (<span class='it'>Der Vierjahresplan</span>) official
monthly bulletin, issued by Goering, Vol. II, 1938, p. 105). Under
this decree, the jurisdiction of the Economics Ministry was defined
as covering the following fields of Germany’s economy: German
raw and working materials, mining, iron industry, power
industry, handicrafts, finance and credit, foreign trade, devisen,
and exports. As a result of this decree, sectors of the German
economy which were strategic in the organization of war and
armaments economy were placed under the immediate control of
Funk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Furthermore, the Reich Office for Economic Development,
charged by the decree, with “research, planning and execution of
the Four Year Plan”, was incorporated into the Reich Ministry
<span class='pageno' title='728' id='Page_728'></span>
of Economics. Similarly, the Reich Office for Soil Research and
the Office of the Reich Commissar for the exploitation of Scrap
Materials were made subject to that Ministry. Thus, it is clear
that the reorganization decree concentrated significant responsibilities
in the hands of Funk and thereby made him one of the
chief agents of economic mobilization during a decisive period.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Subsequently, Funk was, by a secret law, expressly charged
with the task of mobilizing the German economy for war. On 4
September 1938, while the conspirators were engaged in intensive
planning for aggression against Czechoslovakia, Hitler signed a
revision of the so-called Reich Defense Law (<span class='it'>2194-PS</span>). This law
conferred upon Funk substantially the same authority which had
been vested in Schacht by the Reich Defense Law of 21 May 1935
(<span class='it'>2261-PS</span>). The law of 4 September 1938 provided in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“It is the task of the GBW [Chief Plenipotentiary for Economics]
to put all economic forces into the service of the
Reich defense, and to safeguard economically the life of the
German nation. To him are subordinate: the Reich Minister
of Economics, the Reich Minister of Nutrition and Agriculture,
the Reich Minister of Work, the Reich Chief of Forestry,
the Reich Commissar for Price Control. He is furthermore
responsible for directing the financing of the Reich
defense within the realm of the Reich Finance Ministry and
the Reich Bank.</p>

<p>“The GBW must carry out the demands of the OKW which
are of considerable importance for the armed forces; and he
must insure the economic conditions for the production of
the armament industry directed immediately by the OKW according
to its demands. If the demands of the armed forces
cannot be brought into accord with the affairs of economy,
then the Fuehrer and Reich Chancellor decides.</p>

<p>“The GBW has the right within his sphere to issue laws with
the consent of the OKW and GBV which differ from the
existing laws.” (<span class='it'>2194-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The law of 4 September 1938, which at the specific direction of
Hitler was not made public, was signed by Hitler and by Funk,
among others, as “Chief Plenipotentiary for Economics” (<span class='it'>2194-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Funk, in a speech which he delivered on 14 October 1939, explained
how he, as Chief Plenipotentiary for Economics, had,
for a year and a half prior to the launching of the aggression
against Poland, advanced Germany’s economic preparation for
war. He stated:
<span class='pageno' title='729' id='Page_729'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Although all the economic and financial departments were
harnessed in the tasks and work of the Four Year Plan
under the leadership of <span class='it'>Generalfeldmarschall</span> Goering, the
war economic preparation of Germany has also been advanced
in secret in another sector for well over a year,
namely, by means of the formation of a national guiding
apparatus for the special war economic tasks, which had to
be mastered at that moment, when the condition of war
became a fact. For this work as well all economic departments
were combined into one administrative authority,
namely under the General Plenipotentiary for Economy, to
which position the Fuehrer appointed me one and a half
years ago.” (<span class='it'>3324-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In his dual capacity of Chief Plenipotentiary for Economics
and Minister of Economics, Funk naturally was advised of the
requirements which the conspirators’ program of aggression
imposed on the economy. Thus, during a conference in the
Reich Aviation Ministry on 14 October 1938 under the chairmanship
of Goering, Goering referred to Hitler’s orders for an
abnormal increase of armament, particularly weapons for attack,
and directed the Ministry of Economics to submit suggestions
on how to finance this rearmament by increasing exports.
The report of Goering’s remarks states in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“General Field Marshal Goering opened the session by declaring
that he intended to give directives about the work
for the next months. Everybody knows from the press what
the world situation looks like and therefore the Fuehrer has
issued an order to him to carry out a gigantic program compared
to which previous achievements are insignificant.
There are difficulties in the way which he will overcome with
utmost energy and ruthlessness.</p>

<p>“The amount of foreign exchange has completely dwindled
on account of the preparation for the Czech Enterprise and
this makes it necessary that it should be strongly increased
immediately. Furthermore, the foreign credits have been
greatly overdrawn and thus the strongest export activity—stronger
than up to now—is in the foreground. For the
next weeks an increased export was first priority in order
to improve the foreign exchange situation. The Reich Ministry
for Economy should make a plan about raising the
export activity by pushing aside the current difficulties
which prevent export.</p>

<p>“These gains made through the export are to be used for
<span class='pageno' title='730' id='Page_730'></span>
increased armament. The armament should not be curtailed
by the export activity. He received the order from the
Fuehrer to increase the armament to an abnormal extent,
the air force having first priority. Within the shortest time
the air force is to be increased five fold, also the navy should
get armed more rapidly and the army should procure large
amounts of offensive weapons at a faster rate, particularly
heavy artillery pieces and heavy tanks. Along with
this manufactured armaments must go; especially fuel, powder
and explosives are moved into the foreground. It
should be coupled with the accelerated construction of highways,
canals, and particularly of the railroads.” (<span class='it'>1301-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Goering’s words were the words of one already at war. And the
emphasis on quintupling the Air Force and accelerating weapon
manufacture for attack, were the words of a man waging aggressive
war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Funk actively participated in the planning of wartime financial
measures (<span class='it'>1301-PS</span>). This was natural since Funk, after
1938, occupied three positions crucial to finance: Minister of Economics,
President of the Reichsbank (to which he was appointed
in January 1939), and Chief Plenipotentiary for Economics.
Funk’s role in war financing is illustrated by a letter, dated
1 June 1939, from the Chief Plenipotentiary for Economics
(Funk), signed on his behalf by Dr. Posse (<span class='it'>3562-PS</span>). This
letter found in the captured files of the Reich Ministry of Economics,
transmitted the minutes of a meeting concerning the
financing of the war. This meeting had been held under the
chairmanship of Dr. Landfried, Funk’s Undersecretary in the
Reich Ministry of Economics. The document bears a marginal
note in the bottom left hand corner, dated 5 June, stating that
the document was “to be shown to the Minister” [i.e., Funk].
Only eight copies were made of the Minutes, which were marked
“Top Secret”. Four of these copies were sent to officials directly
subordinate to Funk (two in the Reich Ministry of Economics,
one in the Reichsbank, and one in the Office of the Chief Plenipotentiary
for Economics). During the course of the meeting,
which was attended by twelve officials, five of whom were
directly responsible to Funk in his various capacities, the conferees
discussed a memorandum regarding war finance which
had been prepared by the Chief Plenipotentiary for Economics
on May 9, 1939. The minutes of this meeting state:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * Then a report was made of the contents of the
‘Notes on the Question of Internal Financing of War’, of
9 May of this year (appendix to GBW 8/2179/39 Top
<span class='pageno' title='731' id='Page_731'></span>
Secret), in which the figures given to me by the Reichs
Minister of Finance are also discussed. It was pointed out
that the General Plenipotentiary for the Economy is primarily
interested to introduce into the legislation for war
finance, the idea of financing war expenditures by anticipating
future revenues, to be expected after the war. * * *</p>

<p>“Undersecretary Newman, first, submitted for discussion the
question whether the production would be able to meet to
the assumed extent, the demands of the Army, especially
if the demands of the Army, as stated in the above report,
would increase to approximately 14 billions in the first three
months of war. He stated that, if the production potential
of the present Reich territory is taken as a basis, he doubts
the possibility of such a production increase.” (<span class='it'>3562-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p>During the course of the meeting one of the representatives of
the High Command stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The demands of the Army would probably be higher in the
first three months of war than during the further course of
the war.” (<span class='it'>3562-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the files of the Reich Ministry of Economics there was also
found, attached to the above letter and minutes, a Top Secret
memorandum entitled “Notes Concerning Financing of War.”
That memorandum reveals the plans to use the resources of
countries to be occupied in the interest of the Nazi war machine.
It states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * First, as concerns the scope of the total production,
it is clear that the economic power of the Protectorate
and of other territories, possibly to be acquired, must of
course be completely exhausted for the purposes of the conduct
of the war. It is, however, just as clear that these territories
cannot obtain any compensation from the economy of
Greater Germany for the products which they will have to
give us during the war, because their power must be used
fully for the war and for supplying the civilian home population.”
(<span class='it'>3562-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is plain that Funk exercised comprehensive authority over
large areas of the German economy whose proper organization
and direction were critical to effective war preparation. The once
powerful German military machine, which rested on the foundation
of thorough economic preparation, reflected the contribution
which Funk had made to Nazi aggression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately before this machine was directed against Poland,
the final preparatory steps were taken, and the previous appointment
<span class='pageno' title='732' id='Page_732'></span>
of Funk as Chief Plenipotentiary for Economics was made
public. Thus on 27 August 1939, Funk, in this capacity, issued
two decrees, one introducing general rationing of consumers’
goods, the other setting up regional economic authorities (<span class='it'>1939
Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, I, pp. 1495 and 1498).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, on 30 August 1939, Hitler, Goering, and Lammers
signed a decree establishing the Ministerial Council for Reich Defense,
composed of Goering, Funk, and Hess, among others, to
act as a War Cabinet (<span class='it'>1939 Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, I, p. 1532).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Funk mobilized the German economy for war with full knowledge
of the plans for military aggression. An irresistible inference
of such knowledge arises from the combination of several factors:
from Funk’s long and intimate association with the Nazi inner
circle; from the very nature of his official functions; from the
war-dominated setting of Nazi Germany; from the fact that
force and the threat of force had become the open and primary
instruments of Nazi policy; and finally from the fact that at the
same time that Funk was making economic preparations, specific
plans for aggression—later to be carried out—were being formulated,
plans which could only be effective if they were synchronized
with the complementary economic measures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The inference of Funk’s knowledge and intent is reinforced beyond
question by considering, in the light of the factors described
above, the more specific evidence of Funk’s knowledge of aggressive
plans. Thus, Funk, at the very beginnings of the Nazi Government,
had stated that the absorption of Austria by Germany
was a political and economic necessity, and that it would be
achieved by whatever means were necessary (<span class='it'>1760-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Goering had issued instructions to the Ministry of Economics—in
the language of a man waging aggressive war (<span class='it'>1301-PS</span>).
Moreover, Funk and his subordinates in May 1939 were making
detailed plans for financing the war, that is, a particular war,
the war against Poland (<span class='it'>3562-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In connection with Funk’s economic planning for aggression,
reference should be made to other evidence of the preparatory
work which Funk carried on prior to the aggression against Poland.
Shortly before the attack on Poland, in a letter to Hitler
dated 25 August 1939, Funk expressed his gratification for his
role in the “tremendous events” of these days, and his thanks for
Hitler’s approval of his economic war measures. He concluded by
giving Hitler his pledge in that hour (<span class='it'>699-PS</span>). The text of the
letter is as follows:

have succeeded, through the provisions made already during
the last month, to make the German Reichsbank internally
so strong and so safe against attack from without that even
the most serious disturbances of the international currency
and credit systems would be absolutely unable to affect us.</p>

<p>“In the meantime I have in a wholly inconspicuous manner
converted into gold all assets of the Reichsbank and of the
German economy abroad on which we could possibly lay
hands. With the proposals worked out by me regarding a
ruthless choking of any unessential consumption and any
public expenditure and project not necessary for war we will
be able to meet all financial and economic demands without
any serious reverberations.</p>

<p>“In my capacity as General Plenipotentiary for Economics,
appointed by you, my Fuehrer, I have regarded it as my duty
to give you this report and this pledge in this hour.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:4em;'>“Heil, my Fuehrer</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;'>“(signed) Walther Funk”. (<span class='it'>699-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Funk both personally and through duly designated representatives
also participated in the planning which preceded the aggression
against the USSR. Thus, in April 1941, Rosenberg,
after he had been appointed deputy for centralized treatment of
problems concerning the Eastern Territories, discussed with
Funk the economic problems which would be raised when the
plans for aggression in the East were carried out (<span class='it'>1039-PS</span>).
At that time Funk appointed Dr. Schlotterer as his deputy to
<span class='pageno' title='734' id='Page_734'></span>
work with Rosenberg in connection with the exploitation of the
Eastern Territories. Funk’s deputy met with Rosenberg almost
daily.</p>

<h3>E. <span class='it'>FUNK WAS A MEMBER OF WAR-PLANNING AGENCIES WHICH WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR POLICIES AND ACTS CONTRARY TO THE LAWS OF WAR.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>After the launching of the Nazi aggression against Poland,
Funk, in his capacities as Minister of Economics, President of
the Reichsbank, and Chief Plenipotentiary for Economics, and
as a member of the Central Planning Board (to which he was
appointed in September 1943), actively participated in the waging
of aggressive war on the economic front. Moreover, by virtue of
his membership in the Central Planning Board, which formulated
and directed the execution of the program for the enslavement,
exploitation, and degradation of millions of foreign workers,
Funk shares special responsibility for the Nazi Slave Labor Program.
(See Chapter X on the Slave Labor Program. This special
aspect of Funk’s responsibility was left for development by the
French prosecuting staff.)</p>

<h3>F. <span class='it'>CONCLUSION.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>It is clear that Funk was a central figure in the Nazi conspiracy
and that, as a member of the Nazi inner circle, he helped formulate,
was aware of, and promoted the realization of, the conspirators’
program. He knew, moreover, that this program envisaged
the use of terror and force within and if necessary outside
of Germany, and that it contemplated the use of criminal
means. Funk, by promoting the conspirators’ accession to power
and the realization of their program, signified his approval of
such crimes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The evidence has also established that, after the Nazi seizure
of power, Funk promoted the achievement of the conspirators’
program by virtue of his activities in the Ministry of Propaganda,
activities which fomented and carried out the persecution of Jews
and dissidents; which psychologically mobilized the German
people for aggressive war; and which reduced the willingness
and capacity of the conspirators’ intended victims to resist aggression.
Funk also participated, as Minister of Economics, in
the formulation and execution of the policy for the complete elimination
of the Jews from the German economy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Minister of Economics, President of the Reichsbank, and
<span class='pageno' title='735' id='Page_735'></span>
Chief Plenipotentiary for Economics, Funk mobilized the German
economy for aggressive war, with full knowledge of the conspirators’
plans for aggression. Moreover, in these capacities,
and as a member of the Ministerial Council for the Defense and
the Central Planning Board, he also actively participated in the
waging of aggressive wars. Finally, by virtue of his membership
in the Central Planning Board, which formulated and directed
the execution of the program for the enslavement, exploitation,
and degradation of millions of foreign workers, he bears a special
responsibility for the war crimes committed in the execution of
that program.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg738a'>12. HJALMAR SCHACHT</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The prosecution concedes, at the outset, that although Schacht
believed that the Jews of Germany should be stripped of their
rights as citizens, he was not in complete sympathy with that aspect
of the Nazi Party’s program which involved the wholesale
extermination of the Jews, and that he was, for that reason, attacked
from time to time by the more extreme elements of the
Nazi Party. It further concedes that Schacht, on occasion, gave
aid and comfort to individual Jews who sought to escape the
indignities generally inflicted upon Jews in Nazi Germany.
Schacht’s attitude towards the Jews is exemplified by his speech
<span class='pageno' title='739' id='Page_739'></span>
at the German Eastern Fair, Koenigsberg, on 18 August 1935,
wherein he said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Jew must realize that their influence is gone for all
times. We desire to keep our people and our culture pure
and distinctive, just as the Jews have always demanded this
of themselves since the time of the prophet Ezra. But the
solution of these problems must be brought about under state
leadership, and cannot be left to unregulated individual actions,
which mean a disturbing influence on the national</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The foregoing concessions should render it unnecessary for
Schacht to produce evidence upon these matters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prosecution’s case against Schacht is that he planned and
prepared for wars of aggression and wars in violation of international
treaties, agreements and assurances, and that he knowingly
and wilfully participated in the Nazi common plan or conspiracy
to plan, prepare, initiate, and wage such wars. The
evidence establishes that Schacht actively supported Hitler’s accession
to power; that he was the chief architect of the financial
plans and devices which made possible the huge program of rearmament
in Germany; that he played a dominant role in the
economic planning of, and preparation for, wars of aggression;
and that he contributed his efforts willingly and with full knowledge
of the fact that the leader of the conspiracy, Adolf Hitler,
was determined upon attaining his objectives by launching aggressive
wars.</p>

<span class='listTag'>(9)</span><p class='listPara'>Schacht was dismissed as President of the Reichsbank on
20 January 1939. In connection therewith, Hitler expressed
his deep gratitude for Schacht’s past services and his
gratification that Schacht would remain to serve him as
Minister Without Portfolio (<span class='it'>EC-397</span>).</p>
</div>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>(10)</span><p class='listPara'>Schacht remained as Minister Without Portfolio until
January 1943, when he was dismissed by Hitler. During
the period from the time of his dismissal as President of
the Reichsbank until the end of 1942, he continued to receive
the full salary he had been paid as the President of
the Reichsbank, and thereafter received a pension from
the Reichsbank. As Minister Without Portfolio, he received
a large salary from the Nazi Government and other
emoluments of the office (<span class='it'>3724-PS</span>).</p>

<h3>B. <span class='it'>PRIOR TO 1933, SCHACHT ACCEPTED THE NAZI PROGRAM AND HELPED HITLER TO POWER.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht met Goering for the first time in December 1930, and
Hitler early in January 1931, at Goering’s house. He thought
that Hitler was “full of will and spirit” and a man “with whom
one could cooperate”. Thereafter, he actively supported Hitler’s
accession to power (<span class='it'>3725-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3729-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht’s belief in the Nazi program and his undivided loyalty
to Hitler are revealed in his letter to Hitler dated 29 August 1932,
wherein he pledged continued support to Hitler after the latter’s
poor showing in the July 1932 elections and proferred advice concerning
electioneering tactics. The letter includes the following
statements, <span class='it'>inter alia</span>:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“But what you could perhaps do with in these days is a word
of most sincere sympathy. Your movement is carried internally
by so strong a truth and necessity that victory in one
form or another cannot elude you for long. * * *”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“Wherever my work may take me in the near future even if
you should see me one day within the fortress—you can always
count on me as your reliable assistant.” (<span class='it'>EC-457</span>).</p>

</div>

<p>Subsequently, on 12 November 1932, he again wrote to Hitler,
congratulating him upon his firm attitude and stating:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I have no doubt that the present development of things
<span class='pageno' title='741' id='Page_741'></span>
can only lead to your becoming chancellor. * * * I am
quite confident that the present system is certainly doomed to
disintegration.” (<span class='it'>EC-456</span>).</p>

</div>

<p>The fact that Schacht was in complete accord with Hitler’s program
is further shown by the following entry of 21 November
1932, in Goebbels’ diary:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“In a conversation with Dr. Schacht, I assured myself that
he absolutely represents our point of view. He is one of the
few who accepts the Fuehrer’s position entirely.” (<span class='it'>2409-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Schacht has himself confirmed the correctness of Goebbels’ statement
(<span class='it'>3729-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Schacht’s contribution to Hitler before his accession to
power did not consist merely of comforting him, giving advice,
and expressing agreement with the Nazi program. He was an
active participant in Hitler’s vigorous campaign to take over the
German state. Thus, he openly lent the prestige of his name,
which was widely known in banking, financial, and business circles,
to Hitler’s cause (<span class='it'>3729-PS</span>). He actively undertook to
induce business leaders to support Hitler. In his letter to Hitler
of 12 November 1932, he wrote that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It seems as if our attempt to collect a number of signatures
from business circles for this purpose (your becoming Chancellor)
was not altogether in vain * * *.” (<span class='it'>EC-456</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>He organized the financial means for the decisive March 1933
election, at a meeting of Hitler with a group of German industrialists
in Berlin. At this meeting, Hitler bluntly announced
his plans to destroy the parliamentary system in Germany, to
crush all internal opposition by force, to restore the power of
the Wehrmacht, and to gain his objectives outside of Germany
by the use of force. On this occasion, Schacht collected a campaign
fund of several million Marks for Hitler’s use (<span class='it'>D-203</span>;
<span class='it'>EC-439</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In an eulogy of Schacht on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday,
the <span class='it'>Voelkischer Beobachter</span>, Hitler’s official organ, aptly described
Schacht’s activity in the period before the 1933 election
as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“In this critical period, Schacht never failed to point at
Adolf Hitler as the only possible leader of the Reich.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The name of Dr. Schacht will remain linked with the transition
of the German economy to the new National Socialist
methods” (<span class='it'>EC-499</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='742' id='Page_742'></span></p>

<h3>C. <span class='it'>SCHACHT PLAYED A DOMINANT ROLE IN THE CONSPIRATORS’ PROGRAM OF REARMAMENT AND ECONOMIC PLANNING AND PREPARATION FOR WAR.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Germany was virtually prostrate in the early part of 1933;
she was faced with dwindling revenues from taxation and seemingly
unable to raise money either through external or internal
loans. Hitler entrusted to Schacht the task of wringing from the
depressed German economy the tremendous material requirements
of armed aggression, and endowed him with vast powers
over every sector of German industry, commerce, and finance to
carry out that task. Some of the devices which Schacht employed
to fulfill his mission will now be examined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht’s program, as hereinafter outlined, was, by his own
admissions, dedicated to the accomplishment of Hitler’s armament
program. In a memorandum to Hitler dated 3 May 1935
concerning the financing of armament, Schacht wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The following comments are based on the assumption that
the accomplishment of the armament program in regard to
speed and extent, is <span class='it'>the</span> task of German policy, and that
therefore everything else must be subordinated to this aim,
although the reaching of this main goal must not be imperiled
by neglecting other questions. * * *”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“* * * all expenditures which are not urgently needed
in other matters, must stop and the entire, in itself small,
financial power of Germany must be concentrated toward the
one goal: to arm.” (<span class='it'>1168-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In a letter to General Thomas dated 29 December 1937, Schacht
stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I have always considered a rearmament of the German
people as <span class='it'>conditio sine qua non</span> of the establishment of a new
German nation.” (<span class='it'>EC-257</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht’s vast achievements in furtherance of the conspirators’
program may conveniently be considered under four headings:
(a) armament financing; (b) the “New Plan”; (c) control of
production; and (d) plans and preparations for economic controls
during war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Armament Financing.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) <span class='it'>Mefo bills.</span> The financing of the conspirators’ huge rearmament
program presented a twofold problem to Schacht.
First, was the need of obtaining funds over and above the amount
which could be obtained through taxation and public loans. Second,
<span class='pageno' title='743' id='Page_743'></span>
was the conspirators’ desire, in the early stages of rearmament,
to conceal the extent of their feverish armament activities.
Schacht’s answer to the problem was the “mefo” bills, a scheme
which he devised for the exclusive use of armament financing
(<span class='it'>EC-436</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Transactions in “mefo” bills worked as follows: “mefo” bills
were drawn by armament contractors and accepted by a limited
liability company called the <span class='it'>Metallurgische Forschungsgesellschaft</span>,
m.b.H.(MEFO). This company was merely a dummy
organization; it had a nominal capital of only one million Reichsmarks.
“Mefo” bills ran for six months, but provision was
made for extensions running consecutively for three months each.
The drawer could present his “mefo” bills to any German bank
for discount at any time, and these banks, in turn, could rediscount
the bills at the Reichsbank at any time within the last
three months of their earliest maturity. The amount of “mefo”
bills outstanding was a guarded state secret (<span class='it'>EC-436</span>). The
“mefo” bill system continued to be used until 1 April 1938,
when 12 billion Reichsmarks of “mefo” bills were outstanding
(<span class='it'>EC-436</span>). This method of financing enabled the Reich to obtain
credit from the Reichsbank which, under existing statutes, it
could not directly have obtained. Direct lending to the Government
by the Reichsbank had been limited by statute to 100 million
Reichsmarks (<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, 1924, II, p. 241). Schacht has
conceded that his “mefo” bill device “enabled the Reichsbank
to lend by a subterfuge to the Government what it normally or
legally could not do” (<span class='it'>3728-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a speech delivered on 29 November 1938, Schacht glowingly
described the credit policy of the Reichsbank of which he was the
author as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is possible that no bank of issue in peacetimes carried
on such a daring credit policy at the Reichsbank since the
seizure of power by National Socialism. With the aid of
this credit policy, however, Germany created an armament
second to none, and this armament in turn made possible
the results of our policy.” (<span class='it'>EC-611</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The “daring credit policy,” which made possible the creation
of “an armament second to none,” obviously embraced the
“mefo” bill financing which he had contrived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) <span class='it'>Use of funds of opponents of Nazi regime.</span> In his efforts
to draw upon every possible source of funds for the conspirators’
rearmament program, Schacht even used the blocked funds of
foreigners’ deposits in the Reichsbank. In his memorandum to
Hitler of 3 May 1935, Schacht boasted:
<span class='pageno' title='744' id='Page_744'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reichsbank invested the major part of Reichsbank accounts
owned by foreigners, and which were accessible to the
Reichsbank, in armament drafts. Our armaments are, therefore,
being financed partially with the assets of our political
opponents.” (<span class='it'>1168-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) <span class='it'>Taxation and long term indebtedness.</span> “Mefo” bills and
the funds of political opponents of the conspirators were, of
course, not the only sources from which Schacht drew to finance
the armament program. Funds for rearmament were likewise
derived from taxation and an increase in public debt—channels
through which part of national income is ordinarily diverted to
public authorities. But what distinguished the conspirators’ program
of public indebtedness was the fact that the German capital
market was completely harnessed to the expanding needs of the
Nazi war machine. By a series of controls, they reduced to the
minimum consistent with their rearmament program, all private
issues which might have competed with Government issues for
the limited funds in the capital market. Thus, the capital market
was, in effect, pre-empted for Government issues (<span class='it'>EC-497</span>;
<span class='it'>EC-611</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the period from 31 December 1932 to 30 June 1938, the
funded debt of the Reich rose from 10.4 billion Marks to 19 billion
Marks (<span class='it'>EC-419</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>This large increase in funded debt was dedicated “as far as
possible” to “the financing of armament and the Four-Year Plan”
(<span class='it'>EC-611</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>The New Plan.</span> The conspirators’ grandiose armament
plans obviously required huge quantities of raw materials.
Schacht was a proponent of the view that as much of the requisite
raw materials as possible should be produced within Germany.
At the same time, however, he recognized that large imports of
raw materials were indispensable to the success of the conspirators’
gigantic armament program. To that end, he fashioned an
intricate system of controls and devices which he called the “New
Plan” (<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, 1934, I, pp. 816, 829, 864; <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>,
1935, I, p. 105).</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were three main features of the “New Plan” as devised
by Schacht: (1) restriction of the demand for such foreign exchange
as would be used for purposes unrelated to the conspirators’
rearmament program; (2) increase of the supply of foreign
exchange, as a means of paying for essential imports which could
not otherwise be acquired; and (3) clearing agreements and
other devices obviating the need for foreign exchange. Under the
<span class='pageno' title='745' id='Page_745'></span>
“New Plan”, economic transactions between Germany and the
outside world were no longer governed by the autonomous price
mechanism; they were determined by a number of Government
agencies whose primary aim was to satisfy the needs of the conspirators’
military economy (<span class='it'>EC-437</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht accomplished the negative task of restricting the demand
for foreign exchange</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“by various measures suspending the service on Germany’s
foreign indebtedness, by freezing other claims of foreigners
on Germany, by a stringent system of export controls and by
eliminating foreign travel and other unessential foreign expenditures.”
(<span class='it'>EC-437</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>In order to increase the available supply of foreign exchange</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Schacht repeatedly requisitioned all existing foreign exchange
reserves of German residents, required all foreign exchange
arising out of current exports and other transactions
to be sold to the Reichsbank, and by developing new export
markets. Exports were encouraged by direct subsidies and
by accepting partial payment in German foreign bonds or in
restricted Marks which could be acquired by foreign importers
at a substantial discount.” (<span class='it'>EC-437</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A vast network of organizations was erected to effectuate these
various measures. Suffice it for the present purposes to mention
merely one of these organizations: the supervisory agencies
(<span class='it'>Ueberwachungsstellen</span>). These agencies, which were under
Schacht’s control as Minister of Economics, decided whether
given imports and exports were desirable; whether the quantities,
prices, credit terms, and countries involved were satisfactory;
and, in short, whether any particular transaction advanced the
conspirators’ armament program. The overriding military purpose
of the series of controls instituted under the “New Plan” is
plainly shown in Schacht’s letter of 5 August 1937 to Goering,
wherein he said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * The very necessity of bringing our armament up
to a certain level as rapidly as possible must place in the foreground
the idea of as large returns as possible in foreign exchange
and therewith the greatest possible assurance of raw
material supplies, through exporting.” (<span class='it'>EC-497</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>There remains for consideration that aspect of the “New Plan”
which involved extensive use of clearing agreements and other
arrangements made by Schacht to obtain materials from abroad
without the expenditure of foreign exchange. The principle of
the clearing system is as follows: The importer makes a deposit
<span class='pageno' title='746' id='Page_746'></span>
of the purchase price in his own currency at the national clearing
agency of his country, which places the same amount to the credit
of the clearing agency of the exporting country. The latter
institution then pays the exporter in his own currency. Thus, if
trade between two countries is unequal, the clearing agency of one
acquires a claim against the agency of the other. That claim, however,
is satisfied only when a shift in the balance of trade gives
rise to an offsetting claim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This device was used by Schacht as a means of exploiting Germany’s
position as Europe’s largest consumer in order to acquire
essential raw materials from countries which, because of the
world wide economic depression, were dependent upon the German
market as an outlet for their surplus products. Speaking of
his system of obtaining materials abroad without the use of
foreign exchange, Schacht has stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It has been shown that, in contrast to everything which
classical national economy has hitherto taught, not the producer
but the consumer is the ruling factor in economic life.
And this thesis is somewhat connected with general social
and political observations, because it establishes the fact that
the number of consumers is considerably larger than the number
of producers, a fact which exercises a not inconsiderable
social and political pressure.” (<span class='it'>EC-611</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht’s clearing agreements were particularly effective in
Southeastern Europe, where agricultural exports had been considerably
curtailed by competition from the more extensive and
efficient overseas agriculture. The success of Schacht’s ruthless
use of Germany’s bargaining position is indicated by the fact that
by August 1937, there had been imported into Germany approximately
one half billion Reichsmarks of goods in excess of the
amount delivered under the clearing arrangements. In his letter
to Goering dated 5 August 1937, Schacht stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * in clearing transactions with countries furnishing
raw materials and food products we have bought in excess of
the goods we were able to deliver to these countries (namely,
Southeastern Europe and Turkey) roughly one half billion
RM * * *.” (<span class='it'>EC-497</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, through this device, Schacht was able to extract huge
loans from foreign countries which Germany could not have obtained
through ordinary channels. The device as developed by
Schacht was subsequently used during the war as a means of
systematically exploiting the occupied countries of Western
Europe.
<span class='pageno' title='747' id='Page_747'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to the clearing agreements, Schacht devised the
system which came to be known as the “aski” accounts. This
scheme likewise obviated the need for free currency (i.e. Reichsmarks
freely convertible into foreign currency at the official
rate—U. S. dollars, pounds sterling, etc). The system worked as
follows: The German foreign exchange control administration
would authorize imports of goods in specified quantities and categories
on the condition that the foreign sellers agreed to accept
payment in the form of Mark credits to accounts of a special type
held in German banks. These accounts were called “aski”, an
abbreviation of <span class='it'>Auslander Sonderkonten fuer Inlandszahlungen</span>
(foreigners’ special accounts for inland payments). The so-called
“aski” Marks in such an account could be used to purchase German
goods only for export to the country of the holder of the
account; they could not be converted into foreign currency at the
official rates of exchange. Each group of “aski” accounts formed
a separate “island of exchange” in which the German authorities,
under Schacht’s leadership, could apply their control as the country’s
bargaining position in each case seemed to warrant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht’s ingenious devices were eminently successful. They
admirably served the conspirators’ need of obtaining materials
which were necessary to create and maintain their war machine.
On this point, Schacht has stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The success of the New Plan can be proved by means of a
few figures. Calculated according to quantity, the import of
finished products was throttled by 63 percent between 1934
and 1937. On the other hand, the import of ores was increased
by 132 percent, of petroleum by 116, of grain by
102 and of rubber by 71 percent.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“These figures show how much the New Plan contributed to
the execution of the armament program as well as to the securing
of our food.” (<span class='it'>EC-611</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Production Control.</span> As an additional means of assuring
that the conspirators’ military needs would be met, Schacht
adopted a host of controls over the productive mechanism of Germany,
extending, <span class='it'>inter alia</span>, to the allocation of raw materials,
regulation of productive capacity, use of abundant or synthetic
substitutes in place of declining stocks of urgently needed materials,
and the erection of new capacity for the production of
essential commodities. The structure of regulation was built up
out of thousands of decrees in which governmental agencies under
<span class='pageno' title='748' id='Page_748'></span>
Schacht’s control issued permits, prohibitions, and instructions.
These decrees were the outgrowth of carefully laid plans of the
Ministry of Economics, of which Schacht was the head, concerning
“economic preparation for the conduct of war”, and in accordance
with its view that “genuine positive economic mobilization”
demanded that “exact instructions for every individual
commercial undertaking are laid down by a central authority”
(<span class='it'>EC-128</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The plan to allocate raw materials was carried out through
myriad “orders to produce” specifying that certain commodities
must or must not be produced; “orders to process or use” prescribing
the type and quantity of raw material which could or
could not be used in the production of a given commodity; orders
specifying that scarce raw materials could be used only as admixtures
with more plentiful but inferior products; and other
like measures. The precise details of these orders are unimportant
for present purposes. Their significance lies in the fact that
they were governed by a central purpose: preparation for war.
In the above mentioned secret report issued in September 1934
by the Ministry of Economics it was said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Rules are to be initiated for the allotment of scarce raw materials
etc.; and their use and processing for other than war,
or otherwise absolutely vital, goods is prohibited.” (<span class='it'>EC-128</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The military aspects of Schacht’s plans to increase the production
of scarce raw materials within Germany, and thereby reduce
Germany’s dependence upon foreign countries for materials
needed in the rearmament program, are likewise revealed in the
aforementioned report of the Ministry of Economics of September
1934:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The investigations initiated by the Raw Materials Commission
and the measures introduced for enlarging our raw
materials basis through home production as well as for furthering
the production of substitute materials will directly
benefit war economy preparations.” (<span class='it'>EC-128</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>Plans and Preparations for Economic Controls During
War.</span> Pursuant to the unpublished Reich Defense Law secretly
enacted on 21 May 1935, Schacht was appointed General Plenipotentiary
for War Economy by Hitler. Under this law, Schacht
was placed in complete charge of economic planning and preparation
for war in peacetime, except for the direct production of armaments
which was entrusted to the Ministry of War; and upon
the outbreak of war, Schacht was to be the virtual economic dictator
of Germany. His task was “to put all economic forces in
<span class='pageno' title='749' id='Page_749'></span>
the service of carrying on the war and to secure the life of the
German people economically”. In order to facilitate his task,
the Ministers of Economy, Food and Agriculture, Labor, and Forestry
were subordinated to him, and he was authorized “within
his realm of responsibility, to issue legal regulations which may
deviate from existing regulations”. The necessity for absolute
secrecy was stressed (<span class='it'>2261-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht appointed Wohlthat as his deputy General Plenipotentiary
for War Economy and organized a staff to carry out his
directives. Schacht has admitted that he must accept full responsibility
for the actions of these subordinates (<span class='it'>3729-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before his resignation in late 1937, Schacht had worked out in
amazing detail his plans and preparations for the German economy
in the forthcoming war. Recognizing that wartime controls,
to be effective, must be based on adequate information, Schacht
had directed the completion of comprehensive surveys of 180,000
industrial plants in Germany and had compiled statistics concerning</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * the composition of the labor force as to sex, age,
and training, the consumption of raw and auxiliary material,
fuels, power, the productive capacity, the domestic and foreign
trade as well as the supply of material and products in
the beginning and at the end of the year.” (<span class='it'>EC-258</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>On the basis of the statistical data thus collected, plans had been
formulated by the end of 1937 wherein</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * the needs of the Armed Forces and the civilian
minimum needs in wartime are compared with the covering
thereof by supplies and production.” (<span class='it'>EC-258</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The supervisory boards, which were briefly described above in
connection with the import and export controls, were charged
with “preparing their orders for the regulation of war contracts
and fees”, and were instructed to coordinate with various Reich
manpower authorities to secure “their indispensable personnel”
(<span class='it'>EC-258</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Special measures were taken under Schacht’s direction, to maintain
“mobilization stocks” of coal and to assure their distribution
in accordance with the wartime needs of armament factories and
large consumers. Large “gasoline storage places” were constructed
for use of the Wehrmacht and “gasoline stations and gasoline
stores” were designated “for the first equipment of the troops in
case of mobilization”. Careful plans were also made for the allocation
of power during war, and practice manoeuvers were held
<span class='pageno' title='750' id='Page_750'></span>
in order to determine “what measures have to be taken in case
places of power generation should be eliminated” (<span class='it'>EC-258</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evacuation plans for the removal of war materials, agricultural
products, skilled workers, and animals from military zones were
worked out by the Office of the Plenipotentiary for War Economy
with characteristic thoroughness. Thus, “the supplies and skilled
workers in the evacuation zones” were “registered, earmarked
for transportation into certain salvage areas and registered with
the <span class='it'>Wehrkreiskommandos</span> by the field offices of evacuation and
salvaging plans” (<span class='it'>EC-258</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Detailed plans for a system of rationing to become effective immediately
upon mobilization had already been made by the end
of 1937:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The 80 million ration cards necessary for this purpose have
already been printed and deposited with the Landrats, Chief
Mayors, and corresponding authorities. The further distribution
of the ration cards to the individual households is prepared
by these authorities to take place within 24 hours after
mobilization has been ordered.” (<span class='it'>EC-258</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Trusted persons whose reliability had been attested to by the
Secret State Police were installed in important enterprises and
charged with the execution of “measures which guarantee the
maintenance of production of their enterprises in the event of
mobilization”. Their functions likewise extended, among other
matters, to applying “for exemptions from military service” of
“employees who are indispensable to their enterprise”, and seeking
immunity from requisition by the Wehrmacht of all motor
trucks which were needed in the enterprises to which they were
assigned (<span class='it'>EC-258</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pursuant to directives issued by Schacht as Plenipotentiary,
labor authorities of the Government ascertained “the available
amount of manpower, the wartime requirements of manpower
and measures for the covering of the wartime needs”. The wartime
needs were to be met in part “by using reserve manpower
(manpower theretofore used in non-essential enterprises, women,
etc.)”, and by making “every change of working place and every
hiring of workers dependent upon the consent of the Labor Office”
(<span class='it'>EC-258</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The foregoing measures, it should be noted, are merely representative;
they are not exhaustive. But enough appears to make
it abundantly clear that Schacht’s contribution, by any standard
was an extraordinarily important one. Enough appears, moreover,
to give particular emphasis to the following observations of
<span class='pageno' title='751' id='Page_751'></span>
the Honorable George S. Messersmith, United States Consul General
in Berlin from 1930 to 1934:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“It was his [Schacht’s] financial ability that enabled the
Nazi regime in the early days to find the financial basis for
the tremendous armament program and which made it possible
to carry it through. If it had not been for his efforts, and
this is not a personal observation of mine only but I believe
was shared and is shared by every observer at the time, the
Nazi regime would have been unable to maintain itself in
power and to establish its control over Germany, much less
to create the enormous war machine which was necessary for
its objectives in Europe and later throughout the world.</p>

<p>“The increased industrial activity in Germany incident to rearmament
made great imports of raw materials necessary
while at the same time exports were decreasing. Yet by
Schacht’s resourcefulness, his complete financial ruthlessness,
and his absolute cynicism, Schacht was able to maintain and
to establish the situation for the Nazis. Unquestionably without
this complete lending of his capacities to the Nazi Government
and all of its ambitions, it would have been impossible
for Hitler and the Nazis to develop an Armed Force
sufficient to permit Germany to launch an aggressive war.”
(<span class='it'>EC-451</span>).</p>

</div>

<h3>D. <span class='it'>SCHACHT PARTICIPATED IN THE NAZI CONSPIRACY PURPOSELY, WILLINGLY, AND WITH KNOWLEDGE OF ITS ILLEGAL AIMS AND METHODS.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>He was a faithful adherent of Hitler.</span> It has already been
demonstrated that even before Hitler’s accession to power,
Schacht aligned himself with Hitler and accepted his program.
Schacht’s utterances after Hitler had entrenched himself in power
clearly show that he remained a faithful servant of Hitler despite
the series of outrages committed under Hitler’s direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the opening of the Leipzig Fair on 4 March 1935, Schacht
said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“My so-called foreign friends don’t render any services to
me or the cause, which they don’t want anyway, of course,
but not even to themselves, if they try to construe a contrast
between me and the allegedly impossible economic theories
of National Socialism and represent me as a sort of
guardian of economic reason. I assure you that all that I am
doing and saying enjoys the absolute approval of the Fuehrer
and that I would never do or say anything that does not have
<span class='pageno' title='752' id='Page_752'></span>
his approval. Not I but the Fuehrer is the guardian of economic
reason.” (<span class='it'>EC-503</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On the occasion of the unveiling of Hitler’s bust in the vestibule
of the Reichsbank on 31 July 1935, Schacht said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Germany stays and falls with the success of the policy of
Hitler.” (<span class='it'>EC-415</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At a ceremony in connection with the creation of the Economic
Chamber for Pomerania in Stettin on 19 January 1936, Schacht
denied that there was any disagreement between Hitler and his
collaborators, and went on to say:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In Germany there is fortunately only one policy and one
economic policy, namely that of Adolf Hitler; to work with
him and for his goals is the highest satisfaction for every
member of the people’s community.” (<span class='it'>EC-502</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In May 1936, Schacht was attacked by some of the more radical
elements of the Nazi Party because he had rejected their “partially
irrational ideas” concerning armament financing. In repelling
these attacks, Schacht emphasized at a secret meeting
of the Ministers on 12 May 1936, that his program of financing
armaments had meant “the commitment of the last reserve from
the very beginning”; and he announced that despite the attacks,
he would continue to work because he</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * stands with unswerving loyalty to the Fuehrer,
because he fully recognizes the basic idea of National Socialism
and because at the end, the disturbances, compared to
the great task, can be considered irrelevant.” (<span class='it'>1301-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>So far as appears, Schacht did not become a member of the
Nazi Party until January 1937. Franz Reuter, whose biography
of Schacht was officially published in Germany in 1937, has
stated that Schacht’s becoming a regular Party member was
only a question of secondary importance, and even part of a carefully
planned policy, for,</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“By not doing so—at least until the final assertion, and victory
of the Party—he [Schacht] was able to assist it [the
Party] much better than he would have been able to do had
he become an official Party member.” (<span class='it'>EC-460</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 30 January 1937, Hitler bestowed the Golden Party Badge
upon Schacht, in recognition of his “special services to Party and
State.” Schacht accepted this hallmark of approval by the
Fuehrer with effusive thanks and a pledge of continued support.
In his speech of acceptance, Schacht stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The presentation of the Golden Badge of the Movement is
the highest honor the Third Reich has to offer. In honoring
me as the head of the Reichsbank and the Reich and
<span class='pageno' title='753' id='Page_753'></span>
Prussian Ministry of Economics, it honors at the same time
the two agencies which I am directing as well as the work of
all those officials, employees and workers functioning in these
two agencies.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“I thank all my colleagues among the ranks of officials,
employees, and workers for their faithfulness in the performance
of their work, and appeal to all of them further
to devote, with all their hearts, their entire strength to the
Fuehrer and the Reich. The German future lies in the
hands of our Fuehrer.” (<span class='it'>EC-500</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The depths of adulation were reached in a speech which
Schacht delivered on the occasion of Hitler’s 48th birthday in
April 1937. Schacht spoke as one of Hitler’s “closest collaborators,”
who had seen at first hand the difficulties which beset
the Fuehrer in the relentless march toward his goals. In his
speech, Schacht stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“With the limitless passion of a burning heart and the infallible
instinct of the born statesman, Adolf Hitler has won
for himself the soul of the German people in a battle fought
for 14 years with unswerving consequence.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“Only the closest collaborators of the Fuehrer know how difficult
is the burden of this responsibility; how sorrowful are
the hours during which decisions must be made which bear
upon the well being and the fate of all of Germany.” (EC-501)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In November 1938, at a time Schacht now asserts he was
plotting against Hitler, he stated in a speech:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Instead of a weak and vacillating Government, a single,
purposeful, energetic personality is ruling today. That is
the great miracle which has actually happened in Germany
and which has had its effects in all fields of life and not
least in that of economy and finance. There is no German
financial miracle. There is only the miracle of the reawakening
of German national consciousness and German discipline,
and we owe this miracle to our Fuehrer Adolf Hitler.”
(<span class='it'>EC-611</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Schacht favored the acquisition of additional territory
for Germany—peacefully if possible, but by aggressive war, if
necessary.</span> Schacht had long been a German nationalist and
<span class='pageno' title='754' id='Page_754'></span>
expansionist. As early as 1927, he spoke against the Versailles
Treaty:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Versailles Dictate cannot be an eternal document, because
not only its economic, but also its spiritual and moral
premises are wrong.” (<span class='it'>EC-415</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>He strongly favored the acquisition by Germany of both
colonial territory and contiguous territory in Europe. At the
Paris conference on 16 April 1929, he said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Germany can generally only pay if the Corridor and Upper
Silesia will be handed back to Germany from Polish possession,
and if besides somewhere on the earth colonial territory
will be made available to Germany.” (<span class='it'>3726-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In a speech in Danzig in June 1935, Schacht ascribed the economic
difficulties which confronted Danzig to “historical errors
of the greatest extent which were beyond the control of the German
people”. He sought to comfort his listeners with the assurance
that</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“We Germans in the Reich today are looking with fullest
confidence upon our comrades in the Danzig Free State, and
maintain our people’s fellowship with the interests, wishes
and hopes of this territory which has unfortunately been
separated from us.” (<span class='it'>EC-498</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In January 1936, Schacht again publicly spoke against the
Versailles Treaty, and impliedly threatened war unless its terms
were revised in Germany’s favor. At that time, he stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“But the memory of war weighs undiminished upon the
people’s minds. That is because deeper than material
wounds, moral wounds are smarting, inflicted by the so-called
peace treaties. Material loss can be made up through
renewed labor, but the moral wrong which has been inflicted
upon the conquered peoples, in the peace dictates, leaves a
burning scar on the people’s conscience. The spirit of the
Versailles has perpetuated the fury of war, and there will
not be a true peace, progress or reconstruction until the
world desists from this spirit. The German people will not
tire of pronouncing this warning.” (<span class='it'>EC-415</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Later in the same year, Schacht again publicly advocated
“<span class='it'>Lebensraum</span>” for the German people in terms not unlike those
employed by Hitler. In his speech at Frankfurt on 9 December
1936, Schacht said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Germany has too little living space for her population.
She has made every effort, and certainly greater efforts than
any other nation, to extract from her own existing small
space, whatever is necessary for the securing of her livelihood.
<span class='pageno' title='755' id='Page_755'></span>
However, in spite of all these efforts the space does
not suffice.” (<span class='it'>EC-415</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht had hoped, it is believed, that his desire for additional
space for Germany would be realized without resort to
war. In Austria, for example, he had authorized 200,000 Marks
a month to be set aside for the National Socialists in Austria,
hoping thereby to facilitate the absorption of Austria into Germany
without war. But if Germany’s neighbors would not accede
to the conspirators’ demands for additional space, Schacht was
willing to go to war to fulfill those demands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, on 23 September 1935, Schacht told S. R. Fuller, Jr. at
the American Embassy in Berlin:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Colonies are necessary to Germany. We shall get them
through negotiation if possible; but if not, we shall take
them.” (<span class='it'>EC-450</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In January 1937, Schacht, in a conversation with Ambassador
Davies, impliedly threatened a breach of the peace unless Germany’s
demands for colonies were met. The conversation is related
as follows in a report under date of 20 January 1937, by
Ambassador Davies to the Secretary of State:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“He [Schacht] stated the following: that the present condition
of the Germany people was intolerable, desperate and
unendurable; that he had been authorized by his Government
to submit proposals to France and England which
would (1) guarantee European peace; (2) secure present
European international boundaries; (3) reduce armaments;
(4) establish a new form of a workable League of Nations;
(5) abolish sanctions with new machinery for joint administration;
all based upon a colonial cession that would provide
for Germany an outlet for population, source for food
stuffs, fats and raw material. * * *” (<span class='it'>L-111</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The inference was clear: without a colonial cession, peace could
not be guaranteed. Equally clear was the inference that it would
be Germany in its search for “<span class='it'>Lebensraum</span>” that would disturb
the peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 21 December 1937, Schacht indicated to Ambassador Dodd
that he desired the annexation of neighboring countries, without
war if possible, but with war, if necessary. The pertinent portion
of Ambassador Dodd’s notes on this conversation are as
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Schacht meant what the Army chiefs of 1914 meant when
they invaded Belgium, expecting to conquer France in six
weeks; i.e., domination and annexation of neighboring little
countries, especially north and east. Much as he dislikes
<span class='pageno' title='756' id='Page_756'></span>
Hitler’s dictatorship, he, as most other eminent Germans,
wishes annexation—without war if possible, with war, if
the United States will keep hands off.” (<span class='it'>EC-461</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Schacht knew of Hitler’s plans to wage aggressive war and
wilfully provided the means whereby such a war might successfully
be waged.</span> Whether or not Schacht personally favored war,
it is clear that he at least knew that Hitler planned military aggression
and that he was providing Hitler with the instrument
by which those plans could be executed. Even before Hitler’s
accession to power, Schacht knew from a reading of <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>
that Hitler was bent upon expansion to the East by force of
arms (<span class='it'>3727-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of his frequent contacts with Mr. Messersmith,
United States Consul General in Berlin from 1930 to 1934,
Schacht emphasized that the “Nazis were inevitably going to
plunge Europe into war” (<span class='it'>EC-451</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In September of 1934, Ambassador Dodd recorded in his diary
a conversation with Sir Eric Phipps at the British Embassy in
Berlin, wherein he stated that “Schacht had acknowledged to me
the war purposes of the Nazi Party” (<span class='it'>EC-461</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht has admitted that in the course of his numerous talks
with Hitler from 1933 to 1937, he formed the impression that
“in order to make his hold on the Government secure, the Fuehrer
felt that he must present the German people with a military
victory” (<span class='it'>EC-458</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>These admissions by Schacht are fortified by other evidence
which shows that Schacht knew that Hitler planned military aggression.
After his appointment as Minister of Economics,
Schacht became a permanent member of the secret Reich Defense
Council. The function of that Council, as shown in other
connections, was secretly to mobilize all of the human and material
resources of Germany for war (<span class='it'>EC-177</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shortly after his appointment as the Plenipotentiary General
for the War Economy in May 1935, Schacht was entrusted by the
Reich Defense Council with the “preparation of economic mobilization”
in connection with the proposed re-occupation of the
Rhineland. Schacht and those officials who were charged with
the purely military aspects of the re-occupation were enjoined
to proceed with the utmost secrecy because of assurances given
by Hitler to the French that no military action was contemplated
in the de-militarized zone of the Rhineland (<span class='it'>EC-405</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the 11th meeting of the Reich Defense Council, on 6 December
1935, which was attended by a number of representatives
<span class='pageno' title='757' id='Page_757'></span>
from Schacht’s office of Plenipotentiary of the War Economy,
Keitel pointed out that</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“According to the will of the Fuehrer, the economic leadership
puts the increase of our armed might knowingly ahead
of other requirements of the state. It is the task of all members
of the Reich Defense Council to utilize the national
property, made available, primarily for this purpose and
economically in the framework of the entire situation, and
request only such funds and raw materials which serve absolutely
and exclusively the Reich Defense. * * *”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The singleness of purpose with which Schacht and the other
conspirators were gearing the German economy for war is strikingly
shown by the Top Secret minutes of the meeting of ministers
dated 30 May 1936. This, it will be recalled, was little more
than 10 weeks after German troops had occupied the Rhineland.
At this meeting, Schacht pointed out that “it must be attempted
to produce those raw materials within Germany which are economically
favorable; for other raw materials ready reserves for
the case of mobilization”; and also that “certain raw materials
for war must be stocked.” Continuing the discussion, Goering
emphasized that “all measures are to be considered from the
standpoint of an assured waging of war.” Thereafter, Schacht
advocated the introduction of price supervision and agreed that
first priority should be given to the “specially urgent petroleum
question” (<span class='it'>1301-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>By Top Secret letter dated 31 August 1936, Schacht was advised
by General von Blomberg that Hitler had ordered that “the
setting up of all air force units has to be completed on 1 April
1937”. This accelerated program entailed the expenditure of
large additional funds which Schacht and the Minister of Finance
were called upon to supply. The sense of urgency with which
Hitler pressed the completion of the German air force patently
signified that the waging of war was a certainty (<span class='it'>1301-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shortly after the receipt of this letter, and on 4 September
1936, Schacht attended a secret cabinet meeting where Goering
stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Fuehrer and Reichskanzler has given a memorandum
to the Col. General and the Reich War Minister which represents
a general instruction for the execution thereof.</p>

<p>“It starts from the basic thought that the showdown with
Russia is inevitable.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p><span class='pageno' title='758' id='Page_758'></span></p>

<p>“The Colonel General reads the memorandum of the
Fuehrer.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“If war should break out tomorrow we would be forced to
take measures from which we might possibly still shy away
at the present moment. They are, therefore, to be taken.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“All measures have to be taken just as if we were actually
in the stage of imminent danger of war.” (<span class='it'>EC-416</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>There was no room for surmise in these utterances; Hitler was
definitely and irrevocably committed to waging aggressive war.
If Schacht ever had any doubts concerning Hitler’s firm resolve
to carry out the program of aggressive war outlined in <span class='it'>Mein
Kampf</span>; if, contrary to his statements to Mr. Messersmith and
Ambassador Dodd, Schacht actually doubted in 1934 that the
Nazis, whom he was faithfully serving, would inevitably plunge
Europe into war; and if, despite the pressing sense of immediacy
that had pervaded the Nazi war economy from the very
outset, he had entertained lingering doubts concerning Hitler’s
plans for armed aggression, all such doubts must have been removed
by the clear and unequivocal pronouncements in the above-mentioned
eventful meetings of 1936 in which he participated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, despite his knowledge of Hitler’s plans to wage aggressive
war, despite the fact that he had grave technical doubts
about the ability of the Reichsbank to finance further armaments
through additional short term credits, and despite the fact that
some directors of the Reichsbank had opposed further “mefo”
financing, Schacht pledged another 3 billion Reichsmarks by the
“mefo” bill method for further financing of armaments in March
1937 (<span class='it'>EC-438</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Hossbach notes, dated 10 November 1937, on the important
conference of 5 November 1937 in the <span class='it'>Reichskanzlei</span>,
reveal a further crystallization of Hitler’s program of absorption
and conquest in Europe (<span class='it'>386-PS</span>). Definite plans were laid for
the early acquisition of Austria and Czechoslovakia, and for their
exploitation in preparation for further military operations. So
far as appears, Schacht was not present at this particular meeting.
But his awareness of what occurred at the meeting is shown
by the fact that he told Ambassador Bullitt on 23 November
1937, that</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Hitler was determined to have Austria eventually attached
to Germany and to obtain at least autonomy for the Germans
of Bohemia. At the present moment he was not vitally concerned
<span class='pageno' title='759' id='Page_759'></span>
about the Polish Corridor, and in his [Schacht’s]
opinion it might be possible to maintain the Corridor provided
Danzig were permitted to join East Prussia, and provided
some sort of a bridge could be built across the Corridor
uniting Danzig and East Prussia with Germany.”
(<span class='it'>L-151</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Although Schacht apparently sought to convey the impression
to Ambassador Bullitt that he desired to stay Hitler’s hand but
was powerless to do so, it is clear that he was actually in complete
sympathy with Hitler’s objectives. Despite the mounting tension
which followed his conversation with Ambassador Bullitt, Schacht
remained as President of the Reichsbank, and in that capacity
established, in advance of the invasion of Austria, the rate of exchange
between Marks and Austrian Schillings which was to prevail
after the absorption of Austria (<span class='it'>EC-421</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, under his direction, the Austrian National Bank was
merged into the Reichsbank (<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, 1938, I, 254).
His speech of 21 March 1938, to the employees of the former
Austrian National Bank on the occasion of its obliteration as an
independent institution, betrayed his true feelings. After inveighing
against “the dictates of Versailles and St. Germain”,
Schacht stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Thank God, these things could after all not hinder the great
German people on their way, for Adolf Hitler has created a
communion of German will and German thought, he bolstered
it up with the newly strengthened Wehrmacht and he then
finally gave the external form to the inner union between
Germany and Austria.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“One person says he would have done it maybe in one way,
but the remarkable thing is that they did not do it (hilarity),
that IT WAS ONLY DONE BY OUR ADOLF HITLER (Long
continued applause) and if there is still something left to be
improved, then those grumblers should try to bring about
those improvements from the German Reich and within the
German community, but not to disturb it from without.
(Lively agreement)”.</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“I ask you to raise your hands and to repeat after me:</p>

<p>I swear that: I will be faithful, and obedient to the Fuehrer
of the German Reich and the German people, Adolf Hitler,
and will perform my duties conscientiously and selflessly.
(The audience takes the pledge with uplifted hands).
<span class='pageno' title='760' id='Page_760'></span></p>

<p>You have taken this pledge. A scoundrel he who breaks it.
To our Fuehrer a triple ‘Sieg heil’.” (<span class='it'>EC-297-A</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht was likewise enthusiastic about the acquisition of the
Sudetenland, and filled with pride over the contribution his credit
policy as head of the Reichsbank had made thereto (<span class='it'>EC-611</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In January 1939, when Hitler was ruthlessly exploiting his successes
in Austria and the Sudetenland in preparation for his next
aggressive move, Schacht again referred, with pride, to the fact
that the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> which he had helped create by his ingenious
and risky methods had made possible Hitler’s successes. Thus, he
said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“From the beginning the Reichsbank has been aware of the
fact that a successful foreign policy can be attained only by
the reconstruction of the German armed forces. It [the
Reichsbank] therefore assumed to a very great extent the
responsibility to <span class='it'>finance</span> the rearmament in spite of the inherent
dangers to the currency. The justification thereof
was the necessity—which pushed all other considerations
into the background—to carry through the armament at once,
out of nothing and furthermore under camouflage, which
made a respect-commanding foreign policy possible.” (<span class='it'>EC-369</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The foregoing proof establishes, it seems clear, that Schacht
knew of Hitler’s plans for aggressive war, and wilfully created the
means whereby those plans could be executed. But apart from
this direct proof, it is submitted that to a man in Schacht’s position,
the events of the period clearly bespoke Hitler’s intentions.
Schacht was a key figure in the Nazi Government during the period
of the Nazi agitation in Austria, the introduction of conscription,
the march into the Rhineland, the conquest of Austria, and
the acquisition of the Sudetenland by a show of force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During this period, the Reich debt trebled under the stress of
mounting armaments (<span class='it'>EC-419</span>), and all the resources of Germany
were being strained to the very limit for armament. It was
a period in which the burning European foreign policy issue was
the satisfaction of Germany’s repeated demands for additional
territory. Hitler, committed to a policy of expansion, was laying
the greatest stress upon utmost speed in preparation for war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Certainly in this setting, Schacht did not proceed in ignorance
of the fact that he was assisting Hitler and Nazi Germany along
the road towards armed aggression.
<span class='pageno' title='761' id='Page_761'></span></p>

<h3>E. <span class='it'>SCHACHT’S LOSS OF POWER DID NOT IMPLY DISAGREEMENT WITH THE CONSPIRATORS’ PROGRAM OF AGGRESSIVE WAR.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>His resignation as Minister of Economics and General
Plenipotentiary for War Economy.</span> In November 1937, Schacht
resigned his offices as Minister of Economics and General Plenipotentiary
for War Economy. At the same time, he accepted appointment
as Minister without Portfolio, and continued as President
of the Reichsbank. It is submitted that the evidence shows
that Schacht’s resignations were merely the outgrowth of a clash
between two power-seeking individuals, Goering and Schacht, over
<span class='it'>methods</span> of creating a war economy and over who should have
final authority to direct the completion of the task. So far as appears,
Schacht was in full accord with the other conspirators upon
the <span class='it'>desirability</span> of providing Hitler with the means by which he
eventually could carry out his planned aggressions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The basic differences between Schacht and Goering date from
a period shortly after Goering became head of the Four-Year Plan
Office. The latter office was created by Hitler in September 1936,
and in connection therewith, Goering was “given far reaching
powers to issue directives to all the highest offices of the State
and Party”. Goering conceived of his function as head of the
Four-Year Plan Office “within four years to put the entire economy
in a state of readiness for war” (<span class='it'>EC-408</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht was in agreement with the “aim and idea” of the Four-Year
Plan. He promised Goering his complete support and cooperation,
and urged that Goering draw upon Schacht’s long experience
in economic affairs. Thus, in Schacht’s letter of 5 August
1937, to Goering, he said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The aim and the idea of the Four Year Plan were and remain
entirely correct and necessary! It stands, essentially,
for the application of increased energy to the efforts already
undertaken by my ministry since 1934 with the results shown
in the above statistics. As you will remember, I welcomed it
when your energy, my dear Prime Minister, was recruited by
the Fuehrer for these tasks, and from the very beginning I
gave you my most loyal support and cooperation, with the
particular plea that I be given a hearing from time to time,
since I believed that my more than thirty years of experience
in economic life, half of them in public service, could be of
value to you.” (<span class='it'>EC-497</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Goering, however, failed to avail himself of Schacht’s offer of
his services. “I can only regret,” said Schacht in the aforementioned
<span class='pageno' title='762' id='Page_762'></span>
letter, “that you have made so little use of my offer” (<span class='it'>EC-497</span>).
Instead, Goering began to encroach upon powers which had
been delegated to Schacht, and they became embroiled in a bitter
jurisdictional conflict. On 26 November 1936, Goering issued a
directive regarding raw and synthetic material production, whereby
he undertook to assume control over large economic areas previously
within Schacht’s province (<span class='it'>EC-243</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht did not supinely accept Goering’s intrusions upon his
powers. Goering’s directive was countered by an abrupt order
from Schacht to all supervisory offices to accept orders from him
alone (<span class='it'>EC-376</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conflict reached such dimensions that it threatened to retard
the pace of the conspirators’ armament program. The military
sided with Schacht, who had provided the means for their
rapid rearmament. They submitted proposals which would have
assured to Schacht as Plenipotentiary General for the War Economy
the responsibility for “unified preparation of the war economy
as heretofore” (<span class='it'>EC-408</span>; <span class='it'>EC-420</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In January 1937, the German Military Weekly Gazette published
an article warmly praising Schacht’s achievements in rearmament.
The timing of the article indicates that it was a further
attempt by the military to tip the scales in Schacht’s favor.
The article stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The German Defense Force commemorates Dr. Schacht
today as one of the men who have done imperishable things
for it and its development in accordance with directions from
the Fuehrer and Reich Chancellor. The Defense Force owes
it to Schacht’s skill and great ability that, in defiance of all
currency difficulties, it, according to plan, has been able to
grow up to its present strength from an army of 100,000
men.” (<span class='it'>EC-383</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Shortly thereafter, Schacht attempted to force a showdown
with Goering by temporarily refusing to act in his capacity as
Plenipotentiary. Schacht plainly was using his prime importance
in the conspirators’ program of economic planning and
preparation for war as a lever. In a letter to Hitler dated 22
February 1937, General von Blomberg, the Minister of War, suggested
a settlement of the jurisdictional fight under which Schacht
would fully retain his powers as General Plenipotentiary of War
Economy, and concluded by stating:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“If you, my Fuehrer, agree with my view regarding these
jurisdictional questions, it may be possible to induce Reichsbank
President Dr. Schacht, whose cooperation as Plenipotentiary
<span class='pageno' title='763' id='Page_763'></span>
for preparation of war is of great significance,
to resume his former activity.” (<span class='it'>EC-244</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As a further demonstration of the community of interest between
Schacht and the top German military authorities, Schacht
attended the secret “War Economy” games at Godesberg in the
latter part of May 1937. The purpose of the games was to demonstrate
“how the action of the soldiers in total war is influenced
by economy and how on the other hand, economy is completely
dependent on military operations”. Schacht’s attendance was
acclaimed at the games as</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“renewed proof that you are willing to facilitate for us soldiers
the difficult war-economic preparations and to
strengthen the harmonious cooperation with your offices.”
(<span class='it'>EC-174</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In June 1937, Keitel implored Hitler to accelerate a final agreement
between Schacht and Goering. Speaking of arrangements
concerning cooperation of these two key figures, Keitel said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I know that a necessary practical basis for it [the arrangement
for cooperation between Schacht and Goering] has
already been found, and only a formal agreement is needed
in order to carry on the common work.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“* * * to waste time in our situation would be the greatest
reproach that history could make upon us.</p>

<p>“May I beg, therefore, once more that the arrangement mentioned
be expedited, and that I be notified accordingly.”
(<span class='it'>EC-248</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, on 7 July 1937, Schacht and Goering signed an agreement
of reconciliation in Berlin, wherein it was said that the
tasks of Goering and Schacht “are being solved in closest mutual
cooperation,” and that “no doubt exists about the fact that the
Commissioner General for War Economy has the position of a
supreme authority of the Reich” (<span class='it'>EC-384</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht resumed his duties as General Plenipotentiary with
renewed vigor. On the day following his formal agreement with
Goering, he wrote to General von Blomberg on “Measures for
the preparation of the conduct of war,” pledging continued cooperation
in their mutual endeavors:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * by the direction of the supreme authority for the
conduct of war, the coordination of the conduct of war will
be assured in its execution through mutual agreement between
you and me, which I look upon as a matter of course
<span class='pageno' title='764' id='Page_764'></span>
in the Central Authority and without which I cannot envisage
any conduct of war. The direction of the economy by
the plenipotentiary would in that event never ‘take place
entirely independent from the rest of the war mechanism’
but would be aimed at the accomplishment of the political
war purpose with the mustering of all economic forces. I
am entirely willing, therefore, to participate in this way in
the preparation of the forthcoming order giving effect to the
Reich Defense Act [<span class='it'>Reichsverteidigungsgesetz</span>].” (<span class='it'>EC-252</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>However, Schacht and Goering were soon again in disagreement.
After a sharp exchange of letters in which each sought
to justify his particular economic program as the best means of
making possible the attainment of Hitler’s objectives (<span class='it'>EC-497</span>;
<span class='it'>EC-493</span>), Schacht suggested to Goering in a curt letter dated
26 August 1937, that he (Goering) assume sole charge of economic
policies. In this letter, Schacht rationalized his precipitate
action as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“To me it does not seem to be of decisive importance to raise
questions of competence and initiative, but it is of decisive
importance that the Fuehrer’s economic policy should be
carried out in a coherent manner, and with the least amount
of friction.” (<span class='it'>EC-283</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Despite the uncompromising tenor of the latter communication,
Schacht was still amenable to an arrangement with Goering
which would have permitted him a measure of autonomy in economic
planning and preparation for war. On 1 November 1937,
he attended a conference with Goering</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * which led in an entirely friendly manner to the
working out of a series of proposals, which * * * Goering
promised to have presented to me [Schacht] in writing on
the following day * * * so that, after having reached an
agreement we could present a mutually approved text to you,
my Fuehrer.” (<span class='it'>EC-495</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>But the written agreement was not forthcoming as Goering
had promised, and Schacht repeated his request to be relieved
from the Ministry of Economics, “in the interest of a uniform
government management” (<span class='it'>EC-495</span>). Hitler finally accepted
Schacht’s resignation as Minister of Economics on 26 November
1937, simultaneously appointing him Minister Without Portfolio.
Schacht’s resignation was also extended to his position as Plenipotentiary
for War Economy (<span class='it'>EC-494</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In subsequent interrogations, both Schacht and Goering have
confirmed the fact that Schacht’s withdrawal was simply the result
<span class='pageno' title='765' id='Page_765'></span>
of a losing struggle with Goering to retain personal power
(<span class='it'>3730-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3728-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is nothing to indicate that Schacht’s withdrawal from
the Ministry of Economics and the Office of Plenipotentiary for
War Economy in any sense represented a break with Hitler on
the ground of contemplated military aggression. He consented
to retain his position as President of the Reichsbank, where he
remained undisputed master, and accepted the post of Minister
of[without] Portfolio, in order to be Hitler’s “personal adviser.” In the
letter accepting Schacht’s resignation as Minister of Economics,
Hitler said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“If I accede to your wish it is with the expression of deepest
gratitude for your so excellent achievements and in the happy
consciousness that, as President of the Reichsbank Directorium,
you will make available for the German people and me
for many years more your outstanding knowledge and ability
and your untiring working strength. Delighted at the fact
that in the future, also, you are willing to be my personal
adviser, I appoint you as of today a Reich Minister.” (<span class='it'>L-104</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As President of the Reichsbank, Schacht continued to carry out
Hitler’s policies. As previously shown, he participated in the
planning of the invasion of Austria by fixing the conversion rate
of the Austrian Schilling in advance of the invasion; and under
his direction, the Austrian National Bank was merged into the
Reichsbank. He publicly approved the absorption of Austria and
the acquisition of the Sudetenland. He continued to finance armaments
by “mefo” bill credits until April 1938, and thereafter,
until his resignation in January 1939, authorized an increase of
approximately 2.6 billion Reichsmarks in bank notes in order to
discount commercial paper which was used in connection with
the armament program. (<span class='it'>EC-438</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Schacht’s dismissal from the Presidency of the Reichsbank.</span>
Schacht was dismissed from the Presidency of the Reichsbank
in January 1939. The evidence indicates that Schacht engineered
his dismissal in order to escape personal responsibility
for what he believed to be an impending financial crisis; he was
not dismissed because of disagreement with the ultimate objectives
of the conspiracy or common plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht had always feared an inflation in Germany. As early
as May 1936, he emphatically stated that he would “never be
party to an inflation” (<span class='it'>1301-PS</span>). In January 1939, Schacht was
convinced that ruinous inflation was, in fact, imminent (<span class='it'>EC-369</span>).
There was, it appears, ample basis for his fear. The Finance
<span class='pageno' title='766' id='Page_766'></span>
Minister, von Krosigk, had already recognized the situation in
September 1938, and had written to Hitler warning that</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * we are steering towards a serious financial crisis,
the forebodings of which have led already abroad to detailed
discussions of this weak side in our economic preparations
and to an apprehensive loss of confidence domestically.”
(<span class='it'>EC-419</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Schacht was not only afraid of a financial crisis; he was even
more fearful that he personally would be held responsible for it
and his prestige would suffer a crushing blow. One of his associates
at the Reichsbank has stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“When Schacht saw that the risky situation which he had
sponsored was becoming insoluble, he was more and more
anxious to get out. This desire to get out of a bad situation
was for a long time the ‘leitmotif’ of Schacht’s conversations
with the directors of the bank.” (<span class='it'>EC-438</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the end, Schacht deliberately stimulated his dismissal from
the Presidency of the Reichsbank by arbitrarily refusing an end-of-the-month
loan in a relatively small amount to the Reich, contrary
to well established practice (<span class='it'>3730-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3731-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Despite differences of opinion concerning the limits to which
the German economy might be pushed without plunging the
country into inflation, Schacht continued to enjoy Hitler’s confidence.
In his letter to Schacht dated 19 January 1939, Hitler
stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“On the occasion of your recall from Office as President of
the Reichsbank Directory, I take the opportunity to express
to you my most sincere and warmest gratitude for the services
which you rendered repeatedly to Germany and to me
personally in this capacity during long and difficult years.
Your name, above all, will always be connected with the first
epoch of the national rearmament. I am happy to be able
to avail myself of your services for the solution of new tasks
in your position as Reich Minister.” (<span class='it'>EC-397</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On his side, Schacht evidenced his abiding faith in Hitler and
his continued agreement with his aggressive policies, by remaining
as Minister without Portfolio until January 1943. As such
he received a large salary from the Nazi Government and enjoyed
the emoluments of public office (<span class='it'>3724-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Conclusion.</span> Schacht’s assistance in the earlier phase of
the conspiracy was an important factor in enabling the conspirators
to seize the German state and thus pave the way for
their later crimes. His work was indispensable to the rearmament
<span class='pageno' title='767' id='Page_767'></span>
of Germany and to the economic planning and preparation
required to launch the German wars of aggression. As long as
he remained in power, he worked as eagerly for the preparation
of aggressive war as any of his co-conspirators. He personally
was favorably disposed towards aggression, if “Lebensraum”
for Germany could not otherwise be attained. He knew that
Hitler intended to and would break the peace, and with this
knowledge, he willingly and purposely contributed his efforts. His
withdrawal from three of his four posts reflected no moral feeling
against the use of aggressive warfare as an instrument of national
policy; he withdrew for reasons wholly unrelated to Hitler’s
program of illegal aggression. By the time of his withdrawal
from these three positions, he had already provided his co-conspirators
with the physical means and economic planning necessary
to launch and maintain their wars of aggression; and he
continued in his lucrative fourth position (Minister without Portfolio)
until January 1943—until, in short, it became doubtful
whether the conspirators could maintain the successes which they
had gained in the wars they had illegally launched and were
waging.</p>

<h3>A. <span class='it'>IN FURTHERANCE OF THE NAZI CONSPIRACY, KRUPP CIRCUMVENTED THE RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES ON THE REARMAMENT OF GERMANY. AS THE RESPONSIBLE HEAD OF THE HUGE ARMAMENTS CONCERN, FRIED. KRUPP A.G., HE CONCEALED ITS ARMAMENT ACTIVITY IN ORDER TO DECEIVE THE ALLIED GOVERNMENTS.

Since the name of Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach was severed
from the Nurnberg trial which commenced on 20 November 1945, the trial
brief outlining the case against Krupp, which was prepared before his
severance, was not presented to the Tribunal. Despite his personal absence
from the prisoners’ dock, however, Krupp remained technically still under
indictment and liable to prosecution in subsequent proceedings. Moreover,
Krupp was still regarded by the prosecution as a member of the Nazi conspiracy.
The following summary of evidence, adapted from the trial brief,
is included here in order to show the role played by Krupp as co-conspirator.</p>

</div>

<hr class='footnotemark'/>

<p class='pindent'>In an article entitled “Manager and Armament Worker” written
for the 1 March 1942 issue of the Krupp magazine, Krupp
stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * I knew German history well, and out of my experiences
in the rest of the world I believed to know the
German kind; therefore I never doubted that, although for
the time being all indications were against it, one day a
change would come. How, I never knew or asked, but I believed
in it. But with this knowledge—and today I may
speak about these things and for the first time I am doing
this extensively and publicly—with this, as responsible head
of the Krupp works, consequences of the greatest importance
had to be taken. If Germany should ever be reborn, if it
should shake off the chains of Versailles one day, the Krupp
concern had to be prepared again. * * *”</p>

<p>“* * * I wanted and had to maintain Krupp, in spite of
all opposition, as an armament plant for the later future,
even if in camouflaged form. I could only speak in the
smallest, most intimate circles about the real reasons which
made me undertake the changeover of the plants for certain
lines of production for I had to expect that many people
would not understand me. * * *”
<span class='pageno' title='775' id='Page_775'></span></p>

<p>“Without arousing any commotion, the necessary measures
and preparations were undertaken. Thus to the surprise of
many people Krupp began to manufacture goods which really
appeared to be far distant from the former work of an
armament plant. Even the Allied snooping commissions
were duped. Padlocks, milk cans, cash registers, track repair
machines, trash carts and similar ‘small junk’ appeared
really unsuspicious and even locomotives and automobiles
made an entirely ‘civilian’ impression.</p>

<p>“After the accession to power of Adolf Hitler I had the satisfaction
of being able to report to the Fuehrer that Krupps
stood ready, after a short warming-up period, to begin the
rearmament of the German people without any gaps of experience,—the
blood of the comrades of KAR. Saturday
1923 had not been shed in vain. Since that time I was often
permitted to accompany the Fuehrer through the old and
new workshops and to experience how the workers of Krupp
cheered him in gratitude. In the years after 1933 we worked
with an incredible intensity and when the war did break
out the speed and results were again increased. We are all
proud of having thus contributed to the heretofore magnificent
successes of our army.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“I have always considered it to be an honour as well as an
obligation to be the head of an arms factory and I know
that the employees of Krupp share these feelings. Thanks
to the educational work of the National Socialist Government
this is the case all over Germany. I know that the things I
have said here about the armament worker in particular hold
true for every German worker. With these men and women
who work for the cause with all their hearts, with cool heads
and skilled hands we will master every fate.” (<span class='it'>D-94</span>; see
<span class='it'>D-64</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In a memorandum of a conference held on 9 December 1942,
concerning the proposed publication of a book dealing with
Krupp’s armament activities, Von Bulow, confidential secretary
to Krupp, wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“For the period of transition from 1919 up to rearmament,
A. K. [Krupp] had undertaken various tasks in order to keep
up the Company’s activity in the field of artillery, in the
sense of observing activities in that field in the rest of the
world (relation: BOFORS) and then also for the production
of artillery material, within and to a certain extent also beyond,
<span class='pageno' title='776' id='Page_776'></span>
the limitation established by the peace dictate.”
(<span class='it'>D-249</span>).</p>

</div>

<h3>B. <span class='it'>AFTER THE CONSPIRATORS’ ACCESSION TO POWER, KRUPP LENT HIS INFLUENCE, PRESTIGE, AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF THEIR CONTROL OVER THE GERMAN STATE.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(1) With knowledge of the aims and purposes of the Nazi
conspiracy, he sought to reorganize the Reich Association of
German Industry, of which he was Chairman, so as to bring
it into line with the aims of the conspirators and to make it an
effective instrument for the execution of their policies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) Upon the invitation of Goering (<span class='it'>D-201</span>), Krupp attended
a meeting in Berlin on 20 February 1933, during which Hitler,
in a speech to a select group of industrialists, announced the conspirators’
aims to seize totalitarian control over Germany, to destroy
the parliamentary system, to crush all opposition by force,
and to restore the power of the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>. In the course of this
speech, Hitler stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Private enterprise cannot be maintained in the age of
Democracy; it is conceivable only if the people have a sound
idea of authority and personality. * * * Life always
tears up humanity. It is therefore the noblest task of a
Leader to find ideals that are stronger than the factors that
pull the people apart. I recognized even while in the hospital
that one had to search for new ideas conducive to reconstruction.
I found them in Nationalism, in the value of
personality, in the denial of reconciliation between nations,
in the strength and power of individual personality. * * *
If one rejects pacifism, one must put a new idea in its place
immediately. Everything must be pushed aside, must be replaced
by something better.”</p>

<p>“* * * We must not forget that all the benefits of culture
must be introduced more or less with an iron fist, just as
once upon a time the farmers were forced to plant potatoes.
For all this, however, courage, and iron will and perseverance
are essential.”</p>

<p>“* * * With the very same courage with which we go to
work to make up for what had been sinned during the last
14 years, we have withstood all attempts to move us off the
right way. We have turned down the favour (benevolence)
of the Catholic Centre Party [<span class='it'>Zentrum</span>] to tolerate us.
<span class='pageno' title='777' id='Page_777'></span>
Hugemberg has too small a movement. He has only considerably
slowed down our development. We must first gain
complete power if we want to crush the other side completely.
While still gaining power one should not start the
struggle against the opponent. Only when one knows that
one has reached the pinnacle of power, that there is no
further possible upward development, shall one strike.
* * *”</p>

<p>“Now we stand before the last election. Regardless of the
outcome there will be no retreat, even if the coming election
does not bring about a decision. One way or another, if the
election does not decide, the decision must be brought about
even by other means. I have intervened in order to give the
people once more the chance to decide their fate by themselves.
This determination is a strong asset for whatever
must possibly happen later. Does the election bring no result,
well, Germany won’t go to ruin. Today, as never before,
everyone is under the obligation to pledge himself to
success. The necessity to make sacrifices has never been
greater than now. For Economy I have the one wish that it
go parallel with the internal structure to meet a calm
future. The question of restoration of the Wehrmacht will
not be decided at Geneva, but in Germany, when we have
gained internal strength through internal peace. * * *
There are only two possibilities, either to crowd back the
opponent on constitutional grounds, and for this purpose
once more this election or a struggle will be conducted with
other weapons, which may demand greater sacrifices. I
would like to see them avoided. I hope the German people
thus recognize the greatness of the hour. It shall decide over
the next 10 or probably even 100 years. It will become a
turning point in German history, to which I pledge myself
with glowing energy.” (<span class='it'>D-203</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At this same meeting, Goering declared that the impending
election of 5 March 1933 would certainly be the last one for the
next 10 years, and probably even for the next 100 years (<span class='it'>D-203</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a memorandum dated 22 February 1933 describing this
meeting, Krupp wrote that he had expressed to Hitler the gratitude
of approximately 25 industrialists present for the clear expression
of his views and emphasized, on behalf of all present,
that it was time to clarify the political situation in Germany
(<span class='it'>D-204</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) On 25 April 1933, Krupp, as Chairman of the Reich Association
of German Industry (<span class='it'>Reichsverbandes der Deutschen Industrie</span>)
<span class='pageno' title='778' id='Page_778'></span>
submitted to Hitler his plan for the reorganization of
German industry and in connection therewith, undertook to bring
the Association into line with the aims of the conspirators and to
make it an effective instrument for the execution of their policies.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p><span class='it'>1.</span> In the letter of transmittal, Krupp stated that his plan
of reorganization was characterized by the desire to
coordinate “economic measures and political necessity,
adopting the Fuehrer’s conception of the New
German State” (<span class='it'>D-157</span>).</p>

<p><span class='it'>2.</span> In the plan of reorganization itself Krupp stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The turn of political events is in line with the
wishes which I myself and the Board of Directors
have cherished for a long time. I am convinced
that, under the threat of the impoverishment of
our people, the machinery of government must be
simplified to the utmost. For the same reason I
did not fail to recognize a long time ago the necessity
of rationalizing our economic system.</p>

<p>“Convinced that the opportunity of the hour must
not be missed to obtain the best for our economic
system, I am employing the authority bestowed
upon me by the Presiding Council to carry out a
double task:—</p>

<p>1. In the negotiations with the Reichschancellor
and his representatives I shall make it my goal to
coordinate, in the field of organization of industrial
associations, the economically reasonable with
the politically necessary.</p>

<p>2. In reorganizing the Reich Association of German
Industry I shall be guided by the idea of
bringing the new organization into agreement
with the political aims of the Reich Government
and at the same time to make it so rational and
forceful that it can be an effective instrument of
industrial enterprise, according to the relative
importance of the industry.” (<span class='it'>D-157</span>)</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) In a speech delivered on 18 October 1933, on the occasion
of the first meeting of the Committee for Industrial and Social
policy of the Reich Association of German Industry, Krupp reaffirmed
his aim to bring the Association into complete accord
with the political goals of the Nazi government and stated, <span class='it'>inter
alia</span>:
<span class='pageno' title='779' id='Page_779'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * To have united the purposes of an entire Nation,
is the great historical achievement of the man in whose strong
hands our President has placed the fate of our people. When
Reichschancellor and Fuehrer Adolf Hitler called the General
Council of Economy together for the first time on the 20th of
September, I had the honor to thank him for the confidence
which he had put in the men of the practical business world
by calling them to the General Council. I pledged to him unrestrained
support in his Government in its exceedingly difficult
task from all branches and organizations of Economy.</p>

<p>“I may repeat now what I said then: ‘The unshakable faith
of our Reichschancellor and Fuehrer in the future of our
people gives also to the men of business the courage and the
strength to put everything in the reconstruction of a healthy
National Economy in a strong National State under National
Socialist leadership’.</p>

<p>“You, too, gentlemen, if I am certain of your confidence, are
bound to this pledge. It holds in itself, for all of us, the
deeply felt obligation to be the guarantors for the unconditional
execution of the Fuehrer’s will in all links and branches
of Industry. May the spirit of devotion to duty which inspires
us always dominate this Committee’s conferences!</p>

<p>“I ask you, gentlemen, to rise and to join me in the toast: To
the venerable President of the German Reich, General Fieldmarshal
Von Hindenburg and the German People’s Chancellor
and Fuehrer, Adolf Hitler: ‘<span class='it'>Sieg Heil</span>’.” (<span class='it'>D-353</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(2) Krupp organized, sponsored, and made substantial financial
contributions to the Hitler Fund (<span class='it'>Hitler Spende</span>), with knowledge
that the funds were to be used to further the objectives of the SA
and SS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) In a letter to Schacht dated 30 May 1933, Krupp wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“As Dr. Hoettgen and I had the opportunity of mentioning
to you yesterday, it is proposed to initiate a collection in the
most far-reaching circles of German industry, including agriculture
and the banking world, which is to be put at the disposal
of the Fuehrer of the NSDAP in the name of ‘The Hitler
Fund’, which would replace collections in many cases separately
organized of the various NSDAP organizations and
the Stahlhelm. It has been decided to appoint a management
council for this central collection; I have accepted the chairmanship
of the management council at the unanimous request
of the principal federations, inspired by the wish to

collaborate with my full strength in this task which is to be
a symbol of gratitude to the Fuehrer of the nation.” (<span class='it'>D-151</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) A circular written by Hess in August 1933, which was
found among Krupp’s files, specifically states that one of the
purposes of the Hitler Fund is “to put at the disposal of the Reich
leadership the funds required for the unified execution of the
tasks which fall to the lot of the SA, SS, ST, HJ, political organizations
etc.” (<span class='it'>D-151</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a letter dated 15 August 1934, from Lutze, Chief of Staff of
the SA, which was found among Krupp’s papers, authority was
granted, with the approval of the Deputy Fuehrer, to Gauleiter
Terboven to use a special part of the year’s Hitler Fund in the
interest of the SA in the Ruhr district (<span class='it'>D-368</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) From the inception of the Hitler Fund until the collapse of
Germany, the Fried. Krupp Cast Steel Works in Essen (main company
in the Krupp organization) alone contributed 4,738,446
marks to that fund (<span class='it'>D-325</span>; the above figure is the total amount
shown on the chart, not here reproduced<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a>). This assistance to the
Hitler Fund was supplemented by large contributions made by the
other Krupp companies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) Krupp, both privately and through the Krupp firm, made

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) In June 1935, Krupp contributed 100,000 marks to the
Nazi Party out of his personal account (<span class='it'>D-332</span>; <span class='it'>D-373</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) In numerous public addresses, Krupp supported the measures
adopted by the conspirators in the execution of their program.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) In a speech urging every German to approve Germany’s
withdrawal from the disarmament conference and the League of
Nations, Krupp said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * Just as the 5th of March brought about the change
from chaos to order, from disgrace to honor in domestic policy
so, on November 12, the unanimous “Yes” of the German
people concerning the foreign policy of the Reich Government,
shall and must give ample proof to the entire world that every
citizen who is worthy of the German name, stands unconditionally
<span class='pageno' title='781' id='Page_781'></span>
behind the Reich Government as led by the Reich
Chancellor, and its foreign policy which is dictated by the
commandment of self-respect.”</p>

<p>“* * * When the radio broadcasts the results of the
People’s Election on the evening of November 12, the entire
world must know that: Germany stands in the camp of Adolf
Hitler.” (<span class='it'>D-393</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) In a speech delivered on 26 January 1934, Krupp expressed
approval of the leadership principle in industrial relations, under
which the entrepreneur became the leader and the workers became
his followers. In the course of this speech he said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“National-Socialism has liberated the German worker from
the clutches of a doctrine which was basically hostile both for
employer and employee. Adolf Hitler has returned the worker
to his nation; he has made of him a disciplined soldier of labor
and therefore our comrade. When, on the other hand, the
new State awards to the enterpriser the role of leader in economy
and labor, then we know that: Leadership has obligation!</p>

<p>“The enterpriser and his leading officers are the trustees for
the material welfare of our people.” (<span class='it'>D-392</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) In a speech delivered on 10 August 1934, in connection with
the plebiscite to approve Hitler’s dual appointment as president
and chancellor after Hindenburg’s death, Krupp said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Let us all follow him now also, our Leader, our Reich—and
People’s Chancellor.</p>

<p>“In an exceptionally short time he has eliminated the quarrel
between parties, has guaranteed unity to the Reich and has
assured to every German pride to work, has brought the opportunity
for work to the near future. On 19 August all our
votes borne of deep trust and proven confidence shall go to
the man acclaimed by those hearts of many thousands and
millions who cannot, because of their age, go to the polls but
who daily join us, who are permitted to vote, in the Cry:</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>Heil Hitler!” (<span class='it'>D-386</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>d</span>) In a speech dated 27 October 1935, Krupp stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * Our thoughts fly therefore by themselves in this
festive hour of our plant community, to the man whom we
thank for the resurrection of our Nation: Adolf Hitler, the
patron of German labour and German art. Unanimously
we will confess and pledge ourselves to stand behind the
<span class='pageno' title='782' id='Page_782'></span>
Fuehrer and his movement today and forever and thereby
to be of service to the idea of eternal Germany.” (<span class='it'>D-385</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>e</span>) In a speech dated 1 May 1936, after the Nazis had reoccupied
and fortified the Rhineland, Krupp stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“No greater recognition, no greater incentive to further
common work accomplishment could have been given us
than was done through the visit of our Fuehrer on March
27th of this year to our works and through his addresses
from here. * * *”</p>

<p>“Never has a statesman fought for the soul of his people
and for its well-being with such faith, such ardor, such endurance.
We shall never forget how deeply we are indebted
to him. * * * I only mention here the abolition of the
parties and the unification of the people, the regaining of the
sovereignty in the Rhineland, the extensive abolition of unemployment,
the accomplishments of the labour service, the
magnificent public buildings, the roads, bridges and canals.
* * *”</p>

<p>“The world will have to get used to the fact that the voice
of the Fuehrer is the voice of the whole German people.
* * *”</p>

<p>“Jubileers and co-workers! We shall be thankful to fate
that we were and are permitted to be eye and action witnesses
of the great turning point in our German history,
and we shall thank especially the divine destiny that it has
presented us with a man like Adolf Hitler. Let us then combine
all that which moves our hearts upon mention of this
name into the cry: Our people and fatherland and its great
Fuehrer Adolf Hitler</p>

<h3>C. <span class='it'>UNDER KRUPP’S DIRECTION, THE KRUPP FIRM, BY DEVELOPING NEW INSTRUMENTS OF WAR AND PRODUCING HUGE QUANTITIES OF WAR MATERIALS, FURTHERED THE CONSPIRATORS’ PROGRAM TO CREATE A POWERFUL MILITARY POTENTIAL.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(1) In a speech prepared in January 1944, for delivery at
the University of Berlin, Krupp stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * I don’t see why this thought still flutters in many
a head occasionally—that the production of war materials
should be a sinister trade! No: war material is life-saving
for one’s own people and whoever works and performs in
<span class='pageno' title='783' id='Page_783'></span>
these spheres can be proud of it; here enterprise as a whole
finds its highest justification of existence. This justification—I
may inject this here—crystallized especially during that
time of the ‘Interregnum’, between 1919 and 1933, when
Germany was lying-down disarmed. * * * It is the one
great merit of the entire German war economy that it did
not remain idle during those bad years, even though its
activity could not be brought to light for obvious reasons.
Through years of secret work, scientific and basic ground
work was laid, in order to be ready again to work the German
Armed Forces at the appointed hour, without loss of
time or experience.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“Only through this secret activity of German enterprise, together
with the experience gained meanwhile through production
of peace time goods was it possible after 1933, to
fall into step with the new tasks arrived at restoring Germany’s
military power, (only through all that) could the
entirely new and various problems, brought up by the
Fuehrer’s Four Year’s Plan for German enterprise, be
mastered. * * *” (<span class='it'>D-317</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(2) Krupp played a leading role in the design and production
of new weapons for the German armed forces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) In a memorandum concerning a conference held at the
Federal Ministry for National Defense in Vienna on 25 September
1936, Pfirsch, a Krupp official, wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * in spite of the obstacles put in our way by the
Treaty of Versailles, we had never been inactive throughout
the postwar period, but had drawn upon the experience of
the war in the creation of new types, and that we had won
the prizes for almost every type in the competitions organized
by our War Ministry for the construction of new artillery
weapons, so much so that the guns introduced into the
German Army of to-day, such as the 8.8 cm. anti-aircraft,
the 10.5 cm. field gun, the heavy field howitzer and beyond
them the larger calibres have been made according to our
pattern.” (<span class='it'>D-152</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) In a memorandum dated 21 February 1944, Woelfert, a
department chief in the Krupp concern, wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“First a few facts about the development of tanks by Krupp.
We are manufacturing tanks since 1928, which means before
rearmament. We started studying on heavy tractors. Krupp
built the first mass production tank, the Panzer I, which is
<span class='pageno' title='784' id='Page_784'></span>
also known as LaS. It was shown in public in 1935, the year
when rearmament started, and made a great impression. We
also originated the Panzer IV, or better the BW, which was
especially at the beginning of the war one of the prime factors
in our rapid advances into enemy country, so that today
we are fighting on the Atlantic coast, in the South, and
east and not on German soil. Even today we use the BW-base
for many self-propelled guns, assault-guns, anti-aircraft
guns etc.” (<span class='it'>D-96</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) In a letter to Hitler dated 24 July 1942, Krupp wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“My Fuehrer!</p>

<p>“The big weapon, whose manufacturing is to be thanked to
your command, has now proved its effectiveness. * * *”</p>

<p>“True to an example set by Alfred Krupp in 1870, my wife
and myself ask the favour that the Krupp works refrain
from charging for this first finished product.</p>

<p>“To express my thanks to you, my Fuehrer, for the confidence
shown in our plants and in us personally by entrusting
such an order with us, is a pleasant duty for my wife
and myself.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;'><span class='it'>Sieg Heil!</span>” (<span class='it'>D-375</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>d</span>) Krupp likewise made significant contributions to the production
of Navy weapons and U-Boats (<span class='it'>D-88</span>; <span class='it'>D-287</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) The rapid and progressive expansion in armament production
by Krupp after the conspirators’ accession to power is
plainly shown by a chart prepared by Krupp officials concerning
the production of war materials at the <span class='it'>Krupp Gustahlfabrik</span> in
Essen (only one of the many companies in the Krupp organization).
This chart shows that the production of war materials
at that particular factory during the fiscal year, 1 October 1933
to 30 September 1934, was more than twice that of any previous
year since 1929; that such production during the fiscal year, 1
October 1934 to 30 September 1935, was almost twice as great
as the previous year; and that production of war materials continued
thereafter at an accelerated rate with the result that during
the fiscal year, 1 October 1938 to 30 September 1939, it was
more than 10 times as great as it was during the period 1 October
1932 to 30 September 1933 (Chart entitled “Fried. Krupp
Gustahlfabrik Essen, Turnover in War Material,” not reproduced
here). It should be noted that this chart shows only direct sales
by the Essen factory of war materials to the German Armed
Forces Ordnance Supply Department and sales to foreign countries
of war materials easily recognizable as such. It does not
<span class='pageno' title='785' id='Page_785'></span>
cover indirect sales, viz: the sale of products to other concerns
which, in turn, used them to produce materials of war. (The chart
entitled “Fried. Krupp and Branch Establishments, Inland Turnover,”
not here reproduced, shows figures which include “indirect”
sales of war materials by certain Krupp companies.)</p>

<h3>D. <span class='it'>KRUPP GOVERNED THE EXPORTS OF HIS FIRM IN THE LIGHT OF THE MILITARY REQUIREMENTS OF THE NAZI CONSPIRATORS AND THE ACCEPTED AND DISCHARGED IMPORTANT ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSIBILITIES IN FURTHERANCE OF THE CONSPIRATORS’ PROGRAM OF ECONOMIC MOBILIZATION FOR WAR.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(1) In a “strictly confidential” memorandum dated 25 March
1941, the following was reported:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * The liberation of the Reich from the shackles of
Versailles enabled Krupp to recommence the export of armaments.
The German Government had, in fact, pressed for
the matter. Military-political and Military-economic reasons
were the cause. Krupp desired to come into the closest contact
with the armament exports, so as to further the development
of arms * * *”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“* * * By using all the forces at his [Krupp’s] disposal
and regardless of effort, costs and risk, considerable export
contracts were secured, which served to obtain foreign currency
or raw materials, and were, at the same time, politically
desirable. * * *” (<span class='it'>D-191</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In a memorandum dated 23 June 1937, concerning a Bulgarian
order for armour plating which was discussed with German Army
representatives, Reiff, a Krupp official, wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Major Olbrich showed himself aware quite evidently of the
deeper reasons existing why Germany was anxious that this
order should be booked. * * *” (<span class='it'>D-154</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(2) At the request of the Inspector of War Production, Krupp
became a Leader of War Production in 1937, and was charged
with the responsibility of preparing and carrying out the mobilization
of the armament industry and of directing it in time of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) In a “strictly confidential” letter dated 21 January 1937,
the Inspector of War Production wrote to Krupp:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Reich Minister for War and the Supreme Commander
of the Armed Forces has ordered that a Corps of Economic
<span class='pageno' title='786' id='Page_786'></span>
Leaders of War Production be recruited with immediate
effect.</p>

<p>“The Economic Leaders of War Production in collaboration
with the Armed Forces, are to be responsible for the preparing
and carrying out of the mobilization of the armament
industry and for directing it in time of war.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“A selected small circle of these persons is to act in an advisory
capacity to the Armed Forces in all important economic
questions both during peace and war.</p>

<p>“Subject to your approval, I intend to propose to the Reich
Minister for War that you should be nominated as Economic
Leader for War Production.” (<span class='it'>D-62</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) In connection with his acceptance of the position of Leader
of War Production, Krupp submitted a “secret” document entitled,
“Declaration of Political Attitude,” dated 6 February 1937,
in which he stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I herewith declare that I stand by the National Socialist
conception of the State without reserve and that I have not
been active in any way against the interests of the people.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“I am aware that should I say or do anything which constitutes
an attack against the National Socialist conception of
the State, I must expect, in addition to legal proceedings,
my dismissal from the post of Economic Leader of War Production.”
(<span class='it'>D-63</span>).</p>

</div>

<h3>E. <span class='it'>KRUPP SUPPORTED THE CONSPIRATORS’ PROPAGANDA PROGRAM; LENT HIS ORGANIZATION TO THE DISSEMINATION OF NAZI PROPAGANDA ABROAD; AND USED HIS EMPLOYEES IN ESPIONAGE ACTIVITIES IN FURTHERANCE OF THE AIMS AND PURPOSES OF THE NAZI CONSPIRACY.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(1) In April 1933, Krupp contributed 20,000 marks to Rosenberg
for the purpose of counteracting anti-Nazi propaganda
abroad. In a letter to Krupp dated 26 April 1933, Rosenberg
said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Once more my most cordial thanks for not having shunned
the inconvenience of the journey in order to participate at
yesterday’s intimate conference. I am glad to determine, on
the basis of our discussion, that you too welcome the organization
<span class='pageno' title='787' id='Page_787'></span>
of an active counter-action abroad, in the interest of
State and Economy, and express to you the highest thanks
for the support of a monetary kind as well, which you have
subscribed to our work. Very shortly a quantity of material
will be sent to you promptly and will subsequently be distributed
throughout the world in a comprehensive compilation.”

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(2) In a memorandum dated 12 October 1939, entitled “Distribution
of Official Propaganda Literature Abroad with the Help
of our Foreign Connections,” concerning a visit by a Mr. Lackmann
of Ribbentrop’s private foreign office, Von Raussendorff, a
Krupp official, wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I informed Mr. L. that our Firm had put itself years ago
at the disposal of official Bureaus for purposes of foreign
propaganda and that we had supported all requests addressed
to us to the utmost. * * * Only by personal handling
can our connections abroad be used and kept receptive to
effective propaganda. With the present lively activity of
the ‘Secret Service’ it must be avoided, not only in the interest
of our Firm but also in the interest of Germany as a
whole, that our agents in neutral foreign countries would
come through improper handling to the attention of the
‘Secret Service’ and economically ruined by it within a short
time.</p>

<p>“* * * If additional distributions of propaganda literature
were desired, a propaganda-leaflet should be sent to us,
and after examining it, we would advise the official Bureau
what quantity of such printed matter could be mailed abroad
through us, at our expense, as heretofore.” (<span class='it'>D-206</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(3) In a memorandum dated 14 October 1937, concerning a
visit by Menzel of the Intelligence Office of the Combined Services
Ministry, Sonnenberg, a Krupp official, wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * Menzel asked for intelligence on foreign armaments
(but not including matters published in newspapers)
received by Krupp from their agents abroad and through
other channels to be passed on to Combined Services Intelligence
[Abwehrabteilung des RKM.]. * * *”</p>

<p>“On our part we undertook to supply information to the
Combined Ministry [RKM] as required.” (<span class='it'>D-167</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The results of a later visit by Menzel, in the company of
<span class='it'>Kapitaen zur See</span> Globig, of the Information Department, Naval
Armaments Branch, are reported in a memorandum dated 25
<span class='pageno' title='788' id='Page_788'></span>
June 1939 by Dr. Conn, a Krupp official. In the course of this
memorandum, which is entitled “Intelligence and Information,”
Dr. Conn stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“1. <span class='it'>Kapitaen zur See</span> Globig whom I had known for a long
time, spoke to me quite frankly and openly. It is therefore
impossible to embody parts of our discussion in this report.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“Similarly to Kapitaen zur See Globig he [Menzel] stressed
the point that in view of the progressive disappearance of
public and easily accessible sources of information, the information
obtained through our representatives abroad was
of increasing value. This method of obtaining intelligence
would have to be followed up much more drastically than in
the past.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“His [Menzel’s] third point was a request to utilize foreign
visitors for obtaining intelligence. I replied that this was
being done already, but that it was necessary to proceed very
carefully, to avoid arousing suspicion on the part of the
visitors.”</p>

<p>“I gave him to understand that we were slightly disappointed
with the collaboration with Intelligence [<span class='it'>Abwehr Abteilung</span>]
since we had supplied information, but had received none in
return. Menzel explained that Intelligence was only a collating
centre and that they were merely passing on information,
the value of which they were unable to judge by
themselves, to the departments concerned; any information
for us would therefore have to come from those departments
only. Exceptions were only made in the case of intelligence
of universal importance such as e.g. the long range gun

<h3>F. <span class='it'>KRUPP PUBLICLY APPROVED THE SUCCESSIVE CRIMES AGAINST THE PEACE PERPETRATED BY THE NAZI CONSPIRATORS.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(1) In a speech dated 6 April 1938, shortly after Schuschnigg
had been compelled to capitulate to the Nazi conspirators’ threat
of force, Krupp stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“At our family party, today as well, our first thought, our
first glass, is raised in deep appreciation to our Fuehrer. We
are still under the lasting impression of the mighty happenings
of the last four weeks; so are those of us who until
a short time ago were forced to wait impatiently for these
developments outside our State frontiers. To the fulfillment
of century-old dreams consciously arrived at, to the fulfillment
of the life-long wish of Adolf Hitler—thanks to his
faith, thanks to his determination, thanks to his heart, to
him, our Fuehrer, a threefold, deeply thankful,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;'><span class='it'>Sieg Heil</span>.” (<span class='it'>D-391</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(2) In a speech dated 7 April 1938, Krupp, in urging all Germans
in the impending election of 10 April to approve Hitler’s
invasion of Austria, stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Three more days separate us from the day of the Plebiscite
to which our Fuehrer calls us, from the Plebiscite concerning
Greater Germany, at the same time a Plebiscite in which the
proof of faith in our Fuehrer concerns every individual’s
conscience.</p>

<p>“Full with thanks for what Adolf Hitler has bestowed and
secured for the German people in little more than five years’
leadership through internal and external peace he is worthy
of the deepest felt ‘Yes’ from everyone of us!</p>

<p>“To him, our Fuehrer and Chancellor a threefold</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(3) In a speech delivered on 13 October 1938, on the occasion
of Hitler’s visit to the Krupp works after the Nazi occupation of
the Sudetenland, Krupp said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“My Fuehrer,</p>

<p>“To be able to greet you at the Krupp Works, in our home,
in the name of my wife and my own, as well as in the name
of those close to me and also in that of the greater plant
<span class='pageno' title='790' id='Page_790'></span>
family, so shortly after the world-shaking events of the last
weeks, is a great honour and a heart-felt joy to me.</p>

<p>“Perhaps no plant and no home can feel more deeply and
more gratefully than ours the changes in the last decades;
none can be more proudly conscious to be allowed to participate
in the mighty tasks set by you.</p>

<p>“Before us stands now the basic and undeniable world-encircling
success, in its total extent perhaps not fully
grasped, which your faith and strong will, your nerves and
your initiative have achieved.</p>

<p>“May no German ever forget how deeply gratitude therefore
put us under obligation, how proud we may be to be
recognized once more in the world as a free, equal, great
German People.</p>

<p>“With the thanks of my family, of our plants, of our entire
Ruhr District filled with the urge to work, I must express
united gratitude, springing from a full warm heart, from
the Sudeten District which is now a part of the German
Reich.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“<span class='it'>Heil</span> to Thee, my Fuehrer.” (<span class='it'>D-304</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(4) Shortly after the conspirators launched their aggression
against Poland, Krupp stated to the workers in his plant:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Fuehrer has made his decision, not lightheartedly but
in the consciousness of responsibility to his people, to the
entire future of the German Nation—we have all heard that
in his Reichstag speech last Friday.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“A hard struggle, perhaps hardly appreciated to its fullest
extent, lies before us. The entire German Nation must face
this test of fire in unshakable unity, young or old, man or
woman, everyone must and will do his duty at his post, do
more than just what his duty demands and devote his entire
strength to the task assigned to him. Therefore let us
also, as Krupp Members, remain determined. May God protect
our Fuehrer and our people!” (<span class='it'>D-363</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(5) In a speech dated 6 May 1941, commemorating the successes
of the Nazi aggression in the West, Krupp stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The one who, like myself, had the chance to visit and thoroughly
inspect during the last weeks the fields where our
superb troops made the breakthrough in the West—

<p>“who could hear on that occasion the roar of our Airforce
against England—</p>

<p>“who witnessed how our U-boats and speedboats distinguished
themselves against the remains of England’s sea-might—</p>

<p>“such a person is bound to be thankfully proud to be able
to contribute through his labours to assure to our fighters
the weapons which they need for their battle—</p>

<p>“such a person is and remains devotedly and respectfully
conscious that the nicest machines, the most effective instruments
mean little, no, nothing, without the complete unselfish
and trusting share of the individual, whose trust is
assured through his knowledge of, and his faith in, the
genius of his Fuehrer, who embodies the worth of the German
people, their honour and might. To him, our Fuehrer,
we direct also in this hour in the Spring month of May our
thoughts, renew our solemn oath, present our heartiest
wishes and give thanks to him.</p>

<h3>G. <span class='it'>KRUPP AS HEAD OF THE KRUPP CONCERN, IN FURTHERANCE OF THE COMMON PLAN TO EXPLOIT THE PEOPLE OF OCCUPIED COUNTRIES AND PRISONERS OF WAR, WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPELLING PERSONS FORCIBLY DEPORTED FROM OCCUPIED COUNTRIES AND PRISONERS OF WAR TO WORK AGAINST THEIR WILL AND WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT IN THE MANUFACTURE OF ARMS AND MUNITIONS. THESE ACTS AND PRACTICES WERE CONTRARY TO ARTICLES 6 AND 52 OF THE HAGUE REGULATIONS, 1907, TO ARTICLE 31 OF THE PRISONERS OF WAR CONVENTION (GENEVA 1929), THE LAWS AND CUSTOMS OF WAR, AND TO ARTICLES 6(b) AND 6(c) OF THE CHARTER.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(1) Charts marked “secret” have been found which show the
number and nationalities of prisoners of war and foreign workers
employed in each of the workshops in the Fried. Krupp Cast
Steel Works at Essen, for the period from December 1940 to 1
February 1945. These charts, when read in conjunction with an
affidavit by a Krupp official concerning the materials produced
in the various Essen workshops, reveal that French and Russian
prisoners of war and slave laborers from virtually every country
occupied by Germany were used in the production of arms and
<span class='pageno' title='792' id='Page_792'></span>
munitions. Thus, they were compelled to work in departments
engaged in the construction of turrets for tanks and carriages
for heavy Army and Navy guns; the assembling of marine gun
turrets, 10.5 cm. marine guns, and 15 cm. torpedo-boat guns; the
manufacture of crankshafts for S-boats and aeroplanes, etc.
(Charts and affidavit relating to production in the workshops of
Fried. Krupp Cast Steel Works by prisoners of war and foreign
workers, not here reproduced.) Affidavits of workers in the Krupp
workshops afford added proof that prisoners of war and foreign
laborers were used by Krupp in the manufacture of arms and
munitions (see <span class='it'>D-253</span>, <span class='it'>D-265</span>, <span class='it'>D-279</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) The prisoners of war and foreign workers at the Krupp
factories did not voluntarily engage in the manufacture of arms
and munitions; they were forced to do so. This fact is clearly
shown by the following:</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) Workers were brought to Essen from Poland and Russia
in grossly overcrowded, unheated, and unsanitary cattle cars
and upon debarking, were beaten, kicked, and otherwise inhumanely
treated. An employee of the Reich Railway at Essen
has described these conditions as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * In the middle of 1941 the first workers arrived
from Poland, Galicia and Polish Ukraine. They came to
Essen in goods wagons in which potatoes, building materials
and also cattle have been transported; they were brought
to perform work at Krupp. The cars were jammed full with
people. * * * The people were squashed closely together
and they had no room for free movement. The Krupp
overseers laid special value on the speed the slave workers
got in and out of the train. * * * the people were
beaten and kicked and generally maltreated in a brutal manner.
* * * I could see with my own eyes that sick
people who could scarcely walk * * * were taken to
work. One could see that it was sometimes difficult for them
to move themselves. The same can be said for the Eastern
workers and PWs who came to Essen in the middle of 1942.”
(<span class='it'>D-321</span>; <span class='it'>D-367</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) Foreign workers were compelled to go to work under
guard and were closely watched. In a memorandum dated 7
April 1942, entitled “employment of foreign workers”, from the
Ignitor workshop of the Krupp Essen plant, it is stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“In the course of last week, due to the fact that the foreign
workers, especially Poles, could not be relied upon to appear
<span class='pageno' title='793' id='Page_793'></span>
at work, there was an extraordinary decrease in production;
loss of money and fines did not obtain the desired results.</p>

<p>“Especially during short (bank) holidays we were not able
to find a responsible person in the camp Seumannstrasse, to
whom we could have referred. We ourselves are short of
guards to fetch the Poles from their camp, and to guard
them overnight.” (<span class='it'>D-270</span>; re compulsion exerted by guards
in marching foreign workers to work, see also <span class='it'>D-253</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) After working hours, foreign workers were confined in
camps under barbed wire enclosures and were carefully guarded.
Dr. Jaeger, senior camp doctor in Krupp’s workers’ camps, has
stated in an affidavit:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The eastern workers and Poles who laboured in the Krupp
works at Essen were kept at camps at Seumannstrasse,
Spenlestrasse, Grieperstrasse, Heegstrasse, Germaniastrasse,
Kapitan-Lehmannstrasse, Dechenschule, and Kramerplatz.
* * * All these camps were surrounded by barbed wire
and were closely guarded.” (<span class='it'>D-288</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) The prisoners of war and foreign laborers at the Krupp
works were undernourished and forced to work on a virtual starvation
diet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) In a memorandum upon Krupp stationery to Mr. Hupe,
Director of the Krupp locomotive factory in Essen, dated 14
March 1942 and entitled “Employment of Russians”, it was
said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“During the last few days we have established that the food
for the Russians employed here is so miserable, that the
people are getting weaker from day to day.</p>

<p>“Investigations showed that single Russians are not able
<span class='pageno' title='794' id='Page_794'></span>
to place a piece of metal for turning into position for instance,
because of lack of physical strength. The same conditions
exist at all places of work where Russians are employed.”
(<span class='it'>D-316</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) In a memorandum dated 18 March 1942, the following was
reported from the Krupp armoured car repair shop:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I got the food this evening after Mr. Balz telephoned, but
I had quite a struggle with the people responsible in the
camp before I got anything at all. They always told me that
the people had already received the day’s rations and there
wasn’t any more. What the gentlemen understand under a
day’s ration is a complete puzzle to me. The food as a whole
was a puzzle too, because they ladled me out the thinnest of
any already watery soup. It was literally water with a handful
of turnips and it looked as if it were washing up water.</p>

<p>“Please tell Mr. Balz again definitely so that the matter is
finally cleared up, that it cannot continue having people
perish here at work.” (<span class='it'>D-310</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) In a memorandum dated 20 March 1942 to Mr. Ihn, one
of the Krupp Directors, Dinkelacker, a Krupp official, wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Deputy Works Manager Mr. Mustin, who also employs
a number of such Russian workers and who is quite satisfied
with their performance, went to the camp in Kramerplatz
on my inducement and had a talk with Mr. Welberg,
the Camp Commandant. Mr. Hassel from the Works Police
who was present at the time, butted in and declared that one
should not believe what the people said. Also that one was
dealing with Bolsheviks and they ought to have beatings
substituted for food.” (<span class='it'>D-318</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>d</span>) In a memorandum dated 26 March 1942, to Mr. Hupe concerning
the use of Russian prisoners of war and civilian workers,
it was reported:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The reason why the Russians are not capable of production
is, in my opinion, that the food which they are given will
never give them the strength for working which you hope
for. The food one day, for instance, consisted of a watery
soup with cabbage leaves and a few pieces of turnip. The
punctual appearance of the food leaves a good deal to be
desired too.” (<span class='it'>D-297</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>e</span>) In a memorandum dated 8 December 1942, Haller, a Krupp
official, wrote:
<span class='pageno' title='795' id='Page_795'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The complaints from our foreign workers about insufficient
food have increased lately. * * *”</p>

<p>“We experienced a very forcible confirmation of these complaints
the other day when we drew the food for the Eastern
workers from the kitchen in Kramerplatz. On 5.12.42 the
midday meal contained unpeeled, whole potatoes which were
not even properly cooked; on 7.12.42, there was soup on
which cabbage leaves floated, the sight of which made me
feel sick.” (<span class='it'>D-366</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>f</span>) Dr. Jaeger, senior camp doctor in the Krupps’ workers’
camps, has stated under oath that not only did the plan for food
distribution to foreign workers call for a very small quantity of
meat every week, but also that they received only contaminated
meats rejected by the health authorities, such as horse or tuberculin
infested meat (<span class='it'>D-288</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) The prisoners of war and foreign workers at the Krupp
factories were forced to live in grossly overcrowded hutted camps
and otherwise were denied adequate shelter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) In a sworn statement, Dr. Jaeger, senior camp doctor of
the Krupp workers’ camps, has stated with respect to the Krupp
camps at which the eastern workers and Poles were kept:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Conditions in all these camps were extremely bad. The camps
were greatly overcrowded. In some camps there were over
twice as many people in a barrack as health conditions permitted.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“Sanitary conditions were exceedingly bad. At Kramerplatz,
where approximately 1,200 eastern workers were crowded
into the rooms of an old school, the sanitary conditions were
atrocious in the extreme. Only 10 children’s toilets were
available for the 1,200 inhabitants. At Dechenschule, 15
children’s toilets were available for the 400-500 eastern
workers. Excretion contaminated the entire floors of these
lavatories. There were also very few facilities for washing.”
(<span class='it'>D-288</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) Statistics upon the Krupp camps compiled by Krupp officials
in 1942 for the Essen health authorities show that in the
Krupp Seumannstrasse camp 1784 beds were compressed into a
surface area of 7844 square meters; in the Krupp Bottroperstrasse
camp 874 beds were crowded into a surface area of 3585
square meters; and that in other Krupp camps the congestion
was even greater (<span class='it'>D-143</span>).
<span class='pageno' title='796' id='Page_796'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) In a memorandum dated 12 June 1944, Dr. Stinnesbeck, a
doctor retained by the Krupp works, reported, with respect to the
Krupp prisoner of war camp at Noggerathstrasse that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“315 prisoners are still accommodated in the camp. 170 of
these are no longer in barracks but in the tunnel in Grunerstrasse
under the Essen-Mulheim railway line. This tunnel
is damp and is not suitable for continued accommodation of
human beings. The rest of the prisoners are accommodated
in 10 different factories in Krupps works.” (<span class='it'>D-335</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>d</span>) In a special medical report marked “strictly confidential”,
dated 2 September 1944, concerning the same prisoner of war
camp, Dr. Jaeger wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The P. O. W. camp in the Noggerathstrasse is in a frightful
condition. The people live in ash bins, dog kennels, old baking
ovens and in self-made huts.” (<span class='it'>D-339</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(3) The prisoners of war and foreign workers at the Krupp
factories were denied adequate clothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) Dr. Jaeger, senior camp doctor in Krupps’ workers’ camps,
has stated under oath:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The clothing of the eastern workers was likewise completely
inadequate. They worked and slept in the same clothing in
which they had arrived from the east. Virtually all of them
had no overcoats and were compelled, therefore, to use their
blankets as coats in cold and rainy weather. In view of the
shortage of shoes, many workers were forced to go to work
in their bare feet, even in the winter. Wooden shoes were
given to some of the workers, but their quality was such as
to give the workers sore feet. Many workers preferred to go
to work in their bare feet rather than endure the suffering
caused by the wooden shoes. Apart from the wooden shoes,
no clothing of any kind was issued to the workers until the
latter part of 1943, when a single blue work suit was issued
to some of them. To my knowledge, this represented the sole
issue of clothing to the workers from the time of their arrival
until the American forces entered Essen.” (<span class='it'>D-288</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) In a memorandum to Mr. Ihn, a Krupp director, dated 20
October 1942, Dr. Wiehle, head of the Krupp hospital in Essen,
wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“It has already been pointed out several times at conferences
that the clothing for Eastern workers, men and women, is
not sufficient. With regard to the cold weather, the camp
<span class='pageno' title='797' id='Page_797'></span>
physician today called our attention to the fact that the number
of colds is going up because of the question of insufficient
clothing.</p>

<p>“Many of the men and women still have to go barefooted.
They have no underwear and it often happens that people
who wear foot bandages because of injuries walk barefooted
on these bandages.” (<span class='it'>D-271</span>; see also <span class='it'>D-355</span>, <span class='it'>D-312</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(4) Prisoners of war and foreign laborers at the Krupp works
were denied adequate medical care and treatment, and as a consequence,
suffered severely from a multitude of diseases and ailments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) In the above mentioned affidavit, Dr. Jaeger has stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The percentage of eastern workers who were ill was twice
as great as among the Germans. Tuberculosis was particularly
widespread among the eastern workers. The T.B. rate
among them was 4 times the normal rate (2% eastern workers,
.5% Germans). At Dechenschule approximately 2½%
of the workers suffered from open T.B. These were all active
T.B. cases. The Tartars and Kirghiz suffered most; as soon
as they were overcome by this disease they collapsed like
flies. The cause was bad housing, the poor quality and insufficient
quantity of food, overwork, and insufficient rest.</p>

<p>“These workers were likewise afflicted with spotted fever.
Lice, the carrier of this disease, together with countless fleas,
bugs and other vermin, tortured the inhabitants of these
camps. As a result of the filthy conditions of the camps
nearly all eastern workers were afflicted with skin disease.
The shortage of food also caused many cases of Hunger-Odem,
Nephritis and Shighakruse.</p>

<p>“It was the general rule that workers were compelled to go
to work unless a camp doctor had prescribed that they were
unfit for work. At Seumannstrasse, Grieperstrasse, Germaniastrasse,
Kapitan-Lehmannstrasse, and Dechenschule,
there was no daily sick call. At these camps, the doctors did
not appear for two or three days. As a consequence, workers
were forced to go to work despite illnesses.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“At the end of 1943, or the beginning of 1944,—I am not
completely sure of the exact date—I obtained permission for
the first time to visit the prisoner of war camps. My inspection
revealed that conditions at these camps were even
<span class='pageno' title='798' id='Page_798'></span>
worse than those I had found at the camps of the eastern
workers in 1942. Medical supplies at such camps were virtually
non-existent. In an effort to cure this intolerable
situation, I contacted the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> authorities whose duty
it was to provide medical care for the prisoners of war. My
persistent efforts came to nothing. After visiting and pressing
them over a period of two weeks, I was given a total of
100 aspirin tablets for over 3,000 prisoners of war.” (<span class='it'>D-288</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) In a memorandum dated 7 May 1943, prepared at the
Krupp hospital, entitled “Deaths of Eastern Workers,” report
was made of the death of 54 “eastern workers.” Of this number,
38 died of tuberculosis, 2 of undernourishment, and 2 of intestinal
disease. (<span class='it'>D-283</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) In his “strictly confidential” report concerning the prisoner
of war camp at Noggerathstrasse, Dr. Jaeger reported:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The food is barely sufficient. Krupp is responsible for housing
and feeding. The supply of medicine and bandages is so
extremely bad that proper medical treatment was not possible
in many cases. This fact is detrimental to the P. W.
camp. It is astonishing that the number of sick is not higher
than it is and it moves between 9 and 10 percent.” (<span class='it'>D-339</span>;
also <span class='it'>D-313</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>d</span>) In a special medical report dated 28 July 1944, Dr. Jaeger
wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The sick barrack in Camp Rabenhorst is in such bad condition,
one cannot speak of a sick barrack anymore. The rain
leaks through in every corner. The housing of the ill is
therefore impossible. The necessary labour for production
is in danger because those persons who are ill cannot recover.

<p class='pindent'>(5) Russian juveniles were compelled to work at the Krupp
factories, and prisoners of war and foreign workers were generally
forced to work long hours, to and beyond the point of
exhaustion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) In a memorandum marked “secret”, dated 14 August 1942,
Reiff, a Krupp official, wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * I am under the impression that the better Russian
workers are first of all chosen for the works in Central and
Eastern Germany. We really get the bad remainders only.
Just now 600 Russians, consisting of 450 women and 150
juveniles, 14 years of age, arrived.” (<span class='it'>D-348</span>; similar proof

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='799' id='Page_799'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) In a memorandum from the Chief of the Krupp Camp
Catering Department, it is stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * It is to be considered that foreigners must work
12 hours on principle out of which, 1 hour counts as a break
and consequently will not be paid.” (<span class='it'>D-233</span>; for evidence
concerning complete exhaustion of foreign workers and prisoners
of war, see <span class='it'>D-313</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(6) The prisoners of war and foreign laborers used at the
Krupp works were beaten, tortured, and subjected to inhuman
indignities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) In a sworn statement, Heinrich Buschhauer has stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * I admit that I hit Russians. The Russians were
very willing and attentive. The clothing of the Russians was
very bad and torn. Their feet were wrapped in rags. The
appearance of the people was bad, they were thin and pale.
Their cheeks had fallen in completely. In spite of this, I
was forced to ill-treat the people on the orders of works manager
Theile. I have boxed the people’s ears and beaten them
with a ¾ rubber tube and a wooden stick. * * * The
more energetic I went against these people, the more the
Works Manager liked it. I * * * had to drive and
beat the Russians in order to get increased production from
them. At times, I had up to two thousand foreigners under
me. The Russians could not possibly work more than they
did, because the food was too bad and too little. The Works
management, however, wanted to get still higher performance
from them. It often happened that the Russians, so
utterly weakened, collapsed. * * *”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The conditions which I have described above continued the
whole of the years I was in the boiler making department.
On 20th February 1943, I was transferred from the boiler
making shop to Nidia.” (<span class='it'>D-305</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) Walter Thoene, a Krupp employee, likewise admitted in a
sworn statement that he constantly beat foreign workers. He
stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I admit that I punched and beat Hungarian Jewesses who
I had to supervise in No. 3 Steel Moulding Shop. I did not
do this of my own free will but was ordered to do so by my
works manager Reif, who was a Party Member like I was.
Almost every day this unscrupulous man held me to it in no
mistakable manner to driving on these Jewesses and getting
<span class='pageno' title='800' id='Page_800'></span>
better performances from them. He also always emphasized
that I should not be trivial in the choice of means, and if
necessary, hit them like hitting a piece of cold iron. As soon
as I saw that these women were standing near the ovens, I
had to drive them back to their work.” (<span class='it'>D-355</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Comparable admission were made by August Kleinschmidt,
another Krupp employee. (<span class='it'>D-306</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) Dr. Apolinary Gotowicki, a doctor in the Polish Army, who
was taken a prisoner of war and in that capacity attended some
Russian, Polish and French prisoners of war at the Krupp factories,
has stated under oath:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * Every day, at least 10 people were brought to
me whose bodies were covered with bruises on account of the
continual beatings with rubber tubes, steel switches or sticks.
The people were often writhing with agony and it was impossible
for me to give them even a little medical aid.
* * * I could notice people daily who on account of hunger
or ill-treatment, were slowly dying. Dead people often
lay for 2 or 3 days on the pailliases until their bodies stank
so badly that fellow prisoners took them outside and buried
them somewhere. * * * I have seen with my own eyes
the prisoners coming back from Krupps and how they collapsed
on the march and had to be wheeled back on barrows
or carried by their comrades. * * * The work which
they had to perform was very heavy and dangerous and
many cases happened where people had cut their fingers,
hands or legs. These accidents were very serious and the
people came to me and asked me for medical help. But it
wasn’t even possible for me to keep them from work for a
day or two, although I had been to the Krupp directorate
and asked for permission to do so. At the end of 1941, 2
people died daily and in 1942 the deaths increased to 3-4
per day.” (<span class='it'>D-313</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>d</span>) A particular form of torture which was inflicted upon
Russian workers was a steel cabinet specially manufactured by
Krupp, into which workers were thrown after beatings. The
cabinets are shown in photographs attached to a sworn statement
wherein it is stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Photograph ‘A’ shows an iron cupboard which was specially
manufactured by the Firm of Krupp to torture Russian
civilian workers to such an extent that it is impossible to
describe. Men and women were often locked in one compartment
of the cupboard, in which a man could scarcely stand,
<span class='pageno' title='801' id='Page_801'></span>
for long periods. The measurements of this compartment
are height 1.52 meters, breadth and depth 40 to 50 cm. each.
In fact, people were often kicked and pressed into one compartment
in pairs. At the top of the cupboard, there were
sieve-like air holes through which cold water was poured
on the unfortunate victims during the ice-cold winter.”
(<span class='it'>D-382</span>; for further evidence of constant beatings of foreign
workers, see <span class='it'>D-253</span>, <span class='it'>D-312</span>, <span class='it'>D-354</span>, and <span class='it'>D-267</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>e</span>) Records found in the Krupp files plainly indicate that the
practice of beating and torturing prisoners of war and foreign
workers was deliberately prescribed by Krupp officials. Steel
switches which were used to beat the workers were distributed
pursuant to the instructions of Kupke, head of the Krupp camps
for foreign workers (<span class='it'>D-230</span>). In a memorandum dated 19 March
1942, from the Krupp Works Catering Department, it was said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * With regards to the times ahead it seems desirable
to us, to draw attention to the authorities concerned,
with the necessary pressure, to the fact that only severest
treatment of the French prisoners of war will ensure that
they maintain their performance even with the present food
position, which is the same for German workers.” (<span class='it'>D-278</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>As previously shown, Hassel, an official in the Krupp works
police, stated that the Russians “ought to have beatings substituted
for food” (<span class='it'>D-318</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(7) The Krupp companies specifically requested and actively
sought out the employment of prisoners of war and foreign
laborers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) In a memorandum dated 13 July 1942 by Weinhold, a
Krupp official, complaint was registered over the fact that “the
foreign laborers are only available two to three months after
they have been asked for by us.” (<span class='it'>D-281</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) In a letter to the Krupp firm dated 27 August 1942,
Colonel Zimmerman of the <span class='it'>Oberkommando des Heeres</span>, said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“According to our estimate, there ought to be enough
workers in your ignitor workshops to reach the demanded
production figure. This especially, as the 105 Russians, demanded
by your firm at the Conference of the special committee
M 111 on the 24.4.42, were assigned to your works at
the beginning of June re-letter from Wa J Ru (Mun. 2).
* * *</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, I found out at the sitting of the special
committee M 111 on the 26.8.42 that the firm of Krupp asks
for another 55 workers, including 25 skilled labourers, without
<span class='pageno' title='802' id='Page_802'></span>
having a corresponding raise in the production figures.
I cannot judge from here, what the reasons for this are.”
(<span class='it'>D-345</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) In a memorandum dated 21 December 1942 concerning the
possibility of the Krupp works obtaining additional conscripted
French workers, Dr. Lehmann, a Krupp official, stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * We discussed how far it would be possible for
complete shifts of workers conscripted from French factories
to be transferred to Essen. We are to collaborate as far as
practicable in the splitting up of our requirements amongst
individual military government offices and military police
posts. So far as possible one of our representatives is to
assist in the selection from amongst the conscripts.” (<span class='it'>D-196</span>;
see also <span class='it'>D-280</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(8) Concentration camp laborers, who were brought to the
Krupp works at the request of Krupp officials, were subjected to
persecution, degradation, despoilment, and torture in a manner
similar to that of prisoners of war and slave laborers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) Mr. Ihn, a director of the Krupp firm, has stated in a
signed but unsworn statement, that the Krupp firm first asked
for concentration camp labor on 22 September 1942, and that
the first group of them arrived “in the summer or autumn of
1944” (<span class='it'>D-274</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) The fact that concentration camp labor was requested by
the Krupp works; that such persons were to be confined behind
barbed wire enclosures; and that they were to be closely guarded
by SS personnel is further shown in a memorandum entitled
“Visit of the Director of Distribution of Workers of the Weimar-Buchenwald
Concentration Camp; SS Hauptsturmfuehrer
Schwarz on 26-7-44”, written by Trockel, a Krupp official. In
the course of this memorandum, Trockel stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Herr Schwarz came on behalf of his Commandant SS
Standartenfuehrer Pister to talk over with us, the question
of employment of K1 detainees. He pointed out that the employment
of men could not be reckoned with for a considerable
period. Our last request was for 700 women.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“As not less than 500 women would be assigned, we agreed
that the figure should remain at 500 women in order that the
assignment should not be endangered. * * *”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“* * * The main things are the erection of a barbed
<span class='pageno' title='803' id='Page_803'></span>
wire fence in front of the hall which allows a small exit and
the erection of a small barracks for the Commander of the
guard and his duty office and for the German female guard
personnel. * * *”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The SS are providing a guard consisting of guard commander
and 10 men. For 520 women we have to name approx.
45 German women who will be sworn in to the SS,
given 3 weeks training in the women’s camp at Ravensbrueck
and then given full official supervision duties by the
SS. * * *” (<span class='it'>D-238</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) Dr. Jaeger, senior camp doctor in the Krupp camps, has
described conditions at the camp which the Krupp works maintained
for concentration camp labor as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Camp Humboldtstrasse had been inhabited by Italian prisoners
of war. After it had been destroyed by an air raid, the
Italians were removed and 600 Jewish females from Buchenwald
Concentration Camp were brought in to work at the
Krupp factories. Upon my first visit at Camp Humboldtstrasse,
I found these females suffering from open festering
wounds and other diseases.</p>

<p>“I was the first doctor they had seen for at least a fortnight.
There was no doctor in attendance at the camp. There were
no medical supplies in the camp. They had no shoes and went
about in their bare feet. The sole clothing of each consisted
of a sack with holes for their arms and head. Their hair
was shorn. The camp was surrounded by barbed wire and
closely guarded by SS guards.</p>

<p>“The amount of food in the camp was extremely meagre and
of very poor quality. The houses in which they lived consisted
of the ruins of former barracks and they afforded no
shelter against rain and other weather conditions. I reported
to my superiors that the guards lived and slept outside
their barracks as one could not enter them without
being attacked by 10, 20 and up to 30 fleas. One camp doctor
employed by me refused to enter the camp again after he had
been bitten very badly. I visited this camp with a Mr. Grono
on two occasions and both times we left the camp badly bitten.
We had great difficulty in getting rid of the fleas and
insects which had attacked us. As a result of this attack by
insects of this camp, I got large boils on my arms and the
rest of my body. I asked my superiors at the Krupp works
<span class='pageno' title='804' id='Page_804'></span>
to undertake the necessary steps to delouse the camp so as to
put an end to this unbearable, vermin-infested condition.
Despite this report, I did not find any improvement in sanitary
conditions at the camp on my second visit a fortnight
later.” (<span class='it'>D-288</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>d</span>) The conditions under which the concentration camp workers
existed at the Krupp camps and factories and the indignities
and barbarities to which they were subjected are vividly described
in affidavits by such workers (<span class='it'>D-256</span>; <span class='it'>D-277</span>; <span class='it'>D-272</span>).
In general, the affidavits disclose that these concentration camp
laborers slept on bare floors of damp, windowless and lightless
cellars; that they had no water for drinking or cleansing purposes;
that they were compelled to do work far beyond their
strength; that they were mercilessly beaten; that they were given
one wretched meal a day, consisting of a dirty watery soup with
a thin slice of black bread; and that many of them died from
starvation, tuberculosis and overexertion. A chart entitled “Fried.
Krupp <span class='it'>Berthawerk, Markstaedt</span> Breslau, Number of Occupied
Foreigners, Prisoners of War and Concentration Camp Inmates”
shows the use of concentration camp labor at that factory, as well
as at the above-mentioned Krupp company in Essen (<span class='it'>D-298</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(9) Charts prepared by Krupp officials show that in September
1943, the Krupp concerns employed 39,245 foreign workers and
11,224 prisoners of war, and that the number mounted steadily
until September 1944, when 54,990 foreign workers and 18,902
prisoners of war were used (Chart entitled “Foreigners and
Prisoners of War of the Krupp Concern”; chart entitled “Cast
Steel Works, Number of Prisoners of War and Foreigners”, not
here reproduced.) The majority of the foreign laborers consisted
of Russians, French, Poles, and Dutch.</p>

<h3>I. <span class='it'>AS REWARD FOR HIS PARTICIPATION IN THE NAZI CONSPIRATORS’ PROGRAM, KRUPP REAPED LARGE PROFITS, WAS PERMITTED TO EXPAND HIS INDUSTRIAL EMPIRE, AND RECEIVED HIGH HONORS AND SPECIAL PRIVILEGES FROM THE NAZI GOVERNMENT.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(1) Although the Krupp companies operated at a substantial
loss in the years immediately preceding Hitler’s accession to
power, the huge orders from the Nazi state enabled them to derive
vast profits thereafter. In the fiscal year 1 October 1934 to
30 September 1935, the net profits of Fried. Krupp and subsidiaries,
after the deduction of taxes, gifts and reserves recognized
<span class='pageno' title='805' id='Page_805'></span>
by the tax authorities, amounted to 57,216,392 marks. In
the fiscal year 1937 to 1938 these net profits rose to 97,071,632
marks, and in the fiscal year 1941 they amounted to 111,555,216
marks (Chart entitled “Income and Loss of the Fried. Krupp
Combine”; Graph entitled “Profits or Losses of Fried. Krupp
and Subsidiaries as Reported to Tax Authorities,” not here reproduced.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) Krupp was permitted, with the approval and at times
connivance of Nazi officials, to extend in great measure his participation
in other companies, both within and without Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) On 1 October 1933 the participations of Fried. Krupp in
other concerns had a book value of 75,962,000 marks. By 30
September 1942 the book value of the participations had grown
to 132,944,000 marks. On 1 October 1942 the participation
account was revalued and carried at a new figure of 187,924,621
marks. In the following year new acquisitions were made in
the amount of 50,224,707 marks, so that the book value of the
participations as of 1 October 1943 was 237,316,093 marks.
Even this figure contains many going concerns in occupied countries
which were arbitrarily assigned a book value of only 1
mark. Leaving out of account the revaluation of 1 October 1942,
the participation account as of 1 October 1943 would have been
182,952,000 marks. The increment in the participation account
is shown in a chart entitled, “Fried. Krupp Participations”
(<span class='it'>D-341</span>). The expansion of the Krupp concern under the Nazi
regime is likewise revealed by a comparison of charts showing
the companies in the Krupp concern as of 30 September 1935
and 31 January 1944.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) Complete records of all acquisitions by Krupp have not
been obtained because, according to Krupp officials, many
records were lost or destroyed in air raids. Enough appears,
however, to indicate that the Krupp firm did in fact call upon
the Nazi authorities to facilitate or make possible the acquisition
of property interests in occupied countries. Thus, when Mr.
Erhard, the French custodian of Jewish property in France,
resisted Krupp’s attempts to acquire a lease of a plant at Liancourt,
France, the Krupp concern enlisted the support of the
Army to gain its objective. Under threat of replacement by a
German official, the French custodian of Jewish property acceded
to Krupp’s demands. In a memorandum dated 29 July 1942,
found in the Krupp files, it is stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * M. Erhard delayed the negotiations to such an
extent that finally the appropriate military authorities in
<span class='pageno' title='806' id='Page_806'></span>
Paris urged a settlement. This authority declared that if
Mr. Erhard could not make up his mind to sell, at least he
would have to give a three years’ lease to Krupp.</p>

<p>“The custodianship would be taken away from Mr. Erhard
and a German Commissar would be appointed unless the
lease were granted in a very short time.” (<span class='it'>D-526</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(3) In recognition of his services to the Nazi State, Krupp
was awarded the “Shield of the Eagle of the German Reich”
with the inscription “To the German leader of Industry” (<span class='it'>D-66</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) Because of his unique service to the military power of the
Nazi State, Krupp was authorized by special decree of Hitler to
transform Fried. Krupp A.G. into a private family concern in
order to perpetuate control of the firm by a single member of
the Krupp family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) In a letter dated 11 November 1942 to Bormann, Krupp
stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * You have asked me to make proposals to you
which would secure the future of the unified existence of the
Krupp works more than this is feasible today. * * *
On considering this question we have ascertained that
under the present laws the principal solution of the question
cannot be carried out. We had to find an entirely new
way, therefore, which, just as the law regarding heritage of
agricultural property, creates entirely new legislation.”
(<span class='it'>D-99</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) In reply to the above letter, Bormann wrote to Krupp
that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I have reported the contents of your letters of the 11/11
to the Fuehrer today. He instructed me to inform you that
he would be readily prepared to arrange for any possible
safeguarding for the continued existence of the works as a
family enterprise; it would be the simplest to issue a ‘<span class='it'>Lex
Krupp</span>’ to start with.” (<span class='it'>D-101</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) Krupp’s recognition of the unusual character of his proposal
is indicated in his letter of 24 February 1943 to Lammers,
wherein he said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Without doubt, the matter, which is without precedent
in economic life, will have to be discussed with the Reichs
Minister of Justice and the Reichs Minister of Finance also.
* * *” (<span class='it'>D-106</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>d</span>) On 12 November 1943 Hitler signed the decree making
possible the preservation of the Krupp firm as a family enterprise
in recognition of the fact that
<span class='pageno' title='807' id='Page_807'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“for 132 years the firm of Fried. Krupp, as a family enterprise
has achieved outstanding and unique merits for the
armed strength of the German people.” (<span class='it'>D-120</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>In a letter dated 16 November 1943, Lammers wrote to Krupp:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“On 12 November the Fuehrer signed the decree regarding

with this recognition by the Fuehrer.” (<span class='it'>D-124</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>e</span>) As the final step in the proceeding, Hitler approved “the
statute of the family enterprise Fried. Krupp” which gave effect
to his decree of 12 November 1943 (<span class='it'>D-131</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>f</span>) In a letter of gratitude to Hitler dated 29 December 1943,
Krupp stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * By this, you have made a wish come true, which
my wife and I had had for years, and thus relieved our hearts
of great worry over the future of the Krupp works.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“My wife and I, as well as the whole family, are deeply
grateful to you for this proof of your confidence. * * *”</p>

<p>“Our special thanks go to you, Mein Fuehrer, also for the
great honour and recognition which you have awarded, in
the introduction to your decree, to 130 years of the work of
Krupps, the work of Krupps done by many generations of
faithful followers, and steered and directed by 4 generations
of the family Krupp.” (<span class='it'>D-135</span>)</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='pageno' title='815' id='Page_815'></span>14. KARL DOENITZ</h2>

<h3>A. <span class='it'>NAVAL AND POLITICAL CAREER.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>After his appointment in 1935 as commander of the Weddigen
U-boat flotilla—the first flotilla to be formed after the World
War in 1918—Doenitz, who thus became in effect commander of
U-boats, rose steadily in rank as the U-boat arm expanded until
he became an admiral. On 30 January 1943 he was appointed
Grand Admiral and succeeded Raeder as Commander-in-Chief
of the German Navy, retaining his command of the U-boat arm.
Then, on 1 May 1945, he succeeded Hitler as leader of Germany
(<span class='it'>2887-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doenitz was awarded the following decorations: On 18 September
1939 he received the Cluster of the Iron Cross, first class, for
the U-boat successes in the Baltic during the Polish campaign.
This award was followed on 21 April 1940 by the high award of
the Knight’s Cross to the Iron Cross, while on 7 April 1943 he
received personally from Hitler the Oak Leaf to the Knight’s
Cross of the Iron Cross, as the 223rd recipient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doenitz’s services in building up the German Navy, and in particular
the offensive U-boat arm for the coming war, were outstanding.
An extract from the official publication “<span class='it'>Das Archiv</span>”
on the occasion of Doenitz’s promotion to vice-admiral, dated 27
September 1940, reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * In four years of untiring and in the fullest sense
of the word uninterrupted work of training, he [Doenitz]
succeeds in developing the young U-boat arm, personnel, and
material till it is a weapon of a striking power unexpected
even by the experts. More than three million gross tons of
sunken enemy shipping in only one year achieved with only
few boats speak better than words of the services of this
man.” (<span class='it'>D-436</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>An extract from the diary for the German Navy, 1944 edition
(<span class='it'>1463-PS</span>) emphasizes Doenitz’s contribution. It describes in detail
Doenitz’s work in building up the U-boat arm; his ceaseless
work in training night and day to close the gap of seventeen
years, during which no training had taken place; his responsibility
for new improvements and for devising the “pack” tactics
which were later to become famous. His position is summarized
further as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * In spite of the fact that his duties took on unmeasurable
proportions since the beginning of the huge
U-boat construction program, the chief was what he always
<span class='pageno' title='816' id='Page_816'></span>
was and always will be, leader and inspiration to all the forces
under him. * * * In spite of all his duties, he never
lost touch with his men and he showed a masterly understanding
in adjusting himself to the changing fortunes of
war.” (<span class='it'>1463-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It was not only, however, his ability as a naval officer which
won Doenitz these high honors: his promotion to succeed Raeder
as Commander-in-Chief of the Navy; the personal position he
acquired as one of Hitler’s principal advisers; and finally, earlier
candidates such as Goering having betrayed Hitler’s trust or finding
the position less attractive than they had anticipated, the
doubtful honour of becoming Hitler’s successor. These he owed,
to his fanatical adherence to Hitler and to the Party, to his belief
in the Nazi ideology with which he sought to indoctrinate
the Navy and the German people, and to his “masterly understanding
in adjusting himself to the changing fortunes of war”
(<span class='it'>1463-PS</span>), which may be regarded as synonymous with a capacity
for utter ruthlessness.</p>

<h3>B. <span class='it'>INDOCTRINATION OF NAVAL PERSONNEL WITH NAZI POLITICAL IDEOLOGY.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Doenitz’s attitude to the Nazi Party and its creed is shown by
his public utterances. In a speech—subsequently circulated by
Doenitz as a Top Secret document for senior officers only and by
the hand of officers only—at a meeting of commanders of the
Navy in Weimar on 17 December 1943, Doenitz stated (<span class='it'>D-443</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * I am a firm adherent of the idea of ideological
education. For what is it in the main? Doing his duty is a
matter of course for the soldier. But the whole importance,
the whole weight of duty done, are only present when the
heart and spiritual conviction have a voice in the matter. The
result of duty done is then quite different to what it would be
if I only carried out my task literally, obediently, and faithfully.
It is therefore necessary for the soldier to support the
execution of his duty with all his mental, all his spiritual energy,
and for this his conviction, his ideology are indispensable.
It is therefore necessary for us to train the soldier uniformly,
comprehensively, that he may be adjusted ideologically
to our Germany. Every dualism, every dissension in
this connection, or every divergence, or unpreparedness, imply
a weakness in all circumstances. He in whom this grows
and thrives in unison is superior to the other. Then indeed
the whole importance, the whole weight of his conviction
<span class='pageno' title='817' id='Page_817'></span>
comes into play. It is also nonsense to say that the soldier
or the officer must have no politics. The soldier embodies the
state in which he lives; he is the representative, the articulate
exponent of this state. He must therefore stand with
his whole weight behind this state.</p>

<p>“We must travel this road from our deepest conviction. The
Russian travels along it. We can only maintain ourselves in
this war if we take part in it with holy zeal, with all our
fanaticism.</p>

<p>“Not I alone can do this, but it can only be done with the aid
of the man who holds the production of Europe in his hand,
with Minister Speer. My ambition is to have as many warships
for the Navy as possible so as to be able to fight and to
strike. It does not matter to me who builds them.” (<span class='it'>D-443</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In a speech on the same subject by Doenitz as Commander-in-Chief
of the Navy to the Commanders in Chief on 15 February
1944, he had this to say:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“From the very start the whole of the officer corps must be so
indoctrinated that it feels itself co-responsible for the National
Socialist State in its entirety. The officer is the exponent
of the state; the idle chatter that the officer is non-political
is sheer nonsense.” (<span class='it'>D-640</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Doenitz’s position was made unmistakably clear in a speech
which he made to the German Navy and the German people on
Heroes’ Day, 12 March 1944:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“German men and women!</p>

<p>“* * * What would have become of our country today, if
the Fuehrer had not united us under National-Socialism!
Split into parties, beset with the spreading poison of Jewry
and vulnerable to it, and lacking, as a defense, our present
uncompromising world outlook, we would long since have
succumbed to the burdens of this war and been subject to
the merciless destruction of our adversaries. * * *”
(<span class='it'>2878-PS</span>) A speech by Doenitz to the Navy on 21 July
1944 shows his fanaticism:</p>

<p>“Men of the Navy! Holy wrath and unlimited anger fill our
hearts because of the criminal attempt which was intended
to have cost the life of our beloved Fuehrer. Providence
wished it otherwise—watched over and protected our
Fuehrer, and did not abandon our German fatherland in
the fight for its destiny.” (<span class='it'>2878-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='818' id='Page_818'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>And then he goes on to deal with the fate which should be meted
out to the traitors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The abolition of the German military salute and the adoption
of the Nazi salute in the German forces was due to Doenitz along
with Goering and Keitel (<span class='it'>2878-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Adolf Hitler was reported dead, Doenitz spoke over the
German radio announcing the Fuehrer’s death and his own succession.
The German announcer made this statement:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“It has been reported from the Fuehrer’s Headquarters that
our Fuehrer Adolf Hitler has died this afternoon in his battle
headquarters at the Reichschancellery fighting to the last
breath for Germany against Bolshevism.</p>

<p>“On the 30th April the Fuehrer nominated Grand Admiral
Doenitz to be his successor. The Grand Admiral and Fuehrer’s
successor will speak to the German nation.” (<span class='it'>D-444</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Whereupon Doenitz spoke as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“German men and women, soldiers of the German Armed
Forces. Our Fuehrer Adolf Hitler is dead. The German
people bow in deepest sorrow and respect. Early he had
recognized the terrible danger of Bolshevism and had dedicated
his life to the fight against it. His fight having ended,
he died a hero’s death in the capital of the German Reich,
after having led an unmistakably straight and steady life.”
(<span class='it'>D-444</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Doenitz proceeded to issue an order of the day, to the same
effect (<span class='it'>D-444</span>).</p>

<h3>C. <span class='it'>PARTICIPATION IN PLANNING AND EXECUTION OF AGGRESSIVE WARS.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Apart from his services in building up the U-boat arm, there
is ample evidence that Doenitz, as Officer Commanding U-boats,
took part in the planning and execution of the aggressive wars
against Poland, Norway, and Denmark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Poland.</span> The distribution list on a memorandum by
Raeder, dated 16 May 1939, shows that the sixth copy went to the
<span class='it'>Fuehrer der Unterseeboote</span>, who was Doenitz. This document
was a directive for the invasion of Poland (<span class='it'>Fall Weiss</span>) (<span class='it'>C-126</span>).
Another memorandum from Raeder’s headquarters, dated
2 August 1939, is addressed to the fleet, and The Flag Officer, U-boats—this
is, Doenitz (<span class='it'>C-126</span>). This was merely a covering
letter on operational directions for the precautionary employment
of U-boats in the Atlantic in the event that the intention to
<span class='pageno' title='819' id='Page_819'></span>
carry out <span class='it'>Fall Weiss</span> remained unchanged. The second sentence
is significant:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Flag Officer, U-boats, is handing in his operational orders
to SKL [<span class='it'>Seekriegsleitung</span>, the German Admiralty] by 12 August.
A decision on the sailings of U-boats for the Atlantic
will probably be made at the middle of August.” (<span class='it'>C-126</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Doenitz proceeded to give operational instructions to his U-boats
for the operation <span class='it'>Fall Weiss</span>. These instructions, signed by him,
are not dated, but it is clear from the subject matter that the
date must have been before 16 July 1939 (<span class='it'>C-172</span>). These operational
instructions gave effect to Raeder’s directive (<span class='it'>C-126</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Norway and Denmark.</span> An extract from the War Diary
of the Naval War Staff of the German Admiralty, dated 3 October
1939, records the fact that the Chief of the Naval War Staff
has called for views on the possibility of taking operational bases
in Norway (<span class='it'>C-122</span>). It states Doenitz’s views as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * Flag Officer U-boats already considers such harbors
extremely useful as equipment—and supply—bases for
Atlantic U-boats to call at temporarily.” (<span class='it'>C-122</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A communication from Doenitz as Flag Officer U-boats, addressed
to the Supreme Command of the Navy (the Naval War
Staff) dated 9 October 1939, sets out Doenitz’s views on the
advantages of Trondheim and Narvik as bases. Doenitz proposes
the establishment of a base at Trondheim with Narvik as
an alternative (<span class='it'>C-5</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doenitz then gave operation orders to his U-boats for the occupation
of Denmark and Norway. This Top Secret order, dated
30 March 1940, under the code name “<span class='it'>Hartmut</span>,” provided:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The naval force will, as they enter the harbor, fly the
British flag until the troops have landed, except presumably
at Narvik.” (<span class='it'>C-151</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>England.</span> The preparations for war against England are
perhaps best shown by the disposition of the U-boats under
Doenitz’s command on 3 September 1939, when war broke out
between Germany and the Western Allies. The locations of the
sinkings in the following week, including that of the <span class='it'>Athenia</span>,
provide corroboration. These matters are contained in two
charts prepared by the British Admiralty. The first chart sets
out the disposition of German submarines on 3 September 1939.
The certificate attached to this chart reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“This chart has been constructed from a study of the orders
issued by Doenitz between 21 August 1939 and 3 September
<span class='pageno' title='820' id='Page_820'></span>
1939, and subsequently captured. The chart shows the
approximate disposition of submarines ordered for the 3rd
of September 1939, and cannot be guaranteed accurate in
every detail, as the file of captured orders are clearly not
complete and some of the submarines shown apparently had
received orders at sea on or about September 3 to move to
new operational areas. The documents from which this chart
was constructed are held by the British Admiralty in London.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>It will be apparent that U-boats which were in the positions indicated
on this chart on 3 September 1939 had left Kiel a considerable
time before. The location of the U-boat U-30 is particularly
significant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second chart sets out the sinkings during the first week
of the war. The attached certificate reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“This chart has been constructed from the official records
of the British Admiralty in London. It shows the position
and sinkings of the British merchant vessels lost by enemy
action in the seven days subsequent to 3 September 1939.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The location of the sinking of the <span class='it'>Athenia</span> is significant.</p>

<h3>D. <span class='it'>PARTICIPATION IN CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT VIOLATIONS OF RULES OF WARFARE.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>The course of the war waged against neutral and allied merchant
shipping by German U-boats followed, under Doenitz’s
direction, a course of consistently increasing ruthlessness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Attacks on Merchant Shipping.</span> Doenitz displayed “his
masterly understanding in adjusting himself to the changing
fortunes of war” (<span class='it'>1463-PS</span>). From the very early days, merchant
ships, both allied and neutral, were sunk without warning,
and when operational danger zones had been announced by the
German Admiralty, these sinkings continued to take place both
within and without those zones. With some exceptions in the
early days of the war, no regard was taken for the safety of the
crews or passengers of sunken merchant ships, and the announcement
claiming a total blockade of the British Isles merely served
to confirm the established situation under which U-boat warfare
was being conducted without regard to the established rules of
international warfare or the requirements of humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The course of the war at sea during the first eighteen months
is summarized by two official British reports made at a time
when those who compiled them were ignorant of some of the
<span class='pageno' title='821' id='Page_821'></span>
actual orders issued which have since come to hand. An official
report of the British Foreign Office summarizes German attacks
on merchant shipping during the period 3 September 1939 to September
1940, that is to say, the first year of the war (<span class='it'>D-641-A</span>).
This report, made shortly after September 1940, states in part
as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * During the first twelve months of the war, 2,081,062
tons of Allied shipping, comprising 508 ships, have been
lost by enemy action. In addition, 769,213 tons of neutral
shipping comprising 253 ships, have also been lost. Nearly
all these merchant ships have been sunk by submarine, mine,
aircraft or surface craft, and the great majority of them
sunk while engaged on their lawful trading occasions. 2,836
Allied merchant seamen have lost their lives in these ships.</p>

<p>“In the last war the practice of the Central Powers was so
remote from the recognized procedure that it was thought
necessary to set forth once again the rules of warfare in
particular as applied to submarines. This was done in the
Treaty of London 1930, and in 1936 Germany acceded to
these rules. The rules laid down:</p>

<p>“(1) In action with regard to merchant ships, submarines
must conform to the rules of International Law to which surface
vessels are subjected.</p>

<p>“(2) In particular, except in the case of persistent refusal
to stop on being summoned, or of active resistance to visit
and search, a warship, whether surface vessel or submarine,
may not sink or render incapable of navigation a merchant
vessel without having first placed passengers, crew, and
ship’s papers in a place of safety. For this purpose, the ship’s
boats are not regarded as a place of safety unless the safety
of the passengers and crew is assured in the existing sea and
weather conditions, by the proximity of land, or the presence
of another vessel which is in a position to take them on board.</p>

<p>“At the beginning of the present war, Germany issued a
Prize Ordinance for the regulation of sea warfare and the
guidance of her naval officers. Article 74 of this ordinance
embodies the submarine rules of the London Treaty. Article
72, however, provides that captured enemy vessels may be
destroyed if it seems inexpedient or unsafe to bring them
into port, and Article 73 (i) (ii) makes the same provision
with regard to neutral vessels which are captured for sailing
under enemy convoy, for forcible resistance, or for giving
assistance to the enemy. These provisions are certainly not
<span class='pageno' title='822' id='Page_822'></span>
in accordance with the traditional British view but the important
point is that, even in these cases, the Prize Ordinance
envisages the capture of the merchantman before its destruction.
In other words, if the Germans adhered to the rules set
out in their own Prize Ordinance, we might have argued the
rather fine legal point with them, but we should have no
quarrel with them, either on the broader legal issue or on
the humanitarian one. In the event, however, it is only too
clear that almost from the beginning of the war the Germans
abandoned their own principles and waged war with steadily
increasing disregard for International Law, and for what is,
after all, the ultimate sanction of all law, the protection of
human life and property from arbitrary and ruthless attacks.”
(<span class='it'>D-641-A</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Two instances are then set out:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“On the 30th of September, 1939, came the first sinking of
a neutral ship by a submarine without warning and with loss
of life. This was the Danish ship ‘<span class='it'>Vendia</span>’ bound for the
Clyde in ballast. The submarine fired two shots and shortly
after torpedoed the ship. The torpedo was fired when the
master had already signalled that he would submit to the
submarine’s orders and before there had been an opportunity
to abandon ship. By November submarines were beginning
to sink neutral vessels without warning as a regular thing.
On the 12th November the Norwegian ‘<span class='it'>Arne Kjode</span>’ was torpedoed
in the North Sea without any warning at all. This
was a tanker bound from one neutral port to another. The
master and four of the crew lost their lives and the remainder
were picked up after many hours in open boats. Henceforward,
in addition to the failure to establish the nature of
the cargo, another element is noticeable, namely an increasing
recklessness as to the fate of the crew.” (<span class='it'>D-641-A</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>And then, dealing with attacks on allied merchant vessels, certain
figures are given:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<table id='tab58' summary='' class='center'>
<colgroup>
<col span='1' style='width: 10em;'/>
<col span='1' style='width: 10em;'/>

<tr><td class='tab58c1 tdStyle1'>“Illegal attacks</td><td class='tab58c2 tdStyle1'>112</td></tr>
</table>
<p>“At least 79 of these 112 ships were torpedoed without warning.”
(<span class='it'>D-641-A</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>The report continues:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“By the middle of October submarines were sinking merchant
vessels without any regard to the safety of the crews.
Yet four months later the Germans were still officially claiming
<span class='pageno' title='823' id='Page_823'></span>
that they were acting in accordance with the Prize Ordinance.
Their own semi-official commentators however, had
made the position clearer. As regards neutrals, Berlin officials
had early in February stated that any neutral ship that
is either voluntarily or under compulsion bound for an enemy
port—including contraband control harbours—thereby loses
its neutrality and must be considered hostile. At the end of
February the cat was let out of the bag by a statement that
a neutral ship which obtained a navicert from a British Consul
in order to avoid putting into a British contraband control
base was liable to be sunk by German submarines, even
if it was bound from one neutral port to another. As regards
Allied ships, in the middle of November 1939 a Berlin warning
was issued against the arming of British vessels. By
that date a score of British merchantmen had been illegally
attacked by gunfire or torpedo from submarines, and after
that date some fifteen more unarmed Allied vessels were
torpedoed without warning. It is clear, therefore, that not
only was the arming fully justified as a defensive measure,
but also that neither before nor after this German threat did
the German submarines discriminate between armed and unarmed
vessels.” (<span class='it'>D-641-A</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A similar report covering the next six months (<span class='it'>D-641-B</span>)
makes these statements:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“On the 30th January 1941, Hitler proclaimed that ‘every
ship, with or without convoy, which appears before our torpedo
tubes is going to be torpedoed.’ On the face of it, this
announcement appears to be uncompromising; and the only
qualification provided by the context is that the threats immediately
preceding it are specifically addressed to the peoples
of the American Continent. German commentators, however,
subsequently tried to water it down by contending that
Hitler was referring only to ships which attempted to enter
the area within which the German ‘total blockade’ is alleged
to be in force.</p>

<p>“From one point of view it probably matters little what exactly
was Hitler’s meaning, since the only conclusion that
can be reached after a study of the facts of enemy warfare
on merchant shipping is that enemy action in this field is
never limited by the principles which are proclaimed by
enemy spokesmen, but solely by the opportunities or lack of
them which exist at any given time.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The effect of the German total blockade is to prohibit neutral
<span class='pageno' title='824' id='Page_824'></span>
ships from entering an enormous stretch of sea round Britain
(the area extends to about 500 miles west of Ireland, and
from the latitude of Bordeaux to that of the Faroe Islands),
upon pain of having their ships sunk without warning and
their crews killed. As a matter of fact, at least thirty-two
neutral ships, exclusive of those sailing in British convoys,
have been sunk by enemy action since the declaration of the
‘total blockade’.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“Yet, though information is lacking in very many cases, details
are available to prove that, during the period under review,
at least thirty-eight Allied merchant ships, exclusive
of those in convoys, have been torpedoed without warning in
or near the ‘total blockade’ area.</p>

<p>“That the Germans themselves have no exaggerated regard
for the area is proved by the fact that of the thirty-eight
ships referred to at least sixteen were torpedoed outside the
limits of the war-zone.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The sinking of the ‘<span class='it'>City of Benares</span>’ on the 17th September
1940 is a good example of this. The ‘<span class='it'>City of Benares</span>’ was an
11,000-ton liner with 191 passengers on board, including
nearly 100 children. She was torpedoed without warning just
outside the ‘war zone,’ with the loss of 258 lives, including 77
children. It was blowing a gale, with hail and rain squalls
and a very rough sea when the torpedo struck her at about
10 p. m. In the darkness and owing to the prevailing weather
conditions, at least four of the twelve boats lowered were
capsized. Others were swamped and many people were
washed right out of them. In one boat alone sixteen people,
including 11 children, died from exposure; in another 22 died,
including 15 children; in a third 21 died. The point to be
emphasized is not the unusual brutality of this attack but
rather that such results are inevitable when a belligerent
disregards the rules of sea warfare as the Germans have done
and are doing.”</p>

<p>“There are hundreds of similar stories, stories of voyages
for days in open boats in Atlantic gales, of men in the water
clinging for hours to a raft and gradually dropping off one
by one, of crews being machine-gunned as they tried to lower
their boats or as they drifted away in them, of seamen being
blown to pieces by shells and torpedoes and bombs. The
enemy must know that such things are the inevitable result
of the type of warfare he has chosen to employ.” (<span class='it'>D-641-B</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='825' id='Page_825'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The total sinkings by U-boats during the war (1939 to 1945)
amounted to 2,775 British, Allied, and Neutral ships totalling
14,572,435 gross tons (<span class='it'>D-641-C</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another example of the ruthless nature of the actions conducted
by Doenitz’s U-boat commanders, particularly as both British and
German versions of the sinking are available, is the sinking of
“<span class='it'>S. S. Sheaf Mead</span>.” The British report, which includes the German
account in the shape of a complete extract from the U-boat’s
log, states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The British ‘<span class='it'>S. S. Sheaf Mead</span>’ was torpedoed without warning
on 27 May 1940 with the loss of 31 of the crew. The
commander of the U-boat responsible is reported to have
behaved in an exceptionally callous manner towards the men
clinging to upturned boats and pieces of wood. It was thought
that this man was Kapitaenleutnant Oehrn of U-37. The following
extract from his diary for 27 May 1940 leaves no
doubt on the matter and speaks for itself as to his behaviour.”
(<span class='it'>D-644</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The relevant extract from the log, at 1554 hours, reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Surface. Stern [referring to the ship which has been torpedoed]
is underwater. Bows rise higher. The boats are
now on the water. Lucky for them. A picture of complete
order. They lie at some distance. The bows rear up quite
high. Two men appear from somewhere in the forward part
of the ship. They leap and rush with great bounds along the
deck down to the stern. The stern disappears. A boat capsizes.
Then a boiler explosion. Two men fly through the
air, limbs outstretched. Bursting and crashing. Then all
is over. A large heap of wreckage floats up. We approach
it to identify the name. The crew have saved themselves on
wreckage. We fish out a buoy. No name on it. I ask a man
on the raft. He says, hardly turning his head—‘Nix Name.’
A young boy in the water calls ‘Help, help, please.’ The others
are very composed. They look damp and somewhat tired.
An expression of cold hatred is on their faces. On to the old
course. After washing the paint off the buoy, the name
comes to light: Greatafield, Glasgow. 5006 gross registered
tons.” (<span class='it'>D-644</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>“On to the old course” means merely that the U-boat makes off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The report of the Chief Engineer of the “<span class='it'>S. S. Sheaf Mead</span>”
contains this description of the situation:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“When I came to the surface I found myself on the port side,
that is, nearest to the submarine, which was only about five
<span class='pageno' title='826' id='Page_826'></span>
yards away. The submarine Captain asked the steward the
name of the ship, which he told him, and the enemy picked
up one of our lifebuoys, but this had the name ‘<span class='it'>Gretaston</span>’
on it, as this was the name of our ship before it was changed
to ‘<span class='it'>Sheaf Mead</span>’ last January.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“She had cutaway bows, but I did not notice a net cutter.
Two men stood at the side with boat hooks to keep us off.</p>

<p>“They cruised around for half an hour, taking photographs
of us in the water. Otherwise they just watched us, but said
nothing. Then she submerged and went off, without offering
us any assistance whatever.” (<span class='it'>D-644</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The U-boats log at 1444 hours contains a description of the
sighting of the ship, the difficulty in identification, and then the
sinking:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The distance apart is narrowing. The steamship draws in
quickly, but the position is still 40-50. I cannot see the stern
yet. Tube ready. Shall I or not? The gunnery crews are
also prepared. On the ship’s side a yellow cross in a small,
square, dark blue ground. Swedish? Presumably not. I
raise the periscope a little. Hurrah, a gun at the stern, an
ack-ack gun or something similar. Fire! I cannot miss.”
(<span class='it'>D-644</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The actual documents by which Doenitz and his fellow conspirators
issued their orders in disregard of International Law
indicate that the compiler of the above reports understated the
case. These orders cover not only the period referred to in the
above reports, but also the subsequent course of the war. It is
interesting to note in them the steps by which the conspirators
progressed. At first they were content with breaching the rules
of International Law to the extent of sinking merchant ships,
including neutral ships, without warning where there was a reasonable
prospect of being able to do so without discovery. The
facts already quoted show that the question of whether ships
were defensively armed or outside the declared operational areas
was in practice immaterial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A memorandum by the German Naval War Staff, dated 22
September 1939, (<span class='it'>C-191</span>) provides:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Flag Officer U-boats intends to give permission to U-boats
to sink without warning any vessels sailing without lights.
* * * In practice there is no opportunity for attacking
at night, as the U-boat cannot identify a target which is a
shadow in a way that entirely obviates mistakes being made.
<span class='pageno' title='827' id='Page_827'></span>
If the political situation is such that even possible mistakes
must be ruled out, U-boats must be forbidden to make any
attacks at night in waters where French and English Naval
forces or merchant ships may be situated. On the other hand,
in sea areas where only English units are to be expected, the
measures desired by F. O. U-boats can be carried out; permission
to take this step is not to be given in writing, but
need merely be based on the unspoken approval of the Naval
War Staff. U-boat commanders would be informed by word
of mouth and the sinking of a merchant ship must be justified
in the War Diary as due to possible confusion with a warship
or an auxiliary cruiser. In the meanwhile, U-boats in
the English Channel have received instructions to attack all
vessels sailing without lights.” (<span class='it'>C-191</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The War Diary of the Naval War Staff of the German Admiralty
contains the following report by Ia (Staff Operations Officer
on the Naval War Staff) on directive of the Armed Forces High
Command of 30 December 1939:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“According to this the Fuehrer, on report of the Commander
in Chief, Navy, has decided:</p>

<p>“(<span class='it'>a</span>) Greek merchant vessels are to be treated as enemy vessels
in the zone blockaded by U.S.A. and Britain.</p>

<p>“(<span class='it'>b</span>) In the Bristol Channel all ships may be attacked without
warning. For external consumption these attacks should
be given out as hits by mines.</p>

<p>“Both measures may be taken with immediate effect.” (<span class='it'>C-21</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Another report by Ia, refers to intensified measures in naval
and air warfare in connection with “<span class='it'>Fall Gelb</span>”.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“In consequence of this Directive, the Navy will authorize,
simultaneously with the general intensification of the war,
the sinking by U-boats, without any warning, of all ships in
those waters near the enemy coasts in which <span class='it'>mines can be
employed</span>. In this case, for external consumption, pretence
should be made that mines are being used. The behaviour
of, and use of weapons by, U-boats should be adapted to this
purpose.” (<span class='it'>C-21</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A third extract from the Naval War Diary, dated 6 January
1940, states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * the Fuehrer has in principle agreed (see minutes
of report of C. in C. Navy of 30 December) to authorize firing
without warning whilst maintaining the pretence of mine
hits in certain parts of the American blockaded zone.” (<span class='it'>C-21</span>)</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pageno' title='828' id='Page_828'></span></p>

<p>Whereupon, the order is given to Flag Officer, Submarines, carrying
out that decision (<span class='it'>C-21</span>).</p>

<p>The report for 18 January 1940 states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The High Command of the Armed Forces has issued the
following Directive dated 17th of January, cancelling the
previous order concerning intensified measures of warfare
against merchantmen.</p>

<p>“The Navy will authorize, with immediate effect, the sinking
without warning by U-Boats of all ships in those waters
near the enemy coasts in which the use of mines can be
pretended. U-Boats must adapt their behavior and employment
of weapons to the pretence, which is to be maintained
in these cases, that the hits were caused by mines. Ships
of the United States, Italy, Japan and Russia are exempted
from these attacks.” (<span class='it'>C-21</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>An extract from the BDU War Diary (Doenitz’s War Diary)
dated 18 July 1941, reveals a further extension of the above
order so as to cut down the protected categories:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Supplementary to the order forbidding, for the time being,
attacks on U. S. warships and merchant vessels in the operational
area of the North Atlantic, the Fuehrer has ordered
the following:</p>

<p>“1. Attack on U. S. merchant vessels sailing in British or
U. S. convoys or independently is authorized in the
original operational area which corresponds in its dimensions
to the U. S. blockade zone and which does not include
the sea-route U. S. to Iceland.” (<span class='it'>C-118</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As these orders show, at one date the ships of a particular
neutral under certain conditions could be sunk, while those of
another could not. The attitude to be adopted toward ships of
particular neutrals changed at various times, for Doenitz conducted
the U-Boat war against neutrals with cynical opportunism.
It all depended on the political relationship of Germany toward
a particular country at a particular time whether her ships were
sunk or not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>The Orders Concerning Treatment of Survivors.</span> A series
of orders led up to the issue of an order which enjoined U-Boat
commanders not merely to abstain from rescuing crews and give
them no assistance, but deliberately to annihilate them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among these preliminary standing orders of the U-Boat Command
is Order Number 154, signed by Doenitz:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Paragraph (<span class='it'>e</span>). Do not pick up survivors and take them
with you. Do not worry about the merchant-ship’s boats.
<span class='pageno' title='829' id='Page_829'></span>
Weather conditions and distance from land play no part.
Have a care only for your own ship and strive only to attain
your next success as soon as possible. We must be harsh in
this war. The enemy began the war in order to destroy
us, so nothing else matters.” (<span class='it'>D-642</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In 1942, when the United States entered the war with its
enormous ship-building capacity, the change thus brought about
necessitated a further adjustment in the methods adopted by the
U-Boats. Doenitz accordingly issued an order, which intended
not merely the sinking of merchant ships, not merely the abstention
from rescue of the crews, but their deliberate extermination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The course of events is shown by the record of a conversation
between Hitler and the Japanese Ambassador, Oshima, (<span class='it'>D-423</span>)
in the presence of Ribbentrop, on 3 January 1942:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Fuehrer, using a map, explains to the Japanese Ambassador
the present position of marine warfare in the Atlantic,
emphasizing that he considers his most important
task is to get the U-Boat warfare going in full swing. The
U-Boats are being reorganized. Firstly, he had recalled all
U-Boats operating in the Atlantic. As mentioned before,
they would now be posted outside United States ports.
Later, they would be off Freetown and the larger boats
even as far down as Capetown.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“After having given further explanations on the map, the
Fuehrer pointed out that, however many ships the United
States built, one of their main problems would be the lack
of personnel. For that reason, even merchant ships would
be sunk without warning with the intention of killing as
many of the crew as possible. Once it gets around that most
of the seamen are lost in the sinkings, the Americans would
soon have difficulties in enlisting new people. The training
of sea-going personnel takes a very long time. We are fighting
for our existence and our attitude cannot be ruled by
any humane feelings. For this reason he must give the
order that in case foreign seamen could not be taken prisoner,
which is not always possible on the sea, U-boats were
to surface after torpedoing and shoot up the lifeboats.</p>

<p>“Ambassador Oshima heartily agreed with the Fuehrer’s
comments, and said that the Japanese too are forced to
follow these methods.” (<span class='it'>D-423</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>An extract from the BDU War Diary of 16 September 1942
is part of the story in the sense that it was on the following
<span class='pageno' title='830' id='Page_830'></span>
day that the annihilation order was issued. It records an attack
on a U-boat, which was rescuing survivors, chiefly the Italian
survivors of the Allied liner “<span class='it'>Laconia</span>,” when it was attacked by
an Allied aircraft (<span class='it'>D-446</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>A Top Secret order, sent to all commanding officers of U-boats
from Doenitz’s headquarters, dated 17 September 1942, provided:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“1. No attempt of any kind must be made at rescuing members
of ships sunk, and this includes picking up persons in
the water and putting them in lifeboats, righting capsized
lifeboats, and handing over food and water. Rescue runs
counter to the rudimentary demands of warfare for the destruction
of enemy ships and crews.</p>

<p>“2. Orders for bringing in Captains and Chief Engineers
still apply.</p>

<p>“3. Rescue the shipwrecked only if their statements will be
of importance for your boat.</p>

<p>“4. Be harsh, having in mind that the enemy takes no regard
of women and children in his bombing attacks on German
cities.” (<span class='it'>D-630</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The intentions of this carefully worded order are made clear by
an extract from Doenitz’s War Diary which is personally signed
by Doenitz. The War Diary entry for 17 September 1942 reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The attention of all commanding officers is again drawn to
the fact that all efforts to rescue members of the crews of
ships which have been sunk contradict the most primitive
demands for the conduct of warfare by annihilating enemy
ships and their crews. Orders concerning the bringing in of
the Captains and Chief Engineers still stand.” (<span class='it'>D-630</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In this connection, a telegram from the Commander of the
U-boat “<span class='it'>Schacht</span>” to Doenitz’s headquarters, and the reply, are
significant. “<span class='it'>Schacht</span>” had been taking part in the rescue of survivors
from the “<span class='it'>Laconia</span>.” The telegram from “<span class='it'>Schacht</span>,” dated
18 September 1942, reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“163 Italians handed over to ‘<span class='it'>Annamite</span>.’ Navigating Officer
of ‘<span class='it'>Laconia</span>’ and another English Officer on board.” (<span class='it'>D-630</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>The telegram goes on to set out the position of English and Polish
survivors in boats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reply from Doenitz’s headquarters was sent on the 20th:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Action as in wireless telegram message of 17th of September
was wrong. Boat was detailed to rescue Italian allies and
not for the rescue of English and Poles.” (<span class='it'>D-630</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Such were Doenitz’s plans before the bombing incident ever occurred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Operation Order Atlantic No. 56,” dated 7 October 1943, contains
<span class='pageno' title='831' id='Page_831'></span>
the sailing orders of a U-boat (<span class='it'>D-663</span>). Although the date
of this order is 7 October 1943, in fact it is only a reproduction
of an order issued earlier, in the autumn of 1942. The following
is an extract from this order:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Rescue ships: A so-called rescue ship is generally attached
to every convoy, a special ship of up to 3000 gross registered
tons, which is intended for the picking up of survivors after
U-boat attacks. These ships are, for the most part, equipped
with a shipborne aircraft and large motor-boats, are strongly
armed with depth-charge throwers, and very manoeuverable,
so that they are often called U-Boat Traps by the commander.
In view of the desired destruction of ships’ crews,
their sinking is of great value.” (<span class='it'>D-663</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution does not complain against attacks on rescue
ships. They are not entitled to protection. But the point of the
foregoing order to U-boats was that priority in attack should be
given to rescue ships. This order, therefore, is closely allied with
the order of 17 September 1942 (<span class='it'>D-630</span>): in view of the Allied
shipbuilding program the German Navy had resolved to take all
means to prevent Allied ships from being manned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To summarize, it would appear from the War Diary entry of
17 September that orders on the lines discussed between Hitler
and Oshima were, in fact, issued. They have not, however, been
captured. It may be that they were issued orally, and that Doenitz
awaited a suitable opportunity before confirming them. The
incident of the bombing of the U-boats detailed to rescue the
Italian survivors from the “<span class='it'>Laconia</span>” afforded the opportunity,
and the order to all commanders was issued. Its intent is clear
when it is considered in the light of the War Diary entry. The
wording is, of course, extremely careful, but to any officer of experience
its intention was obvious: he would know that deliberate
action to annihilate survivors would be approved under that order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may be contended that this order, although perhaps unfortunately
phrased, was merely intended to stop a commander from
jeopardizing his ship by attempting a rescue, which had become
increasingly dangerous as a result of the extended coverage of the
ocean by Allied aircraft; and that the notorious action of U-Boat
Commander Eck in sinking the Greek steamer “<span class='it'>Peleus</span>” and then
machine-gunning the crew on their rafts in the water, was an exception;
and that, although it may be true that a copy of the order
was on board, this action was taken solely, as Eck himself swore,
on his own initiative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In reply it may be said that if the intention of this order was
to stop rescue attempts, in the interests of the preservation of
<span class='pageno' title='832' id='Page_832'></span>
the U-boat, it would have been done by calling attention to Standing
Order 154. Secondly, this very fact would have been prominently
stated in the order. Drastic orders of this nature are not
drafted by experienced staff officers without the greatest care
and an eye to their possible capture by the enemy. Thirdly, if it
was necessary to avoid the risks attendant on surfacing, not only
would this have been stated but there would have been no question
of taking any prisoners at all except possibly in circumstances
where virtually no risk in surfacing was to be apprehended.
Fourthly, the final sentence of the first paragraph would have
read very differently. And fifthly, if in fact—and the Prosecution
does not accept it—Doenitz did not mean to enjoin murder,
his order was so worded that he cannot escape the responsibility
which attaches to such a document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The instructions given by Admiral Doenitz with regard to the
murder of shipwrecked Allied seamen are described in an affidavit
by <span class='it'>Oberleutnant Zur See</span> Peter Josef Heisig (<span class='it'>D-566</span>). (Heisig
was called as a prosecution witness in the case against Doenitz
and testified on direct examination to the same effect, in substance,
as the statements in his affidavit.) In September 1942
Heisig was a Midshipman in a training course for U-boat officers
of the watch. On the last day of the course Grand Admiral Doenitz,
who was then Commander-in-Chief, U-boats, held an inspection
tour and made a speech to the officers in training. Heisig
describes the content of Doenitz’s speech as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * According to news received from America we
were bound to reckon with the possibility that in the Allied
countries more than 1,000,000 net registered tons of new
merchant shipping space would be brought into service
monthly. This was more shipping space than would be sunk
even with good U-boat successes. The bottleneck of the Allies
lay only in the problem of personnel for these newly built
ships. The Atlantic route was too dangerous for seamen so
that they even had to be brought aboard ship under compulsion.
This was the point where we, the U-boat crews, had
to take a hand. He therefore demanded that we should from
now on carry on total warfare against ship and crew. That
meant: so far as possible, no seaman from a sunk ship was
to get home any more. Only thus could the supply line of the
British Isles be seriously endangered and only thus in the
long run could we strike a noticeable blow at Allied merchant
shipping traffic. In this way it would be impossible for the
opponent even to make use of his newly built ships, since no
more crews would be available to him. After the sinking of
<span class='pageno' title='833' id='Page_833'></span>
a ship, every possibility of rescue must be denied to the
crew, through the destruction of every means of saving life.</p>

<p>“I later discussed these remarks of Admiral Doenitz’s with
the others, and all present unanimously and unambiguously
took them to mean that after the sinking of a ship, all possibility
of escape, whether in boats, on rafts, or by any other
means, must be denied to the crew and the destruction of the
crew was to be attempted by every means. This mode of warfare
was for me as for most of my comrades completely new.
Owing to Admiral Doenitz’s authoritative position, it was
nevertheless fully and completely accepted by many of them.
He sought to invalidate in advance any doubts which might
arise, by pointing to the air war and the bombing.” (<span class='it'>D-566</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Further light on the real meaning of the Top Secret radio message
sent by the Commander in Chief, U-boats, to all U-boat and
operational flotillas in September 1942 (<span class='it'>D-630</span>) is contained in
the statement of <span class='it'>Korvettenkapitaen</span> Karl Heinz Moehle (<span class='it'>382-PS</span>).
(Moehle was called as a Prosecution witness in the case against
Doenitz and testified on direct examination to the same effect, in
substance, as the statements in his affidavit.) Concerning this
order which was couched in terms of a prohibition against the
rescue of survivors, Moehle states as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“This W/T message was without any doubt, sent out at the
instigation of the Commander in Chief U-boats himself, i.e.
Grand Admiral Doenitz. In view of my knowledge of the
way in which the Staff of the Chief Command U-boats
worked, I consider it quite impossible that an order of such
importance could have been given without his knowledge.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“So far as concerns the order itself, it undoubtedly states, and
in particular for those who know the manner in which Commander
in Chief U-Boats is wont to give his orders, that the
High Command regard it as desirable that not only ships
but also their crews should be regarded as objects of attack,
i.e. that they should be destroyed; at that time German propaganda
was continually stressing the shortage of crews for
enemy merchant ships and the consequent difficulties. I too
understood this order in that way.</p>

<p>“Had the point of view of the High Command been otherwise
the order would undoubtedly have been expressed in different
words. It would then only have stated that for reasons
of security rescue measures were to cease and this order
would have passed as a normal secret W/T message. It was
<span class='pageno' title='834' id='Page_834'></span>
perhaps even the intention that this order could be interpreted
in two ways and the reason may be that in the first
place, it contravenes international laws of warfare and secondly,
that it was an order which must give rise to serious
conflicts of conscience in commanding officers.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“To conclude, I can only stress that the order of September
1942 appeared to me personally to go too far and I am in
total disagreement with it at heart. As a serving officer I
had however to carry out the command to pass on this order
to commanding officers for their instruction.</p>

<p>“During the long time that I was senior officer of the Flotilla
no single commanding officer mentioned to me that he could
not reconcile obedience to this order with his conscience and
that he was therefore unable to carry it out.” (<span class='it'>382-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Moehle graphically describes Doenitz’s incitement of his men
to the murder of survivors:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“A type VII boat (500-tonner) reported in her war log that
when outward bound from a base in France she met far out
in the Bay of Biscay a raft with five enemy airmen, but was
not able to take them on board owing to shortage of room
(she had a complement of 54 and carried full provisions for
14 weeks). The boat therefore proceeded without taking any
notice of the survivors.</p>

<p>“This action of the U-boat was vehemently denounced by the
Commander in Chief U-boats’ staff. It was stated that she
would have acted more correctly in destroying this raft since
it was highly probably that the enemy air crew would be rescued
by the enemy and in the meantime might once more have
destroyed a German U-boat.</p>

<p>“This occurrence made the views of the Commander in Chief
U-boats clear to me.” (<span class='it'>382-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As senior officer of the Fifth U-boat Flotilla, it was Moehle’s
duty to transmit orders from the Commander in Chief, U-boats,
to commanding officers of U-boats. In this connection, Doenitz’s
ambiguous order against the rescue of survivors caused difficulties.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I was wont to pass on this controversial and serious order
with more or less the following words:—‘I have now to inform
you of a High Command order concerning conduct
towards survivors. It is a very ticklish matter. Commander
in Chief U-boats in September 1942 gave the following order
in an ‘officers only’ signal (* * * the exact words of the
order were then read out).’
<span class='pageno' title='835' id='Page_835'></span></p>

<p>“Since I am myself in my innermost conscience in disagreement
with this order, I was very glad that in most cases
commanding officers raised no queries and I was therefore
relieved of any further discussion on this point.</p>

<p>“Sometimes however queries were raised and I was wont to
answer somewhat as follows:—</p>

<p>“ ‘I will explain the viewpoint of the High Command, which
gave this order, by reference to the following event:’ I then
mentioned the example of the Type VII boat in the Bay of
Biscay together with the explanation and viewpoint expressed
to me by Commander in Chief U-boats’ staff. I then
went on to say, ‘Gentlemen, you must yourselves decide what
is compatible with your own consciences. The safety of your
own boat must always remain your prime consideration.’ ”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“I also remember that many commanding officers after the
order of September 1942 had been read said, ‘That is quite
clear and unequivocal however hard it may be.’ Had this
order been given to me as a commanding officer I would have
taken note of it in silence but in practice would always have
been able with a clear conscience not to carry it out since I
consider I would endanger my own boat by acting in this
way, (i.e., by shooting at lift-boats).” (<span class='it'>382-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, Moehle describes the orders to omit from U-boat logs
the notation of any actions in violation of International Law:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“There was an order—I do not remember whether it was in
the form of a written or verbal instruction—that no events
during a war patrol which contravened established international
agreements should be entered in the war log. I believe
that the reason for this order was that eight copies
were made of war logs and were available to many authorities;
there was always the danger therefore that events of
this nature would become known and it was undoubtedly undesirable
for reasons of propaganda that this should be so.</p>

<p>“Events of this nature were only to be reported if asked for
when commanding officers made their personal reports; these
were invariably made after every patrol to Commander in
Chief U-boats or later in certain instances to Captain U-boats.”
(<span class='it'>382-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Two cases may be noted in which the order of 17 September
1942 (<span class='it'>D-630</span>) was apparently put into effect. The first case is
the sinking of a steam trawler, the “<span class='it'>Noreen Mary</span>,” which was
sunk by U-247 on 5 July 1944. The log of the U-Boat shows that
<span class='pageno' title='836' id='Page_836'></span>
at 1943 hours two torpedoes were fired, which missed (<span class='it'>D-645</span>).</p>

<p>At 2055 hours the log reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Surfaced.</p>

<p>“Fishing Vessels: [Bearings of 3 ships given].</p>

<p>“Engaged the nearest. She stops after three minutes.” (<span class='it'>D-645</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>There follows an account of a shot fired as the trawler lay
stopped, and then, the final entry:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Sunk by flak, with shots into her side. Sank by the stern.”
(<span class='it'>D-645</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>The U-Boat Command made this comment on the action:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Recognized success: Fishing vessel ‘<span class='it'>Noreen Mary</span>’ sunk by
flak.” (<span class='it'>D-645</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>An affidavit by James MacAlister, who was a deck-hand on
board the “<span class='it'>Noreen Mary</span>” at the time of the sinking, describes the
torpedo tracks which missed the trawler, and continues as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“At 2110 hours, while we were still trawling, the submarine
surfaced on our starboard beam, about 50 yards to the
northeast of us, and without any warning immediately
opened fire on the ship with a machine gun. We were 18
miles west from Cape Wrath, on a north-westerly course,
making 3 knots. The weather was fine and clear, sunny,
with good visibility. The sea was smooth, with light airs.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“When the submarine surfaced I saw men climbing out of
the conning tower. The skipper [of the trawler] thought
at first the submarine was British, but when she opened fire
he immediately slackened the brake to take the weight off
gear, and increased to full speed, which was about 10 knots.
The submarine chased us, firing her machine gun, and with
the first rounds killed two or three men, including the
skipper, who were on deck and had not had time to take
cover. The submarine then started using a heavier gun from
her conning tower, the first shot from which burst the
boiler, enveloping everything in steam and stopping the
ship.</p>

<p>“By now the crew had taken cover, but in spite of this all
but four were killed. The submarine then commenced to
circle round ahead of the vessel, and passed down her port
side with both guns firing continuously. We were listing
slowly to port all the time but did not catch fire.</p>

<p>“The Mate and I attempted to release the lifeboat, which was
aft, but the Mate was killed whilst doing so, so I abandoned
<span class='pageno' title='837' id='Page_837'></span>
the attempt. I then went below into the pantry, which was
below the water line, for shelter. The ship was listing more
and more to port, until finally at 2210 she rolled right over
and sank, and the only four men left alive on board were
thrown into the sea. I do not know where the other three
men had taken cover during this time, as I did not hear or
see them until they were in the water.</p>

<p>“I swam around until I came across the broken bow of our
lifeboat, which was upside down, and managed to scramble
on top of it. Even now the submarine did not submerge,
but deliberately steamed in my direction and when only 60
to 70 yards away fired directly at me with a short burst
from the machine gun. As their intention was quite obvious,
I fell into the water and remained there until the submarine
ceased firing and submerged, after which I climbed back on
to the bottom of the boat. The submarine had been firing
her guns for a full hour.” (<span class='it'>D-645</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The affidavit goes on to describe the attempts of the Second
Engineer and others to rescue themselves and to help each other;
they were later picked up by another trawler. The affidavit continues:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Whilst on board the ‘<span class='it'>Lady Madeleine</span>’ the Second Engineer
and I had our wounds dressed. I learned later that the
Second Engineer had 48 shrapnel wounds, also a piece of
steel wire 2½ inches long embedded in his body. * * *
I had 14 shrapnel wounds.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“This is my fourth wartime experience, having served in the
whalers ‘<span class='it'>Sylvester</span>’ (mined) and ‘<span class='it'>New Seville</span>’ (torpedoed),
and the Trawler ‘<span class='it'>Ocean Tide</span>’, which ran ashore.</p>

<p>“As a result of this attack by U-boat, the casualties were
six killed, two missing, two injured.” (<span class='it'>D-645</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The next case is that of the ship “<span class='it'>Antonico</span>”, which was torpedoed,
set afire, and sunk on 28 September 1942, off the coast
of French Guiana. The date of the incident is some eleven days
after the issue of the order (<span class='it'>D-630</span>). A statement given by the
Second Officer describes the attack on the ship, which by then
was on fire (<span class='it'>D-647</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * That the witness saw the dead on the deck of the
‘<span class='it'>Antonico</span>’ as he and his crew tried to swing out their lifeboat;
that the attack was fulminant, lasting almost 20
minutes; and that the witness already in the lifeboat tried
to get away from the side of the ‘<span class='it'>Antonico</span>’ in order to avoid
being dragged down by the same ‘<span class='it'>Antonico</span>’ and also because
<span class='pageno' title='838' id='Page_838'></span>
she was the aggressor’s target; that the night was dark,
and it was thus difficult to see the submarine, but that the
fire aboard the ‘<span class='it'>Antonico</span>’ lit up the locality in which she
was submerging, facilitating the enemy to see the two lifeboats
trying to get away; that the enemy ruthlessly machined-gunned
the defenseless sailors in No. 2 lifeboat, in
which the witness found himself, and killed the Second
Pilot Arnaldo de Andrade de Lima, and wounded three of
the crew; that the witness gave orders to his company to
throw themselves’ overboard to save themselves from the
bullets; in so doing, they were protected and out of sight
behind the lifeboat, which was already filled with water;
even so the lifeboat continued to be attacked. At that time
the witness and his companions were about 20 meters in
distance from the submarine.” (<span class='it'>D-647</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The U-boat’s log in that case is not available, but it may be surmised,
in view of the order that nothing compromising should be
included in entries in logs, that it would be no more helpful than
in the case of the previous incident.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A broadcast by a German Naval War Reporter on the long
wave propaganda service from Friesland, (<span class='it'>D-646-A</span>) in English,
on 11 March 1943, stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Santa Lucia, in the West Indies, was an ideal setting for
romance, but nowadays it was dangerous to sail in these
waters—dangerous for the British and Americans and for
all the colored people who were at their beck and call. Recently
a U-boat operating in these waters sighted an enemy
windjammer. Streams of tracer bullets were poured into
the sails and most of the Negro crew leaped overboard.
Knowing that this might be a decoy ship, the submarine
steamed cautiously to within 20 yards, when hand grenades
were hurled into the rigging. The remainder of the Negroes
then leaped into the sea. The windjammer sank. There
remained only wreckage. Lifeboats packed with men, and
sailors swimming. The sharks in the distance licked their
teeth in expectation. Such was the fate of those who sailed
for Britain and America.” (<span class='it'>D-646-A</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This statement shows that it was the policy of the enemy to seek
to terrorize crews. It is a part with the order with regard to
rescue ships and with the order on the destruction of steamers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Doenitz succeeded Raeder as Commander-in-Chief of the
Navy he presumably also succeeded to the equivalent rank of a
Minister of the Reich, which Raeder had held (<span class='it'>2098-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>An official report certified by an official of the British Admiralty
<span class='pageno' title='839' id='Page_839'></span>
sets out the number of meetings, the dates of the meetings, and
those present, on the occasion of meetings between Doenitz or his
representative with Hitler from the time that he succeeded Raeder
until the end (<span class='it'>D-648</span>). The certificate states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * I have compiled from them [captured documents]
the attached list of occasions on which Admiral Doenitz attended
conferences at Hitler’s headquarters. The list of other
senior officials who attended the same conferences is added
when this information was contained in the captured documents
concerned. I certify that the list is a true extract
from the collective documents which I have examined, and
which are in the possession of the British Admiralty, London.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Either Admiral Doenitz or his deputy, Konteradmiral Voss,
was present at each of the numerous meetings listed. Among
those who were also constantly present were Speer, Keitel, Jodl,
Ribbentrop, Goering, and Himmler or his lieutenants, Fegelein or
Kaltenbrunner. The inference is clear that from the time that he
succeeded Raeder, Doenitz was one of the rulers of the Reich and
was undoubtedly aware of all major decisions of policy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>The Order to Kill Commandos.</span> An internal memorandum
of the Naval War Staff, written by the division dealing with International
Law to another division, discusses the order of 18
October 1942, with regard to the shooting of Commandos (<span class='it'>C-178</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doubt appears to have arisen in some quarters with regard to
the understanding of this order. Accordingly, in the last sentence
of the memorandum it is suggested:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“As far as the Navy is concerned, it remains to be seen
whether or not this case should be used to make sure, after
a conference with the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, that
all departments concerned have an entirely clear conception
regarding the treatment of members of commando units.”
(<span class='it'>C-178</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Whether that conference took place or not is not known. The
document is dated some 11 days after Doenitz had taken over
command from Raeder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in July 1943, the Navy handed over to the SD Norwegian
and British Navy personnel, whom the Navy decided came under
the terms of the order, for shooting. An affidavit by a British
Barrister-at-Law who served as judge advocate at the trial of the
members of the SD who executed the order states (<span class='it'>D-649</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The accused were charged with committing a war crime, in
that they at Ulven, Norway, in or about the month of July
<span class='pageno' title='840' id='Page_840'></span>
1943, in violation of the laws and usages of war, were concerned
in the killing of * * *” [there follow the names
of six personnel of the Norwegian Navy, including one officer,
and one telegraphist of the British Navy, prisoners of
war.].</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“There was evidence before the Court, which was not challenged
by the Defense, that Motor Torpedo Boat No. 345 set
out from Lerwick in the Shetlands on a naval operation for
the purpose of making torpedo attacks on German shipping
off the Norwegian coast, and for the purpose of laying mines
in the same area. The persons mentioned in the charge were
all the crew of the Torpedo Boat.</p>

<p>“The defense did not challenge that each member of the crew
was wearing uniform at the time of capture, and there was
abundant evidence from many persons, several of whom were
German, that they were wearing uniform at all times after
their capture.</p>

<p>“On 27th July, 1943, the Torpedo Boat reached the island of
Aspo off the Norwegian coast, north of Bergen. On the following
day the whole of the crew were captured and were
taken on board a German naval vessel which was under the
command of Admiral von Schrader, the Admiral of the west
coast. The crew were taken to the Bergenhus, where they
had arrived by 11 p. m. on 28th July. The crew were there
interrogated by Leut. H. P. W. W. Fanger, a Naval Leutnant
of the Reserve, on the orders of Korvettenkapitaen Egon Drascher,
both of the German Naval Intelligence Service. This
interrogation was carried out upon the orders of the staff of
the Admiral of the west coast. Leut. Fanger reported to the
Officer in Charge of the Intelligence Branch at Bergen that
in his opinion all the members of the crew were entitled to
be treated as prisoners of war, and that officer in turn reported
both orally and in writing to the Sea Commander,
Bergen, and in writing to the Admiral of the west coast.</p>

<p>“The interrogation by the Naval Intelligence Branch was
concluded in the early hours of 29th July, and almost immediately
all the members of the crew were handed over on
the immediate orders of the Sea Commander, Bergen, to
Obersturmbannfuehrer of the SD, Hans Wilhelm Blomberg,
who was at that time Kommandeur of the Sicherheitspolizei
at Bergen. This followed a meeting between Blomberg and
Admiral von Schrader, at which a copy of the Fuehrer order
of the 18th October 1942 was shown to Blomberg. This order
<span class='pageno' title='841' id='Page_841'></span>
dealt with the classes of persons who were to be excluded
from the protection of the Geneva Convention and were not
to be treated as prisoners of war, but when captured were to
be handed over to the SD. Admiral von Schrader told Blomberg
that the crew of this Torpedo Boat were to be handed
over in accordance with the Fuehrer order, to the SD.”
(<span class='it'>D-649</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The affidavit goes on to describe the interrogation by officials
of the SD. These officials took the same view as the Naval Intelligence
officers, that the crew were entitled to be treated as prisoners
of war. Nevertheless, the crew were taken out and shot by
an execution squad composed of members of the SD. The affidavit
concludes as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“It appeared from the evidence that in March or April, 1945,
an order from the Fuehrer Headquarters, signed by Keitel,
was transmitted to the German authorities in Norway. The
substance of the order was that members of the crew of commando
raids who fell into German captivity were from that
date to be treated as ordinary prisoners of war. This order
referred specifically to the Fuehrer order referred to above.”
(<span class='it'>D-649</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The date mentioned is important; it was time “in March or April,
1945,” for these men to put their affairs in order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>Reasons for Not Renouncing the Geneva Convention.</span> The
minutes of conferences on 19 and 20 February 1945 between Doenitz
and Hitler read as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Fuehrer is considering whether or not Germany should
renounce the Geneva Convention * * *” [the 1929 Prisoners
of War Convention].</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The Fuehrer orders the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy
to consider the pros and cons of their step and to state his
opinion as soon as possible.” (<span class='it'>C-158</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Doenitz then stated his opinion in the presence of Jodl and a representative
of Ribbentrop:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * On the contrary, the disadvantages [of renouncing
the convention] outweigh the advantages. It would be
better to carry out the measures considered necessary without
warning, and at all costs to save face with the outer
world.” (<span class='it'>C-158</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>An extract from the minutes of another meeting between
Doenitz and Hitler, on 1 July 1944,—the extract is signed by
Doenitz—states:
<span class='pageno' title='842' id='Page_842'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * Regarding the General Strike in Copenhagen, the
Fuehrer says that the only weapon to deal with terror is
terror. Court martial proceedings create martyrs. History
shows that the names of such men are on everybody’s lips,
whereas there is silence with regard to the many thousands
who have lost their lives in similar circumstances without
court martial proceedings.” (<span class='it'>C-171</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(5) <span class='it'>Use of Concentration Camp Labor in Shipyards.</span> In a memorandum
signed by Doenitz sometime late in 1944, which was distributed
to Hitler, Keitel, Jodl, Speer, and the Supreme Command
of the Air Force, Doenitz reviews German shipping losses, and
concludes:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Furthermore, I propose reinforcing the shipyard working
parties by prisoners from the concentration camps and as a
special measure for relieving the present shortage of coppersmiths,
especially in U-boat construction, I propose to divert
coppersmiths from the construction of locomotives to shipbuilding.”
(<span class='it'>C-195</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>In dealing with sabotage, Doenitz has this to say:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Since, elsewhere, measures for exacting atonement taken
against whole working parties amongst whom sabotage occurred,
have proved successful, and, for example, the shipyard
sabotage in France was completely suppressed, possibly
similar measures for the Scandinavian countries will come
under consideration.” (<span class='it'>C-195</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Item 2 of the summing-up reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“12,000 concentration camp prisoners will be employed in
the shipyards as additional labor (security service [SD]
agrees to this)” (<span class='it'>C-195</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>It was not for nothing that at these meetings Himmler and his
Lieutenants, Fegelein and Kaltenbrunner, were present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were not there to discuss U-boats or the use of battleships.
It is clear from this document that Doenitz knew all about
concentration camps and concentration camp labor, and as one of
the rulers of Germany he must bear his full share of that responsibility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(6) <span class='it'>Doenitz’s Incitement of Ruthless Conduct By His Men.</span> The
orders issued by Doenitz in April 1945 (<span class='it'>D-650</span>) show his fanatical
adherence to the Nazi creed, and his preparedness even at that
stage to continue a hopeless war at the expense of human life, and
with the certainty of increased destruction and misery to his
country:
<span class='pageno' title='843' id='Page_843'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I therefore demand of the commanding officers of the Navy:
That they clearly and unambiguously follow the path of military
duty, whatever may happen. I demand of them that they
stamp out ruthlessly all signs and tendencies among the men
which endanger the following of this path.</p>

<p>“I demand from Senior Commanders that they should take
just as ruthless action against any commander who does not
do his military duty. If a commander does not think he has
the moral strength to occupy his position as a leader in this
sense, he must report this immediately. He will then be
used as a soldier in this fateful struggle in some position in
which he is not burdened with any tasks as a leader.” (<span class='it'>D-650</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the secret Battle order of the day of 19 April 1945, Doenitz
gives an example of the type of under-officer who should be promoted:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“An example: In a prison camp of the auxiliary cruiser
‘<span class='it'>Cormorau</span>’, in Austria, a petty officer acting as camp
senior officer, had all communists who made themselves noticeable
among the inmates of the camp systematically done
away with in such a way that the guards did not notice. This
petty officer is sure of my full recognition for his decision and
his execution. After his return, I shall promote him with all
means, as he has shown that he is fitted to be a leader.” (<span class='it'>D-650</span>)</p>

</div>

<h3>E. <span class='it'>CONCLUSION.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Doenitz was no plain sailor, playing the part of a service officer,
loyally obedient to the orders of the government of the day. He
was an extreme Nazi who did his utmost to indoctrinate the Navy
and the German people with the Nazi creed. It is no coincidence
that it was he—not Goering, not Ribbentrop, not Goebbels, not
Himmler—who was chosen to succeed Hitler. He played a large
part in fashioning the U-boat fleet, one of the most deadly weapons
of aggressive war. He helped to plan and execute aggressive
wars, which he knew well were in deliberate violation of treaties.
He was ready to stoop to any ruse where he thought he would not
be found out: breaches of the Geneva Convention or of neutrality,
where it might be asserted that sinking was due to a mine. He
was ready to order, and did order, the murder of helpless survivors

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='pageno' title='849' id='Page_849'></span>15. ERICH RAEDER</h2>

<h3>A. <span class='it'>POSITIONS HELD BY RAEDER.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Erich Raeder was born in 1876 and joined the German Navy
in 1896. By 1915 he had become commander of the Cruiser
<span class='it'>Koeln</span>. In 1928 he became an admiral, Chief of Naval Command,
and head of the German Navy. In 1935 he became Commander-in-Chief
of the Navy. In 1936 he became General Admiral, a
creation of Hitler’s, on his forty-seventh birthday. In 1937 he
received the golden badge of honor of the Nazi Party. In 1938
he became a member of the Secret Cabinet Council. In 1939 he
was made Grand Admiral, a rank created by Hitler, who presented
Raeder with a marshal’s baton. In 1943 he became Admiral
Inspector of the German Navy, which was a kind of retirement
into oblivion, since after January 1943 Doenitz was the effective
commander of the German Navy. (<span class='it'>2888-PS</span>)</p>

<h3>B. <span class='it'>RAEDER’S PART IN THE CONSPIRACY TO PLAN AND WAGE WARS OF AGGRESSION.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>During the years of Raeder’s command of the German Navy,
from 1928 to 1943, he played a vital role in building up the Navy
as an instrument of war, to implement the Nazis’ general plan of
aggression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Concealed rearmament in violation of the Treaty of
Versailles.</span> In successive and secret steps, the small Navy permitted
to Germany under the Treaty of Versailles was enormously
expanded under the guidance of Raeder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The story of Germany’s secret rearmament in violation of
the Treaty of Versailles is told in a history of the fight of the
German Navy against Versailles, 1919 to 1935, which was published
secretly by the German Admiralty in 1937 (<span class='it'>C-156</span>). This
history shows that before the Nazis came to power the German
Admiralty was deceiving not only the governments of other
countries, but its own legislature and at one stage its own government,
regarding the secret measures of rearmament ranging
from experimental U-Boat and E-Boat building to the creation of
secret intelligence and finance organizations. Raeder’s role in
these developments are described as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Admiral Raeder,
had received hereby a far-reaching independence in the building
and development of the Navy. This was only hampered
insofar as the previous concealment of rearmament had to
<span class='pageno' title='850' id='Page_850'></span>
be continued in consideration of the Versailles Treaty.”
(<span class='it'>C-156</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>An illustration of Raeder’s concealment of rearmament is
contained in his statement that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In view of Germany’s treaty obligations and the disarmament
conference, steps must be taken to prevent the first
E-boat Half-Flotilla from appearing openly as a formation
of torpedo-carrying boats, as it was not intended to count
these E-boats against the number of torpedo-carrying boats
allowed them.” (<span class='it'>C-141</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It appears that even in 1930 the intention ultimately to attack
Poland was already current in German military circles. An
extract from the History of War Organization and of the Scheme
for Mobilization (<span class='it'>C-135</span>) which is headed “All 850/38”, suggesting
that the document was written in 1938, reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Since under the Treaty of Versailles all preparations for
mobilization were forbidden, these were at first confined to
a very small body of collaborators and were at first only
of a theoretical nature. Nevertheless, there existed at that
time an ‘Establishment Order’ and ‘Instructions for Establishment,’
the forerunners of the present-day scheme for
Mobilization.</p>

<p>“An ‘establishment organization’ and ‘adaptable instructions
for establishment’ were drawn up for each A-year, the
cover name for a mobilization year.</p>

<p>“As stated, the ‘Establishment Organizations’ of that time
were to be judged purely theoretically, for they had no
positive basis in the form of men and materials. They provided,
nevertheless, a valuable foundation for the establishment
of a War Organization as our ultimate aim.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The crises between Germany and Poland, which were becoming
increasingly acute, compelled us, instead of making
theoretical preparations for war, to prepare in a practical
manner for a purely German-Polish conflict.</p>

<p>“The strategic idea of a rapid forcing of the Polish base of
Gdynia was made a basis, and the fleet on active service was
to be reinforced by the auxiliary forces which would be
indispensable to attain this strategic end, and the essential
coastal and flak batteries, especially those in Pillau and
Swinemuende were to be taken over. Thus in 1930 the
Reinforcement Plan was evolved.” (<span class='it'>C-135</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The extract further shows that Hitler had made a clear political
request to build up for him in five years, that is, by April 1938,
<span class='pageno' title='851' id='Page_851'></span>
armed forces which he could place in the balance as an instrument
of political power. (<span class='it'>C-135</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi seizure of power in 1933 was a signal to Raeder to
go full speed ahead on rearmament. In June 1934 Raeder told
Hitler that the German fleet must be developed to oppose England,
and that therefore from 1936 on, the big ships must be
armed with big guns to match the British “<span class='it'>King George</span>” class
of battleship. Raeder also went along with Hitler’s demand that
the construction of U-Boats should be kept completely secret,
especially in view of the Saar plebiscite (<span class='it'>C-189</span>). In November
1934 Raeder had a further talk with Hitler on the financing
of naval rearmament, and on that occasion Hitler told him that
in case of need he would get Doctor Ley to put 120,000,000
to 150,000,000 RM. from the Labor Front at the disposal of the
Navy. (<span class='it'>C-190</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another example of the deceit used by Raeder in building up
the German Navy is the fact that the true displacement of certain
German battleships exceeded by twenty percent the displacement
which the Nazis had reported to the British (<span class='it'>C-23</span>). In
similar vein, it was ordered that auxiliary cruisers, which were
being secretly constructed, should be referred to as “transport
ships O.” (<span class='it'>C-166</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The support given by the German Navy to the German Armament
Industry illustrates Raeder’s concern with the broader aspects
of Nazi policy and of the close link between Nazi politicians,
German Service Chiefs, and German armament manufacturers.
(<span class='it'>C-29</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>A commentary on post-1939 naval rearmament is contained in
a letter from Raeder to the German Navy, dated 11 June 1940.
This letter was given extensive distribution; in fact there is provision
in the distribution list for 467 copies. This letter of Raeder’s,
which is marked with both self-justification and apology,
reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The most outstanding of the numerous subjects of discussion
in the Officer Corps are the Torpedo position and the
problem whether the naval building program, up to Autumn
1939, envisaged the possibility of the outbreak of war as
early as 1939, or whether the emphasis ought not to have
been laid, from the first, on the construction of U-boats.</p>

<p>“If the opinion is voiced in the Officer Corps that the entire
naval building program has been wrongly directed, and that,
from the first, the emphasis should have been on the U-boat
weapon and, after its consolidation, on the large ships, I must
emphasize the following matters:
<span class='pageno' title='852' id='Page_852'></span></p>

<p>“The building up of the Fleet was directed according to the
political demands, which were decided by the Fuehrer. The
Fuehrer hoped, until the last moment, to be able to put off the
threatening conflict with England until 1944-45. At that
time the Navy would have had available a fleet with a powerful
U-boat superiority and a much more favorable ratio as
regards strength in all other types of ships, particularly
those designed for warfare on the high seas.</p>

<p>“The development of events forced the Navy, contrary to the
expectation even of the Fuehrer, into a war, which it had to
accept while still in the initial stage of its rearmament. The
result is that those who represent the opinion that the emphasis
should have been laid, from the start, on the building
of the U-boat arm, appear to be right. I leave undiscussed,
how far this development, quite apart from difficulties of
personnel, training and dockyards, could have been appreciably
improved in any way in view of the political limits of
the Anglo-German Naval Treaty. I leave also undiscussed,
how the early and necessary creation of an effective Air
Force slowed down the desirable development of the other
branches of the forces. I indicate, however, with pride the
admirable and, in spite of the political restraints in the years
of the Weimar Republic, far-reaching preparation for U-boat
construction, which made the immensely rapid construction
of the U-boat arm, both as regards equipment and personnel,
possible immediately after the assumption of power.” (<span class='it'>C-155</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This letter shows no trace of reluctance in cooperating with the
Nazi program. On the contrary, it is evident that Raeder welcomed
and became one of the pillars of the Nazi power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Conversion of the Navy into a tool of the Nazi conspiracy.</span>
Raeder, more than anyone else, was responsible for securing the
unquestioned allegiance of the German Navy to the Nazi movement—an
allegiance which Doenitz was to make even more firm
and fanatical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Raeder’s approval of Hitler was shown particularly clearly on
2 August 1934, the day of Hindenburg’s death, when Raeder and
all the men under him swore a new oath of loyalty with considerable
ceremony, this time to Adolf Hitler and no longer to
the Fatherland (<span class='it'>D-481</span>). The new oath ran as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I swear this holy oath by God that I will implicitly obey
the Leader of the German Reich and people, Adolf Hitler,
the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces and that, as a
<span class='pageno' title='853' id='Page_853'></span>
brave soldier, I will be willing to stake my life at any time
for this oath.” (<span class='it'>D-481</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>For his fatherland, Raeder substituted the Fuehrer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is no need to elaborate upon the step by which the German
Navy was progressively drawn into the closest alliance with
the Nazi Party. The facts of history—such as the incorporation
of the swastika into the ensign under which the German Fleet
sailed, and the wearing of the swastika on the uniform of naval
officers and men—these facts speak for themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazis, for their part, were not ungrateful for Raeder’s
obeisance and collaboration. His services in rebuilding the German
Navy were widely recognized by Nazi propagandists and by
the Nazi press. On his 66th birthday, the Chief Party Organ, the
“<span class='it'>Voelkischer Beobachter</span>,” published a special article about him,
which summed up Raeder’s contribution to Nazi development:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“It was to Raeder’s credit to have already built up by that
time a powerful striking force from the numerically small
fleet, despite the fetters of Versailles.</p>

<p>“With the assumption of power through National Socialism
began, too, the most fruitful period in the reconstruction of
the German Fleet.</p>

<p>“The Fuehrer openly expressed his recognition of Raeder’s
faithful services and unstinted cooperation, by appointing
him General Admiral on the 20th of April, 1936”.</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“As a soldier and a seaman, the General-Admiral has proved
himself to be the Fuehrer’s first and foremost naval collaborator.”
(<span class='it'>D-448</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Raeder’s political activities and responsibilities.</span> Raeder’s
personal part in the Nazi conspiracy arises from the fact that,
from the time of the Nazi seizure of power, he became increasingly
involved in responsibility for the general policies of the
Nazi State.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long before he was promoted to General-Admiral in 1936, he
had become a member of the secret Reich Defense Council, joining
it when it was founded, on 4 April 1933. Thus, at an early
date, he was involved, both militarily and politically, in the Nazi
conspiracy. These facts are contained in a document which contains
the classic Nazi directive:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Matters communicated orally cannot be proven; they can
be denied by us in Geneva.” (<span class='it'>EC-177</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 4 February 1938, Raeder was appointed to be a member of
a newly formed Secret Advisory Council for Foreign Affairs
<span class='pageno' title='854' id='Page_854'></span>
(<span class='it'>2031-PS</span>). Three weeks later, a decree of Hitler’s stated that,
as well as being equal in rank with a Cabinet Minister, Raeder
was also to take part in the sessions of the Cabinet (<span class='it'>2098-PS</span>).
It is thus clear that Raeder’s responsibility for the political decisions
of the Nazi State was steadily developed from 1933 to
1938, and that in the course of time he had become a member
of all the main political advisory bodies. He was a member of
the inner councils of the conspirators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As an illustration, Raeder was present at two of the key meetings
at which Hitler openly declared his intention of attacking
neighboring countries. The first of these was Hitler’s conference
at the Reichs Chancellery on 5 November 1937, concerning matters
which were said to be too important to discuss in the larger
circle of the Reich Cabinet. The minutes of this meeting establish
conclusively that the Nazis premeditated their crimes against
peace (<span class='it'>386-PS</span>). The second meeting which Raeder attended was
Hitler’s conference on 23 May 1939 (<span class='it'>L-79</span>). This was the conference
at which Hitler confirmed his intention to make a deliberate
attack upon Poland at the first opportunity, well knowing that
this must cause widespread war in Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to those two key conferences, Raeder was also present
at many others, where he placed his knowledge and professional
skill at the service of the Nazi war machine. Raeder’s
promotion of the military planning and preparation for the Polish
campaign is discussed in Section 8 of Chapter IX.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>The “Athenia Case”.</span> Once the war was underway, Raeder
also showed himself to be a master of one of the conspirators’
favorite techniques—deceit on the grand scale. His handling of
the case of the “<span class='it'>Athenia</span>” is a case in point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “<span class='it'>Athenia</span>” was a passenger liner which was sunk in the
evening of 3 September 1939, when she was outward bound to
America. About one hundred lives were lost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 23 October 1939, the Nazi Party paper, the “<span class='it'>Voelkischer
Beobachter</span>,” published in screaming headlines the story,
“Churchill sank the Athenia” (<span class='it'>3260-PS</span>). The scale on which
this deliberate lie was perpetrated is indicated by the rest of the
“<span class='it'>Voelkischer Beobachter</span>” for that day; on the front page, with
large red underlining, were the words: “Now we indict Churchill”
(<span class='it'>3260-PS</span>). An extract from the third page of this issue of the
“<span class='it'>Voelkischer Beobachter</span>” refers to photograph of the ship and
reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Churchill sank the ‘<span class='it'>Athenia</span>’. The above picture shows the
proud ‘<span class='it'>Athenia</span>’, the ocean giant, which was sunk by Churchill’s
<span class='pageno' title='855' id='Page_855'></span>
crime. One can clearly see the big radio equipment on
board the ship. But nowhere was an SOS heard from the
ship. Why was the ‘<span class='it'>Athenia</span>’ silent? Because her captain was
not allowed to tell the world anything. He very prudently
refrained from telling the world that Winston Churchill attempted
to sink the ship, through the explosion of an infernal
machine. He knew it well, but he had to keep silent. Nearly
fifteen hundred people would have lost their lives if Churchill’s
original plan had resulted as the criminal wanted. Yes,
he longingly hoped that the one hundred Americans on board
the ship would find death in the waves so that the anger of
the American people, who were deceived by him, should be
directed against Germany as the presumed author of the
deed. It was fortunate that the majority escaped the fate
intended for them by Churchill. Our picture on the right
shows two wounded passengers. They were rescued by the
freighter, ‘<span class='it'>City of Flint</span>’, and as can be seen here, turned over
to the American coast guard boat ‘<span class='it'>Gibb</span>’ for further
medical treatment. They are an unspoken accusation against
the criminal Churchill. Both they and the shades of those
who lost their lives call him before the Tribunal of the world
and ask the British people, ‘How long will the office, one of
the richest in tradition known to Britain’s history, be held
by a murderer?’ ” (<span class='it'>3260-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Contrary to these Nazi allegations, the “<span class='it'>Athenia</span>” made repeated
wireless distress signals, which were in fact intercepted
and answered by His Majesty’s ships “<span class='it'>Electra</span>” and “<span class='it'>Escort</span>,” as
well as by the Norwegian steamship “<span class='it'>Knute Nelson</span>” and the
Swedish yacht “<span class='it'>Southern Cross</span>.” In fact, the “<span class='it'>Athenia</span>” was
sunk by the German U-boat U-30. So unjustifiable was the torpedoing
of the “<span class='it'>Athenia</span>,” however, that the German Navy embarked
on a course of falsification of their records and on other
dishonest measures, in the hope of hiding the guilty secret. Meanwhile,
the Nazi propagandists sought to shift the responsibility
to the British. The Captain of U-boat 30, <span class='it'>Oberleutnant</span> Lemp,
was later killed in action, but some of the original crew of the
U-30 have survived to tell the tale as prisoners of war. An affidavit
by a member of the crew of the U-30 establishes the truth
of this episode and reveals the Nazis’ attempt to conceal the true
facts (<span class='it'>D-654</span>). The affidavit reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I, Adolf Schmidt, Official Number N 1043-33T,</p>

<p>“Do solemnly declare that:</p>

<p>“I am now confined to Camp No. 133, Lethbridge, Alberta.</p>

<p>“That on the first day of war, 3 September 1939, a ship of
<span class='pageno' title='856' id='Page_856'></span>
approximately 10,000 tons was torpedoed in the late hours
of the evening by the U-30.</p>

<p>“That after the ship was torpedoed and we surfaced again,
approximately half an hour after the explosion, the Commandant
called me to the tower in order to show me the torpedoed
ship.</p>

<p>“That I have seen the ship with my very eyes, but that I do
not think that the ship could see our U-boat at that time on
account of the position of the moon.</p>

<p>“That only a few members of the crew had an opportunity
to go to the tower in order to see the torpedoed ship.</p>

<p>“That apart from myself, <span class='it'>Oberleutnant</span> Hinsch was in the
tower when I saw the steamer after the attack.</p>

<p>“That I observed that the ship was listing.</p>

<p>“That no warning shot was fired before the torpedo was
launched.</p>

<p>“That I myself observed much commotion on board of the
torpedoed ship.</p>

<p>“That I believe that the ship had only one smoke stack.</p>

<p>“That in the attack on this steamer one or two torpedoes
were fired which did not explode but that I myself heard the
explosion of the torpedo which hit the steamer.</p>

<p>“That <span class='it'>Oberleutnant</span> Lemp waited until darkness before surfacing.</p>

<p>“That I was severely wounded by aircraft 14 September
1939.</p>

<p>“That <span class='it'>Oberleutnant</span> Lemp, shortly before my disembarkation
in Reykjavik 19 September 1939, visited me in the forenoon
in the Petty Officers quarters where I was lying severely
wounded.</p>

<p>“That <span class='it'>Oberleutnant</span> Lemp then had the Petty Officers’ quarters
cleared in order to be alone with me.</p>

<p>“That <span class='it'>Oberleutnant</span> Lemp then showed me a declaration
under oath according to which I had to bind myself to mention
nothing concerning the incidents of 3 September 1939
on board the U-30.</p>

<p>“That this declaration under oath had approximately the
following wording: ‘I, the undersigned, swear hereby that
I shall shroud in secrecy all happenings of 3 September 1939
on board the U-30, regardless whether foe or friend, and that
I shall erase from my memory all happenings of this day.’</p>

<p>“That I have signed this declaration under oath, which was
drawn up by the Commandant in his own handwriting, with
my left hand very illegibly.
<span class='pageno' title='857' id='Page_857'></span></p>

<p>“That later on in Iceland when I heard about the sinking of
the ‘<span class='it'>Athenia</span>,’ the idea came into my mind that the U-30 on
the 3 September 1939 might have sunk the ‘<span class='it'>Athenia</span>,’ especially
since the Captain caused me to sign the above-mentioned
declaration.</p>

<p>“That up to today I have never spoken to anyone concerning
these events.</p>

<p>“That due to the termination of the war I consider myself
freed from my oaths.” (<span class='it'>D-654</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Doenitz’s part in the “<span class='it'>Athenia</span>” episode is described in an affidavit
which he has sworn, in English (<span class='it'>D-638</span>). At the end of the
affidavit four words are added in Doenitz’s handwriting, the significance
of which will be adverted to shortly. Doenitz states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“U-30 returned to harbor about Mid-September. I met the
captain, <span class='it'>Oberleutnant</span> Lemp, on the lockside at Wilhelmshaven,
as the boat was entering harbor, and he asked permission
to speak to me in private. I noticed immediately
that he was looking very unhappy and he told me at once
that he thought he was responsible for the sinking of the
‘<span class='it'>Athenia</span>’ in the North Channel area. In accordance with
my previous instructions, he had been keeping a sharp lookout
for possible armed merchant cruisers in the approaches
to the British Isles, and had torpedoed a ship he afterwards
identified as the ‘<span class='it'>Athenia</span>’ from wireless broadcasts, under
the impression that she was an armed merchant cruiser on
patrol. I had never specified in my instructions any particular
type of ship as armed merchant cruiser nor mentioned
any names of ships. I despatched Lemp at once by air to
report to the SKL at Berlin; in the meantime, I ordered
complete secrecy as a provisional measure. Later the same
day or early on the following day, I received a verbal order
from <span class='it'>Kapitaen zur See</span> Fricke [head of the Operations Division
of the Naval War Staff] that:</p>

<p>“1. The affair was to be kept a total secret.</p>

<p>“2. The OKM considered that a court martial was not necessary
as they were satisfied that the captain had acted in
good faith.</p>

<p>“3. Political explanations would be handled by the OKM.</p>

<p>“I had had no part whatsoever in the political events in
which the Fuehrer claimed that no U-boat had sunk the
‘<span class='it'>Athenia</span>.’</p>

<p>“After Lemp returned to Wilhelmshaven from Berlin, I interrogated
him thoroughly on the sinking and formed the
impression that although he had taken reasonable care, he
<span class='pageno' title='858' id='Page_858'></span>
had still not taken sufficient precautions to establish fully
the identity of the ship before attacking. I had previously
given very strict orders that all merchant vessels and neutrals
were to be treated according to naval prize law, before
the occurrence of this incident. I accordingly placed him
under cabin arrest, as I felt certain that a court-martial could
only acquit him and would entail unnecessary publicity”
[whereat Doenitz has added the words, “and too much
time”]. (<span class='it'>D-638</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Doenitz’s suggestion that the captain of the U-30 sank the
“<span class='it'>Athenia</span>” in mistake for a merchant cruiser must be considered
in the light of Doenitz’s order of 22 September 1939, that</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“the sinking of a merchant ship must be justified in the War
Diary as due to possible confusion with a warship or an auxiliary
cruiser.” (<span class='it'>C-191</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The U-30 returned to Wilhelmshaven on 27 September 1939.
On that date another fraudulent entry was made in the War
Diary of the Chief of U-boats:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“U-30 comes in. She had sunk: ‘S.S. <span class='it'>Blairlogie</span>’; ‘S.S. <span class='it'>Fanad
Head</span>’.” (<span class='it'>D-659</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>There is no reference at all to the sinking of the “<span class='it'>Athenia</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps the most elaborate forgery in connection with this
episode was made on the log book of the U-30, which was responsible
for sinking the “<span class='it'>Athenia</span>” (<span class='it'>D-662</span>). The Prosecution
submits that the first page of that log book is a forgery which
shows a curiously un-German carelessness about detail. It is
clear on the original document that the first page of the text is
a substitute for pages that have been removed: The dates in the
first column of that page are in Arabic numerals. On the second
and more authentic-looking page, and throughout the other pages
of the log book, they are in Roman numerals. (<span class='it'>D-662</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Furthermore, all reference to the sinking of the “<span class='it'>Athenia</span>” on
3 September is omitted. The log book shows that at 1400 hours
on 3 September 1939 the position of the U-30 is given as AL
0278, which is one of the few positions quoted at all upon that
page, and which was some 200 miles west of the position where
the “<span class='it'>Athenia</span>” was sunk. The recorded course (due south) and
the recorded speed (10 knots)—those entries are obviously designed
to suggest that the U-30 was well clear of the “<span class='it'>Athenia’s</span>”
position on 3 September. (<span class='it'>D-662</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, the original shows Lemp’s own signature upon the
page dealing with 3 September differs from his other signature
in the text. The difference appears in the final letter of his name.
The signature in question shows a Roman “p”, whereas on the
<span class='pageno' title='859' id='Page_859'></span>
other signatures there is a script “p.” The inference is that either
the signature is a forgery or it was made by Lemp at some other,
and probably considerably later, date. (<span class='it'>D-662</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The story of the “<span class='it'>Athenia</span>” establishes that the German Navy
under Raeder embarked upon deliberate fraud. Even before
receiving Lemp’s reports, the German Admiralty had repeatedly
denied the possibility that a German U-boat could be in the area
concerned. The charts which showed the disposition of U-boats
and the position of sinking of the “<span class='it'>Athenia</span>” (discussed in Section
14 on Doenitz) have shown the dishonesty of these announcements.
The conclusion to be drawn is this: Raeder, as head of
the German Navy, knew all the facts. Censorship and information
control in Nazi Germany were so complete that Raeder, as
head of the Navy, must have been party to the falsification published
in the “<span class='it'>Voelkischer Beobachter</span>,” which was an attempt
by the Nazi conspirators to save face with their own people and
to uphold the myth of an infallible Fuehrer backed by an impeccable
war machine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(5) <span class='it'>The Attack on Norway and Denmark.</span> Truth mattered
little in Nazi propaganda, and Raeder’s camouflage was not confined
to painting his ships or sailing them under the British flag,
as he did in attacking Norway or Denmark. Raeder’s proud comment
upon the invasions of Denmark and Norway, in which he
played a leading part, (see Section 9 of Chapter IX on aggression
against Norway and Denmark), is contained in a letter of
Raeder’s to the Navy, which stated in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The operations of the Navy in the occupation of Norway
will for all time remain the great contribution of the Navy
to this war.” (<span class='it'>C-155</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(6) <span class='it'>The Attack on the U.S.S.R.</span> With the occupation of Norway
and much of Western Europe safely completed, Hitler turned
his eyes towards Russia. Raeder was against the attack on Russia
and tried his best to dissuade Hitler from embarking upon it.
Raeder approached the problem with cynicism. He did not object
to the aggressive war on Russia because of its illegality, its
immorality, its inhumanity. His only objection to it was its
untimeliness. He wanted to finish England first before going further
afield.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The story of Raeder’s part in the deliberations upon the war
against Russia is told in extracts from a German compilation of
official naval notes by the German Naval War Staff (<span class='it'>C-170</span>). The
first entry, dated 26 September 1940, shows that Raeder was advocating
to Hitler an aggressive Mediterranean policy, in which
<span class='pageno' title='860' id='Page_860'></span>
the Navy would play a paramount role, as opposed to a continental
land policy. The entry reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Naval Supreme Commander with the Fuehrer: Naval Supreme
Commander presents his opinion about the situation:
the Suez Canal must be captured with German assistance.
From Suez advance through Palestine and Syria; then Turkey
in our power. The Russian problem will then assume a
different appearance. Russia is fundamentally frightened
of Germany. It is questionable whether action against Russia
from the North will then be still necessary.” (<span class='it'>C-170</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>The entry for 14 November reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Naval Supreme Commander with the Fuehrer: Fuehrer is
still inclined to instigate the conflict with Russia. Naval
Supreme Commander recommends putting it off until the
time after the victory over England since there is heavy
strain on German forces and the end of warfare is not in
sight. According to the opinion of the Naval Supreme Commander,
Russia will not press for a conflict within the next
year, since she is in the process of building up her Navy
with Germany’s help—38 cm. turrets for battleships, etc.:—thus,
during these years she continues to be dependent upon
German assistance.” (<span class='it'>C-170</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>And again, the entry for 27 December states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Naval Supreme Commander with the Fuehrer: Naval Supreme
Commander emphasizes again that strict concentration
of our entire war effort against England as our main
enemy is the most urgent need of the hour. On the one side
England has gained strength by the unfortunate Italian
conduct of the war in the eastern Mediterranean and by the
increasing American support. On the other hand, however,
she can be hit mortally by a strangulation of her ocean traffic
which is already taking effect. What is being done for submarine
and naval air force construction is much too little.
Our entire war potential must work for the conduct of the
war against England; thus for Navy and air force every
fissure of strength prolongs the war and endangers the final
success. Naval Supreme Commander voices serious objections
against Russia campaign before the defeat of England.”
(<span class='it'>C-170</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The entry for 18 February 1941 reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Chief, Naval Operations (SKL) insists on the occupation
of Malta even before ‘<span class='it'>Barbarossa</span>’.” (<span class='it'>C-170</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The 23 February entry reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Instruction from Supreme Command, Armed Forces
<span class='pageno' title='861' id='Page_861'></span>
(OKW) that seizure of Malta is contemplated for the fall of
1941 after the execution of ‘<span class='it'>Barbarossa</span>’.” (<span class='it'>C-170</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The entry for 19 March 1941 shows that by March 1941
Raeder had begun to consider what prospects of naval action the
Russian aggression had to offer. The entry states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“In case of ‘<span class='it'>Barbarossa</span>’, Supreme Naval Commander describes
the occupation of Murmansk as an absolute necessity
for the Navy. Chief of the Supreme Command, Armed
Forces, considers compliance very difficult.” (<span class='it'>C-170</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime, the entries show that Mussolini was crying
out for a more active Nazi Mediterranean policy. The entry for
30 May reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“[Duce] demands urgently decisive offensive Egypt-Suez
for fall 1941; 12 divisions are needed for that; ‘This stroke
would be more deadly to the British Empire than the capture
of London’; Chief Naval Operations agrees completely.”
(<span class='it'>C-170</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, the entry for 6 June indicates the strategic views of
Raeder and the German Navy at that stage:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Naval Supreme Commander with the Fuehrer: Memorandum
of the Chief, Naval Operations. Observation on the
strategic situation in the Eastern Mediterranean after the
Balkan campaign and the occupation of Crete and further
conduct of the war.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The memorandum points with impressive clarity to the decisive
aims of the war in the Near East. Their advancement
has moved into grasping distance by the successes in the
Aegean area, and the memorandum emphasizes that the
offensive utilization of the present favorable situation must
take place with the greatest acceleration and energy, before
England has again strengthened her position in the Near
East with help from the United States of America. The
memorandum realizes the unalterable fact that the campaign
against Russia would be opened very shortly; demands,
however, that the undertaking ‘<span class='it'>Barbarossa</span>’, which because
of the magnitude of its aims naturally stands in the foreground
of the operational plans of the armed forces leadership,
must under no circumstances lead to an abandonment,
diminishing delay of the conduct of the war in the Eastern
Mediterranean.” (<span class='it'>C-170</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Thus Raeder, throughout, was seeking an active role for his Navy
in the Nazi war plans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once Hitler had decided to attack Russia, Raeder sought a role
<span class='pageno' title='862' id='Page_862'></span>
for the Navy in the Russian campaign. The first naval operational
plan against Russia was characteristically Nazi. The entry
for 15 June 1941 in the notes of the German Naval War Staff
reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“On the proposal of Chief Naval Operations, use of arms
against Russian submarines, south of the northern boundary
of the Poland warning area is permitted immediately; ruthless
destruction is to be aimed at.” (<span class='it'>C-170</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Keitel provides a typically fraudulent pretext for this action
in his letter dated 15 June 1941 (<span class='it'>C-38</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Subject: Offensive action against enemy submarines in the
Baltic Sea.</p>

<p>“To:</p>

<p>“High Command of the Navy—OKM (SKL)</p>

<p>“Offensive action against submarine south of the line Memel—southern
tip of Oeland is authorized if the boats cannot be
definitely identified as Swedish during the approach by German
naval forces.</p>

<p>“The reason to be given up to B-day is that our naval forces
believed to be dealing with penetrating British submarines.”
(<span class='it'>C-38</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This order was given on 15 June 1941, although the Nazi attack
on Russia did not take place until 22 June 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(7) <span class='it'>Instigation of Japanese aggression.</span> In the meantime,
Raeder was urging Hitler, as early as 18 March 1941, to enlarge
the scope of the world war by inducing Japan to seize Singapore.
Raeder’s views at his audience with Hitler on 18 March were as
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Japan must take steps to seize Singapore as soon as possible,
since the opportunity will never again be as favorable
(whole English Fleet contained; unpreparedness of U.S.A.
for war against Japan; inferiority of U. S. Fleet vis-a-vis
the Japanese). Japan is indeed making preparations for
this action, but according to all declarations made by
Japanese officers she will only carry it out if Germany proceeds
to land in England. Germany must therefore concentrate
all her efforts on spurring Japan to act immediately.
If Japan has Singapore all other East Asiatic questions regarding
the U.S.A. and England are thereby solved (Guam,
Philippines, Borneo, Dutch East Indies).</p>

<p>“Japan wishes if possible to avoid war against U.S.A. She
can do so if she determinedly takes Singapore as soon as
possible.” (<span class='it'>C-152</span>)</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pageno' title='863' id='Page_863'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>By 20 April 1941 Hitler had agreed with Raeder’s proposition
to induce the Japanese to take offensive action against Singapore.
The entry in the notes of the German Naval War Staff, for 20
April 1941, reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Naval Supreme Commander with the Fuehrer: Navy Supreme
Commander asks about result of Matsuoka’s visit,
and evaluation of Japanese-Russian pact. Fuehrer has informed
Matsuoka, ‘that Russia will not be touched if she
behaves friendly according to the treaty. Otherwise, he reserves
action for himself.’ Japan-Russia pact has been concluded
in agreement with Germany, and is to prevent Japan
from advancing against Vladisvostok, and to cause her to
attack Singapore.” (<span class='it'>C-170</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The real purpose of Hitler’s words to Matsuoka is revealed in
another description of their conversation:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * At that time the Fuehrer was firmly resolved on
a surprise attack on Russia, regardless of what was the Russian
attitude to Germany. This, according to reports coming
in, was frequently changing. The communication to
Matsuoka was designed entirely as a camouflage measure
and to ensure surprise.” (<span class='it'>C-66</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>The Axis partners were not even honest with each other. This is
typical of the jungle diplomacy with which Raeder associated
himself.</p>

<h3>C. <span class='it'>RAEDER’S PART IN THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT WAR CRIMES.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Instigation of the Navy to Violate the Rules of Warfare.</span>
Raeder throughout his career showed a complete disregard for
any international rule or usage of war which conflicted with his
intention of carrying through the Nazi program of conquest.
Raeder has himself summarized his attitude in a long memorandum
compiled by Raeder and the German Naval War Staff and
dated 15 October 1939, only a few weeks after the war started
(<span class='it'>UK-65</span>). The memorandum, which concerns the intensification
of the war at sea, reads in part as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I. Military requirements for the decisive struggle against
Great Britain.</p>

<p>“Our naval strategy will have to employ all the military
means at our disposal as expeditiously as possible. Military
success can be most confidently expected if we attack British
sea-communications wherever they are accessible to us with
the greatest ruthlessness; the final aim of such attacks is to
<span class='pageno' title='864' id='Page_864'></span>
cut off all imports into and exports from Britain. We should
try to consider the requirements. It is desirable to base all
military measures taken on existing International Law;
however measures which are considered necessary from a
military point of view, provided a decisive success can be
expected from them, will have to be carried out, even if they
are not covered by existing International Law. In principle
therefore, any means of warfare which is effective in
breaking enemy resistance should be used on some legal conception,
even if that entails the creation of a new code of
naval warfare.</p>

<p>“The supreme War Council will have to decide what measures
of military and legal nature are to be taken. Once it
has been decided to conduct economic warfare in its most
ruthless form, in fulfilment of military requirements, this
decision is to be adhered to under all circumstances and
under no circumstances may such a decision for the most
ruthless form of economic warfare, once it has been made,
be dropped or released under political pressure from neutral
powers; that is what happened in the World War to our
own detriment. Every protest by neutral powers must be
turned down. Even threats of further countries, including
the U. S. coming into the war, which can be expected with
certainty should the war last a long time, must not lead to
a relaxation in the form of economic warfare once embarked
upon. The more ruthlessly economic warfare is waged, the
earlier will it show results and the sooner will the war come
to an end. The economic effect of such military measures
on our own war economy must be fully recognized and compensated
through immediate re-orientation of German war
economy and the re-drafting of the respective agreements
with neutral states; for this, strong political and economic
pressure must be employed if necessary.” (<span class='it'>UK-65</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Those comments of Raeder are revealing and show that as an
active member of the inner councils of the Nazi state up to 1943,
Raeder must share responsibility for the many war crimes committed
by his confederates and underlings in the course of their
wars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>The Navy’s Crimes at Sea.</span> Apart from this over-all responsibility
of Raeder, certain war crimes were essentially initiated
or ordered through the naval chain of command by Raeder
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) <span class='it'>Attacks on neutral shipping.</span> The minutes of a meeting
<span class='pageno' title='865' id='Page_865'></span>
between Hitler and Raeder on 30 December 1939 read in part as
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Chief of Naval War Staff requests that full power be
given to the Naval War Staff in making any intensification
suited to the situation and to the means of war. The Fuehrer
fundamentally agrees to the sinking without warning of
Greek ships in the American prohibited area in which the
fiction of mine danger can be upheld, e.g., the Bristol
Channel.” (<span class='it'>C-27</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>At this time Greek ships also were neutral. This is another
demonstration that Raeder was a man without principle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This incitement to crime was a typical group effort, since a
directive effectuating those naval views was issued on 30 December
1939 by the OKW, and signed by Jodl (<span class='it'>C-12</span>). This directive
reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“On the 30th of December 1939, according to a report of
Ob.d.M., the Fuehrer and Supreme Commander of the Armed
Forces decided that:</p>

<p>“(1) Greek merchant ships in the area around England declared
by U.S.A. to be a barred zone are to be treated as
enemy vessels.</p>

<p>“(2) In the Bristol Channel, all shipping may be attacked
without warning—where the impression of a mining incident
can be created.</p>

<p>“Both measures are authorized to come into effect immediately.”
(<span class='it'>C-12</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>A pencilled note at the foot of this directive reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Add to (1) Attack must be carried out without being seen.
The denial of the sinking of these steamships in case the
expected protests are made must be possible.” (<span class='it'>C-12</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Another example of the callous attitude of Raeder’s Navy
towards neutral shipping is found in an entry in Jodl’s diary
for 16 June 1942 (<span class='it'>1807-PS</span>). This extract reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The operational staff of the Navy (SKL) applied on the
29th May for permission to attack the Brazilian sea and air
forces. The SKL considers that a sudden blow against the
Brazilian naval and merchant ships is expedient at this juncture
(a) because defense measures are still incomplete; (b)
because there is the possibility of achieving surprise; and
(c) because Brazil is to all intents and purposes fighting
Germany at sea.” (<span class='it'>1807-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This was a plan for a kind of Brazilian “Pearl Harbor,”
although war did not in fact break out between Germany and
Brazil until the 22 August 1942.
<span class='pageno' title='866' id='Page_866'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Raeder also caused the Navy to participate in war crimes
ordered by other conspirators. A single example will suffice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(b) <span class='it'>The order to shoot commandos.</span> On 28 October 1942
the head of the Operations Division of the Naval War Staff
promulgated to naval commands Hitler’s order of 18 October
1942 requiring the shooting of commandos. The effect of this
order was to deny the protection of the Geneva Convention to
captured commandos. The document dated 28 October 1942
reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Enclosed please find a Fuehrer Order regarding annihilation
of terror and sabotage units.</p>

<p>“This order must not be distributed in writing by Flotilla
leaders, Section Commanders or officers of this rank.</p>

<p>“After verbal distribution to subordinate sections the above
authorities must hand this order over to the next highest
section which is responsible for its confiscation and destruction.”
(<span class='it'>C-179</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>It will be difficult to conceive of clearer evidence than this, that
Raeder appreciated the wrongfulness of Hitler’s commando order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One example will show that this order was executed by the
German Navy during the period when Raeder was its Commander.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A certain commando operation of December 1942 had as its
objective an attack on shipping in Bordeaux harbor. The <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>
account of this incident states that six of the ten participants
in that commando raid were arrested, and that all were
shot on 23 March 1943 (<span class='it'>UK-57</span>). On this particular occasion
the Navy under Raeder had implemented Hitler’s order much
more expeditiously. This fact appears in extracts from the war
diary of Admiral Bachmann, who was the German Flag Officer
in charge of Western France (<span class='it'>C-176</span>). The entry for 10 December
1942 reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“About 1015. Telephone call from personal representative
of the Officer-in-charge of the Security Service in Paris,
SS Obersturmfuehrer Dr. Schmidt to Flag Officer-in-charge’s
Flag Lieutenant, requesting postponement of the shooting,
as interrogation had not been concluded. After consultation
with the Chief of Operations Staff the Security Service
had been directed to get approval direct from Headquarters.</p>

<p>“1820. Security Service, Bordeaux, requested Security Service
authorities at Fuehrer’s headquarters to postpone the
shooting for three days. Interrogations continued for the
time being.” (<span class='it'>C-176</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>The entry for the next day, 11 December 1942, reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Shooting of the two prisoners was carried out by a unit
<span class='pageno' title='867' id='Page_867'></span>
(strength 1/16) belonging to the naval officer in charge Bordeaux,
in the presence of an officer of the Security Service,
Bordeaux, on order of the Fuehrer.” (<span class='it'>C-176</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>A note in green pencil in the margin opposite this entry reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Security Service should have done this. Phone Flag Officer
in Charge in future cases.” (<span class='it'>C-176</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This provision for “future cases” was in fact an order that commandos
should be handed over to the Security Service to be shot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is therefore evident from Admiral Bachmann’s war diary
(<span class='it'>C-176</span>) that the first two men to be shot from the Bordeaux
operation were actually put to death by a naval firing party on
11 December 1942.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Naval War Staff had this comment to make upon that
shooting:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Naval Commander, West France, reports that during
the course of the day explosives with magnets to stick on,
mapping material dealing with the mouth of the Gironde,
aerial photographs of the port installations at Bordeaux,
camouflage material and food and water for several days
were found. Attempts to salvage the canoe were unsuccessful.
The Naval Commander, West France, has ordered that
both soldiers be shot immediately for attempted sabotage, if
their interrogation, which has begun, confirms what has so
far been discovered. Their execution has, however, been
postponed in order to obtain more information.</p>

<p>“According to a <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> report, both soldiers have meanwhile
been shot. The measure would be in accordance with
the Fuehrer’s special order, but is nevertheless something
new in international law, since the soldiers were in uniform.”
(<span class='it'>D-658</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>That last sentence shows clearly that the Naval High Command
under Raeder accepted allegiance to the Nazi conspiracy as of
greater importance than any question of moral principle or professional
honor. The shooting of commandos was not an act of
war, but simple murder.</p>

<h3>D. <span class='it'>RAEDER’S ASSISTANCE TO THE CONSPIRACY THROUGH HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITIES.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Raeder was not just a military puppet carrying out political
orders. Before the Nazis came to power he had worked actively
to rebuild the German Navy behind the back of the Reichstag.
When the Nazis seized power, he unreservedly joined forces with
them. He was the prime mover in transferring the loyalty of
<span class='pageno' title='868' id='Page_868'></span>
the German Navy to the Nazi Party. He himself was as much
a member of the inner councils of the Nazis as any other defendant.
He accepted membership in their main political advisory
bodies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was well aware of the designs of the Nazis and assisted in
their realization not only as a military technician, but also as a
mendacious politician. And he furthered brutal methods of warfare.
And yet of all the conspirators Raeder was one of the first
to fall from his high position. It is true that the extension of
the war beyond the boundaries of Poland came as a disappointment
to him. His vision of a Nazi Armada mastering the Atlantic
reckoned without Ribbentrop’s diplomacy and Hitler’s ideas
of strategy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a memorandum dated 10 January 1943, just before his retirement,
entitled, “The Importance of German Surface Forces
for the War by powers signatory to the Three Power Pact,”
Raeder stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“It was planned by the leaders of the National Socialist
Reich to give the German Navy by 1944/45 such a strength
that it would be possible to strike at the British vital arteries
in the Atlantic with sufficient ships, fighting power
and range.</p>

<p>“In 1939, the war having begun five years earlier, the construction
of these forces was still in its initial stages.”
(<span class='it'>C-161</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This memorandum shows how completely Raeder was cheated
in his ambitious plans by miscalculation as to when his high seas
fleet would be required. Raeder made a great effort to recover
some of his lost glory with his attack on Norway. He made many
efforts to liven up the war at sea, both at the expense of neutrals
and also of the customs and laws of the sea. His further
schemes, however, were disregarded by his fellow conspirators,
and in January 1943 he retired, and thereafter was a leader in
name only.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The record, in Raeder’s handwriting, of his interview with
Hitler on 6 January 1943, which led to Raeder’s retirement, states
in part:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“If the Fuehrer was anxious to demonstrate that the parting
was of the friendliest and wished that the name Raeder
should continue to be associated with the Navy, particularly
abroad, it would perhaps be possible to make an appointment
to General Inspector, giving appropriate publicity in the
press, etc. But a new C. in C. Navy with full responsibility
for this office must be appointed. The position of General
<span class='pageno' title='869' id='Page_869'></span>
Inspector, or whatever it was decided to call it, must be
purely nominal.</p>

<p>“Hitler accepted this suggestion with alacrity. The General
Inspector could perhaps carry out special tasks for him,
make tours of inspection, etc. The name of Raeder was still
to be associated with the Navy. After C. in C. Navy had
repeated his request, the Fuehrer definitely agreed to 30th
January as his release date. He would like to think over
the details.” (<span class='it'>D-655</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This was Raeder’s twilight, different from the period of his
ascendancy in 1939, when on 12 March he spoke on the occasion
of the German Heroes’ Day (<span class='it'>D-653</span>). In that speech, during
the celebration of “freedom to rearm,” Raeder stated, in the
presence of Hitler and representatives of the Party and Armed
Forces:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * National Socialism, which originates from the
spirit of the German fighting soldier, has been chosen by
the German people as its ideology. The German people follow
the symbols of its regeneration with the same great love
and fanatical passion. The German people has had practical
experience of National Socialism and it has not been
imposed, as so many outside critics believe. The Fuehrer
has shown his people that in the National Socialist racial
community lies the greatest and invincible sources of
strength, whose dynamic power ensures not only peace at
home, but also enables to make use of all the Nation’s
creative powers.” (<span class='it'>D-653</span>).</p>

</div>

<p>After eulogies of Hitler, Raeder continued as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“This is the reason for the clear and unsparing summons to
fight Bolshevism and international Jewry, whose race-destroying
activities we have sufficiently experienced on our
own people. Therefore, the alliance with all similar-minded
Nations who, like Germany, are not willing to allow their
strength, dedicated to construction and peaceful work at
home, to be disrupted by alien ideologies as by parasites of
a foreign race. * * * If later on we instruct in the
technical handling of weapons, this task demands that the
young soldier should also be taught National Socialist
ideology and the problems of life. This part of the task,
which becomes for us both a duty of honor and a demand
which cannot be refused, can and will be carried out if we
stand shoulder to shoulder and in sincere comradeship to
the Party and its organization. The armed forces and the
<span class='pageno' title='870' id='Page_870'></span>
Party thus became more and more united in attitude and
spirit.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“Germany is the protector of all Germans within and beyond
our frontiers. The shots fired at Almeria are proof of
that.” (<span class='it'>D-653</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>(The reference is to the bombardment of the Spanish town of
Almeria, carried out by a German naval squadron on 31 May
1937 during the course of the Spanish Civil War.) After further
panegyries on the Fuehrer and his leadership, Raeder hinted of
what was to come:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“They all planted into a younger generation the great tradition
of death for a holy cause, knowing that their blood will
lead the way towards the freedom of their dreams.” (<span class='it'>D-653</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That speech of Raeder’s illustrates his deep personal involvement
in the Nazi conspiracy. There is the mixture of heroics
and fatalism that led millions of Germans to slaughter. There
are boasts of the violence used on the people of Almeria. There
is the lip service to peace by a man who planned conquest.
“Armed forces and party have become more and more united in
attitude and spirit”—there is the authentic Nazi voice. There
is the assertion of racialism. Finally, there is the anti-Semitic
gesture, Raeder’s contribution to the outlook that produced Belsen.
Imbued with these ideas, he became an active participant on
both the political and military level in the Nazi conspiracy to
wage wars of aggression and to wage them ruthlessly.</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Schirach was also a member of the Reichstag from 1932 to 1945
(<span class='it'>2973-PS</span>).</p>

<h3>B. <span class='it'>SCHIRACH WAS AN INTIMATE AND SLAVISH FOLLOWER OF HITLER SINCE 1925.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>As early as 1925 Baldur von Schirach, then 18 years old,
joined the Nazi conspirators. Upon special request of Hitler, he
went to Munich in order to study Party affairs. After having
joined the NSDAP in 1925, he became active in converting students
to National Socialism (<span class='it'>3302-PS</span>). This was the start of
Schirach’s conspiratorial activities, which he continued for two
<span class='pageno' title='878' id='Page_878'></span>
decades in the spirit of unbending loyalty to Hitler and to the
principles of National Socialism. Schirach shows his slavish
loyalty to Hitler in his principal book, “The Hitler Youth,” published
in 1934:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“We were not yet able to account for our conception in detail,
we simply believed. And when Hitler’s book, <span class='it'>Mein
Kampf</span>, was published it was our bible which we almost
learned by heart in order to answer the questions of the
doubters and superior critics. Almost everyone today who
is leading youth in a responsible position joined us in those
years.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“In my apartment on <span class='it'>Koenigin Strasse</span>, I was lucky enough
to be able to express my apprehensions about Strasser to
the Fuehrer, otherwise I never discussed these things with
anybody with the exception of Julius Streicher.” (<span class='it'>1458-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<h3>C. <span class='it'>SCHIRACH WAS THE LEADING NAZI CONSPIRATOR IN DESTROYING INDEPENDENT YOUTH ORGANIZATIONS AND IN BUILDING THE NAZI YOUTH MOVEMENT.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(Reference is made at this point to section 8 of Chapter VII on
“Reshaping of Education and Training of Youth”. See also
<span class='it'>3054-PS</span>.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Schirach’s task to perpetuate the Nazi regime through
generations by poisoning the mind of youth, and thereby the
mind of the German people, and to prepare the German nation
for aggressive wars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The basic law concerning the Hitler Youth, which under
Schirach’s tutelage became an instrument of the Nazi State, declares:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The future of the German Nation depends on its youth,
and the German youth shall have to be prepared for its future
duties. * * *</p>

<p>“All German youth in the Reich is organized within the
Hitler Youth.</p>

<p>“The German youth besides being reared within the family
and school, shall be educated physically, intellectually, and
morally in the spirit of National Socialism to serve the people
and the community, through the Hitler Youth.</p>

<p>“The task of educating the German Youth through the
Hitler Youth is being entrusted to the Reich Leader of German
Youth in the NSDAP. * * *” (<span class='it'>1392-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p>For the five years preceding the promulgation of this law Schirach
<span class='pageno' title='879' id='Page_879'></span>
had been leader of the Hitler Youth and Reich Youth Leader of
the NSDAP. He continued in these positions until the Nazis
launched their aggressive wars. As late as 4 December 1945,
Schirach declared his own feeling of responsibility for Nazi
policies concerning youth:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I feel myself responsible for the policy of the youth movement
in the Party and later within the Reich.” (<span class='it'>3302-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Schirach actively promoted the NSDAP and its affiliated
youth organizations before the Nazis seized power.</span> In 1929
Hitler appointed Schirach leader of the National Socialist German
Students League and in 1931 leader of the Hitler Jugend.
After 1931, Schirach devoted his full time to Party work
(<span class='it'>3302-PS</span>). Before 1933, Schirach moved throughout Germany,
leading demonstrations and summoning German youth to the
Hitler Youth. When this organization and the wearing of its
uniform were forbidden by law, Schirach continued by illegal
means. Of this period he writes:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Whoever came to us during this illegal time, boy or girl,
risked everything. * * * With pistols in our belts we
drove through the Ruhr district while stones came flying
after us.” (<span class='it'>1458-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Schirach admits that Rosenberg and he were not successful before
1933 in efforts to reach “an understanding” with other youth
organizations. Schirach states that he thereupon arrived at a
conclusion which later was to spell the doom of independent
youth groups:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I realized at that time that an understanding with the
leaders of the League would never be possible and devoted
myself to the principle of the totality [<span class='it'>Totalitaet</span>] of the
Hitler Youth which in the year 1933 cost all those leagues
their independent existence.” (<span class='it'>1458-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Schirach, on behalf of the Nazi conspirators, destroyed all
independent youth organizations or caused them to be absorbed
within the Hitler Youth (Hitler Jugend).</span> After the Nazi conspirators
seized political control of Germany, Schirach was aggressive
in bringing the entire German youth within the Nazi
orbit of control and domination. Referring to the period immediately
following 30 January 1933, Schirach declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Now the problem was to apply the victory of the movement
to the entire youth. Our cabinet ministers were overburdened
with their new tasks and were working day and night.
We could not wait until they could find time to solve the
youth question by their own initiative. Therefore, we had
<span class='pageno' title='880' id='Page_880'></span>
to act ourselves. My co-workers met in my Munich apartment
and advised me to occupy the Reichs Committee
[<span class='it'>Reichsausschuss</span>] of the German Youth Leagues [<span class='it'>Jugendverbaende</span>].
I commissioned General [<span class='it'>Obergebietsfuehrer</span>]
Nabersberg with 50 members of the Berlin HJ to make a
surprise raid on the Reich Committee in the Alsenstrasse
early the next morning. This was done and at noon the
press had the report that the HJ [Hitler Youth] had taken
over the leadership of the Reich Committee.” (<span class='it'>1458-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p>By a second surprise raid, Schirach took over the Youth Hostels.
Of this Schirach writes in the same book:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“In the meantime I gained control over the Reich League for
German Youth Hostels [<span class='it'>Reichsverband fuer deutsche
Jugendherbergen</span>] in a similar manner to the one employed
with the Reich Committee.” (<span class='it'>1458-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>By using the records of the seized Reich Committee, Schirach
states that he obtained knowledge of the strength and influential
personalities of all the German youth groups.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“From this point I recognized the necessity of coming to
grips with the Greater German Union [<span class='it'>Grossdeutscher
Bund</span>].” (<span class='it'>1458-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>In June 1933, Schirach was appointed Youth Leader of the German
Reich (<span class='it'>Jugendfuehrer des Deutschen Reiches</span>) in a solemn
ceremony before Hitler. Concerning the period immediately following,
Schirach writes in the same book:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The first thing I did was to dissolve the Greater German
Union [<span class='it'>Grossdeutscher Bund</span>]. Since I headed all German
youth organizations and I had the right to decide on their
leadership, I did not hesitate for a moment to take this step,
which was for the Hitler Youth the elimination of an unbearable
state of affairs.” (<span class='it'>1458-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The dissolution of this and other youth organizations was accomplished
by orders issued by Schirach as Youth Leader of the
German Reich. (<span class='it'>2229-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this position Schirach also appointed deputies to the various
German states (<span class='it'>Landesbeauftragte</span>) “to carry out my instructions,
and I appointed district leaders [<span class='it'>Gebietsfuehrer</span>] to these
positions in all of the states in execution of my right” (<span class='it'>1458-PS</span>).
In this book Schirach also admits directing the further assimilation
or destruction of other youth organizations:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The Marxist youth as well as all political youth organizations
I prohibited after the occupation of the Reich Committee.
The one million members of the HJ which we had
on 30 January 1933 had grown to a round 3,000,000. Only
<span class='pageno' title='881' id='Page_881'></span>
the two large professional groups, the Protestant and Catholic
youth, were opposed to us.” (<span class='it'>1458-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Schirach proceeded to hold discussions with the Hitler-appointed
Reich Bishop Ludwig Mueller,</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“And in December 1933, the Reich Bishop and myself were
able to inform the Fuehrer that incorporation of the Protestant
youth into the HJ had become a reality.” (<span class='it'>1458-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>When this book was written, Schirach had not yet accomplished
the complete coordination of Catholic youth into the Hitler
Youth, though he argued that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“No reasonable man in Germany can give a reason for the
necessity of the existence of Catholic youth organizations in
their present form.” (<span class='it'>1458-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Schirach’s objective of forcing all German youth into the Hitler
Youth was finally accomplished by a decree in December 1936.
(<span class='it'>1392-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Schirach was mainly responsible for the indoctrination
and training of German youth outside home and school.</span> The law
making compulsory the organization of all German Youth within
the Hitler Youth declared that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The task of educating the German Youth through the Hitler
Youth is being entrusted to the Reich Youth Leader in the
NSDAP.” (<span class='it'>1392-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>To make Schirach’s sole competence even clearer, the first executive
order concerning the basic youth law stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The youth leader of the German Reich is solely competent
for all missions of the physical, ideological, and moral education
of the entire German youth outside of the house of the
parents and the school.” (<span class='it'>1462-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>Schirach was the principal Nazi conspirator in applying
the Leadership principle to German youth.</span> As a Reich Leader
(<span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span>) in the NSDAP, Schirach was responsible only to
Hitler or his deputy (<span class='it'>Stellvertreter</span>), Hess. In youth affairs he
was at the top of the Nazi leadership pyramid, and under him
German youth was directed by and completely subjected to the
Leadership Principle. The Leadership Principle, one of the principal
control-techniques of the Nazis was explained and glorified
by Schirach as it applied to German youth:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“A single will leads the HJ. The power of authority of the
HJ leaders, that of the smallest as well as of the largest
unit, is absolute, i.e., he has the unlimited right to give
orders because he bears the unlimited responsibility. He
<span class='pageno' title='882' id='Page_882'></span>
knows that the responsibility of the higher one comes before
that of the lower ones. Therefore, he submits silently to
the instructions of his leaders even if they are directed
against him personally. To him as well as to all young Germany
the history of the HJ is proof of the fact that a youth
community also can only be successful if it unconditionally
recognizes the authority of leadership. The success of National
Socialism is a success of discipline. The structure of
National Socialist Youth is built on the foundation of discipline
and obedience. The teachings of the time of persecution
apply even more to the period of victory and power.”
(<span class='it'>1458-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(5) <span class='it'>Schirach indoctrinated youth with the Nazi ideology.</span>
Schirach states that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It was my task to educate the youth in the aims, ideology
and directives of the NSDAP, and beyond this to direct and
to shape them.” (<span class='it'>3302-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>For this purpose the Hitler Youth had an elaborate propaganda
apparatus which published numerous periodicals, ranging from
a daily press service to monthly magazines. Through liaison
agents the Hitler Youth Propaganda Office had permanent contact
with Dr. Goebbels’ Propaganda Office of the NSDAP and
with the Ministry of People’s Enlightenment and Propaganda.
(<span class='it'>3349-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schirach, together with Dr. Robert Ley, established the Adolf
Hitler Schools in January 1937. These schools, according to the
joint statement of Reich Leaders (<span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span>) Schirach and
Ley, were open to outstanding and proven members of the Youth
Folk (<span class='it'>Jungvolk</span>), the junior section of the Hitler Youth organization.
The Adolf Hitler Schools were destined to train youth free
of charge for responsible positions in National Socialist Germany.
These schools were units of and under the jurisdiction
of the Hitler Youth. Schirach shared with Reich Organization
Leader (<span class='it'>Reichsorganisationsleiter</span>) Ley the general supervision
of the contents of the teaching, the curriculum, and the staff of
the Adolf Hitler Schools (<span class='it'>2653-PS</span>). Schirach encouraged a
close relation between members of the Hitler Youth and the German
League for Germandom abroad <span class='it'>(Verein fuer das Deutschtum
im Ausland</span>, or “VDA”). An agreement between Schirach and
the leaders of the VDA in 1933 states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“(1) With a complete respect for the important racial-political
task the Hitler Youth recommends to its members membership
in collaboration with the VDA.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p><span class='pageno' title='883' id='Page_883'></span></p>

<p>“(3) The school groups of the VDA (racial-German work
cells) assist the Hitler Youth in their work.” (<span class='it'>L-360-H</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Schirach thus subscribed to the “racial-political task” of the
NSDAP and extended his jurisdiction even beyond the border of
the German Reich. His encouragement and approval of anti-Jewish
terror by youth is discussed below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(6) <span class='it'>Through the Hitler Youth, Schirach assisted the Nazi conspirators
in developing leaders and members of the NSDAP and
its affiliated organizations, including the SA and the SS.</span> Sometime
before the launching of aggressive wars, the Hitler Youth
had become the principal source of zealous members for the
NSDAP and its affiliated organizations. Orders of the Party
Chancellery concerned with “successor problems” of the Party
emphasize constant attention to Hitler Youth members as future
Nazi leaders, thus attempting the perpetuation of the Nazi
regime and Nazi ideology for the immediate future and even into
future generations. Only Hitler Youth members who distinguished
themselves were to be admitted to the Party. Nazi
leaders were instructed to use “properly qualified full-time Hitler
Youth leaders * * * for the continuation of their political
work in the Party service,” so that a necessary succession of full-time
leaders in the Leader Corps (<span class='it'>Fuehrerkorps</span>) of the Party
would be secured. (<span class='it'>3348-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Party manual also discusses the Hitler Youth as a recruitment
agency for future Nazi leaders and members of affiliated
organizations of the NSDAP:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“To secure for the Party valuable and trained recruits for
leadership, suitable Hitler Jugend boys of over 17 can be
assigned for education and training to leaders from local
unit leaders on upwards.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“Besides the above-mentioned conditions for selections in
general, a process of elimination results from the fact that
from youth on the German is cared for, guided, and educated
by the Party. First they are assembled in the Young
Folk [<span class='it'>Jungvolk</span>] from which the young people are transferred
into the HJ. The boy of the HJ enters the SA, the
SS, the NSKK or the NSFK or participates in the work of
the affiliated organizations of the Party. After labor and
army service, he returns for service to the Party and its
affiliates, respectively.” (<span class='it'>2401-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Special arrangements existed between Himmler’s SS and
Schirach’s Hitler Youth concerning the recruiting of members of
<span class='pageno' title='884' id='Page_884'></span>
the Hitler Jugend for later service in the SS. Within the Hitler
Youth was a special group called the <span class='it'>Streifendienst</span> (Patrol Service).
Concerning this special group, an official handbook on youth
laws states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Organization of the <span class='it'>Streifendienst</span>.</p>

<p>“1. Since the <span class='it'>Streifendienst</span> in the HJ has to perform tasks
similar to those of the SS for the whole movement, it is
organized as a special unit for the purpose of securing recruits
for the general SS; however, as much as possible,
recruits for the SS special troops, for the SS Death Head
Troops, and for the officer candidate schools should also be
taken from these formations.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“4a. The selection of <span class='it'>Streifendienst</span> members is made according
to the principles of racial selection of the <span class='it'>Schutzstaffel</span>
[SS]; the competent officials of the SS, primarily unit
leaders, race authorities, and SS physicians, will be consulted
for the admission test.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“5. To insure from the beginning a good understanding
between Reich youth leadership and Reich SS leadership, a
liaison office will be ordered from the Reich youth leadership
to the SS main office starting 1 October 1938. The appointment
of other leaders to the SS sections is a subject for a
future agreement.</p>

<p>“6. After the organization is completed, the SS takes its
replacement primarily from these <span class='it'>Streifendienst</span> members.
Admission of youths of German blood who are not members
of the HJ is then possible only after information and advice
of the competent Bann leader.” (<span class='it'>2396-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Shortly afterwards, on 17 December 1938, Schirach and Himmler
entered into and signed another agreement for recruiting SS
members from the ranks of the Hitler Youth:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“To secure full success for the common effort of the SS and
the Hitler Youth by strict cooperation, to stem the flight from
the land, to build a new peasant class, to bring the best part
of the people into contact with the earth of the homeland,
the following arrangement has been made in connection with
the agreement of 26 August 1938.</p>

<p>“1. The farm service of the Hitler Youth is according to
education and aim, particularly well suited as a recruiting
organization for the <span class='it'>Schutzstaffel</span> (general SS and the armed
sections of the SS; SS special troops and SS death head
battalions).
<span class='pageno' title='885' id='Page_885'></span></p>

<p>“2. Boys who suit the special demands of the SS according to
physical conditions and moral attitude are preferably admitted
into the farm service of the Hitler Youth.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“5. All farm service members who pass the general admission
test of the SS will be taken over into the general SS after
leaving the farm service.” (<span class='it'>2567-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, by the end of 1938, the Hitler Youth had become the
main source for future SS members. (For the criminal activities
of the SS formations for which Hitler Youth members were recruited,
see Section 5 of Chapter XV of the <span class='it'>Schutzstaffeln</span> (SS).)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(7) <span class='it'>Schirach actively engaged in militarizing the Hitler Youth.</span>
In June 1933, under an agreement between Hitler and Franz
Seldte, which was negotiated in the presence of the Reich Minister
of War, the “Steel Helmet League of Front Line Soldiers”
(<span class='it'>Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten</span>) was incorporated into the
Nazi movement. The <span class='it'>Scharnhorst</span>, the youth organization of the
<span class='it'>Stahlhelm</span>, was integrated into the Hitler Youth. (<span class='it'>2260-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Hitler Youth was generally set up along military lines with
uniforms, ranks, and titles. It contained divisions called Naval
Hitler Youth, Motorized Hitler Youth, Hitler Youth Flyers, and
Signal Hitler Youth. According to an official document published
by the Reich Youth Leadership under Schirach, the object of these
divisions within the Hitler Youth was to prepare boys, respectively,
for the German merchant marine and Navy, the National
Socialist Motorized Corps (NSKK), for civil and military aviation,
and for service with signal troops. (<span class='it'>2654-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On or about 11 August 1939, just before the invasion of Poland,
an agreement was entered into between Schirach and Wilhelm
Keitel, then Chief of the High Command of the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>,
which was declared by <span class='it'>Das Archiv</span> to represent “the result of close
cooperation” between these two conspirators. The agreement
itself stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“While it is exclusively the task of the Hitler Youth to attend
to the training of their units in this direction, it is suitable
in the sense of a uniform training corresponding to the demands
of the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> to support the leadership of the
Hitler Youth for their responsible task as trainers and
educators in all fields of training for defense by special
courses * * * A great number of courses are in progress.”
(<span class='it'>2398-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The agreement stated that it “gives the possibility of roughly
redoubling” the same 30,000 leaders in the Hitler Youth schools
<span class='pageno' title='886' id='Page_886'></span>
for directing shooting practice and field training. Under the
agreement, specific arrangements were made for messing and
billeting the Hitler Youth leaders at <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> installations.
Former Hitler Youth leaders in the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>, who were specially
selected volunteers, were to be assigned as liaison officers
and deputies for carrying out this military training. (<span class='it'>2398-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler, in a speech in February 1938, represented that thousands
of German boys had received specialized training in naval,
aviation, and motorized groups within the Hitler Youth, and that
over 1 million Hitler Youth members had received instructions in
rifle shooting from 7,000 instructors. (<span class='it'>2454-PS</span>)</p>

<h3>D. <span class='it'>SCHIRACH PROMOTED THE ACCESSION TO POWER OF THE NAZI CONSPIRATORS.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>This allegation of the Indictment is born out by Schirach’s
activities in converting students to National Socialism and by his
Leadership of the Hitler Youth before the Nazis’ seizure of political
power. These activities are described above.</p>

<h3>E. <span class='it'>SCHIRACH PROMOTED THE CONSOLIDATION OF POWER OF THE NAZI CONSPIRATORS.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Schirach’s acts in accomplishing the Nazis’ complete control
over German youth are described above. These acts were of
notable assistance to the Nazi conspirators in acquiring complete
control of Germany during the pre-war years. Schirach’s own
words in 1938 leave no doubt as to his own feeling of personal
responsibility in this connection:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The struggle for the unification of the German youth is
finished. I considered it as my duty to conduct it in a hard
and uncompromising manner. Many might not have realized
why we went through so much trouble for the sake of the
youth. And yet: The National Socialist German Workers’
Party, whose trustee I felt I always was and always will be,
this Party considered the struggle for the youth as the
decisive element for the future of the German nation.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“And I promise the German public that the youth of the
German Reich, the youth of Adolf Hitler, will accomplish its
duty in the spirit of the man to whom alone their lives belong.”
(<span class='it'>2306-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pageno' title='887' id='Page_887'></span></p>

<h3>F. <span class='it'>SCHIRACH PROMOTED THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND EDUCATIONAL PREPARATIONS FOR AGGRESSIVE WAR AND THE MILITARIZATION OF NAZI-DOMINATED ORGANIZATIONS.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>A general outline of Schirach’s acts bearing on this allegation
of the Indictment appears above. By his own admission,
Schirach was the principal Nazi responsible for driving the entire
Nazi ideology into the minds of German youths, many of
whom grew up to be fanatical Nazis like Schirach himself. From
Hitler, in 1938, came boastings of the accomplishments of the
Hitler Youth in military training. Through the vast propaganda
network of the Reich Youth Leadership, through the Adolf Hitler
Schools, through the minute regimentation of youth and its subjection
to the Leadership Principle, and through the military
training of German youth, Schirach fulfilled the edict of the basic
law concerning the Hitler Youth:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The future of the German nation depends on its youth, and
the German youth shall have to be prepared for its future
duties”.</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>It has been demonstrated that the future duties of the youth entrusted
to Schirach were participation in aggressive wars.</p>

<h3>G. <span class='it'>SCHIRACH’S GENERAL FUNCTIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES AS PARTY AND GOVERNMENT LEADER IN THE REICHSGAU VIENNA.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Gau Leader</span> (<span class='it'>Gauleiter</span>). Schirach was Gau Leader of the
NSDAP for the Reichsgau Vienna from July 1940 to 1945. In
common with all other Gau Leaders, Schirach was the highest
representative of Hitler, the supreme Party Leader, in his Gau,
and he was the bearer of sovereignty (<span class='it'>Hoheitstraeger</span>) of the
Party for this regional division of the Party. As such, he possessed
“sovereign political rights”; he represented the Party with
his Gau; and he was “responsible for the entire political situation
within” this Gau. (<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Party manual makes it mandatory that each Gau Leader
meet at least once a month with leaders of the affiliated organizations
of the NSDAP, including the SA and the SS, “for the purpose
of mutual orientation”, and authorizes the Gau Leader to
call upon SA leaders and SS leaders as “needed for the execution
of a political mission.” As a Gau Leader Schirach was appointed
by Hitler and was “directly subordinate” to him. He was responsible
for coordinating activities of the NSDAP with various
state authorities, including the police and the Gestapo. (<span class='it'>1893-PS</span>)
<span class='pageno' title='888' id='Page_888'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Reich Governor</span> (<span class='it'>Reichsstatthalter</span>). Schirach was Reich
Governor of the Reichsgau Vienna from July 1940 to 1945. After
the <span class='it'>Anschluss</span> the Nazi conspirators abolished the State of Austria
as a sovereign state and divided Austria into seven Reich
Gaus, the most important of which was the Reichsgau Vienna
(<span class='it'>Reichsgau Wien</span>). Schirach, in his capacity as Reich Governor,
was the lieutenant of the head of the German State, Hitler, in his
Gau. As Reich Governor he was authorized to make decrees
and issue orders within the limitations set by the supreme Reich
authorities (<span class='it'>Oberste Reichsbehoerden</span>). He was especially under
the administrative supervision of Frick, Reich Minister of Interior.
The Reich Governor was also first mayor (<span class='it'>Erster
Buergermeister</span>) of Vienna. (<span class='it'>3301-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schirach was also Reich Defense Commissar of Vienna from
1940 to 1945. These government positions, along with his leadership
of the Party in Vienna, made Schirach the most important
representative of the Nazi conspirators in the Reichsgau Vienna.
Schirach himself states that as Reich Governor his “field was the
direction of the general administration” in Vienna. (<span class='it'>3302-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the highest Party and State leader in the Reichsgau Vienna,
Schirach was responsible for all the crimes of the Nazi conspirators
in the Reichsgau Vienna on the ground that he either
initiated, approved, executed, or abetted them. Specific examples,
described below, demonstrate that in fact he was actively and
personally engaged in Nazi crimes.</p>

<h3>H. <span class='it'>SCHIRACH PARTICIPATED IN THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY, PARTICULARLY ANTI-SEMITIC MEASURES.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Schirach bears responsibility for providing many, if not most,
of the Death Head (<span class='it'>Totenkopf</span>) members of the SS, who, in the
main, administered the concentration camps. As particularized
above, the SS, by agreement between Himmler and Schirach,
took “its replacement primarily” from <span class='it'>Streifendienst</span> members of
the Hitler Youth and only upon special permission could a non-Hitler
Youth become an SS man. Nor can Schirach escape
responsibility for his assistance in implanting in youth the Nazi
ideology, with its tenets of a master race, “sub-human” peoples,
and world domination. For such notions were the psychological
prerequisites for the instigation and toleration of the atrocities
which zealous Nazis committed throughout Germany and the
occupied countries.
<span class='pageno' title='889' id='Page_889'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Schirach directed and participated in the Nazi conspirators’
slave labor program.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(For a full discussion of the slave labor program see Chapter
X.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vienna was one of the principal cities and an independent
Reichsgau of Greater Germany. Schirach, as Gau Leader and
Reich Governor, was delegated far-reaching responsibilities concerning
the slave labor program and hence shares responsibility
for crimes of slave labor. (<span class='it'>3352-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>This document proves that the Gau Leaders were required to
be the supreme integrating and coordinating agents of the Nazi
conspirators in executing the entire manpower program. A circular
of the Party Chancellery of 22 March 1942 states that
Goering, upon the suggestion of Sauckel, had agreed that the
Gau Leaders were to become active as Sauckel’s special Plenipotentiaries
(<span class='it'>Bevollmaechtigte</span>) in order that—</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“By the leadership of the Party in full appreciation of the
competence of the corresponding Reich authorities, the highest
efficiency in the field of manpower shall be guaranteed.”
(<span class='it'>3352-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Goering gave Sauckel authority to issue orders to “the agencies
of the Party, its member organizations and affiliated organizations”
as well as to governmental authorities. By an order of
6 April 1942 Sauckel appointed the Gau Leaders as his “plenipotentiaries
for manpower within their respective Gaus,” and
charged them with the—</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * establishment of a harmonious cooperation of all
agencies of the State, of the Party, of the Armed Forces, and
of the Economy, charged with problems of manpower and
thus to create agreement between the different conceptions
and requirements to obtain the highest efficiency in the field
of manpower.” (<span class='it'>3352-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>To insure that the Gau Leaders could efficiently perform their
manpower tasks, the entire staff of the Provincial Labor Offices
were—</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * directed to be at the disposal of the Gau Leaders
for information and advice and to fulfill the suggestions and
demands of the Gau Leader for the purpose of improvements
or manpower.” (<span class='it'>3352-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>In this same order Sauckel said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“By the above mentioned commission of the Gau Leaders of
the NSDAP, I intend to lead manpower utilization to the
greatest success.” (<span class='it'>3352-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Thus, Sauckel, himself an experienced Gau Leader, bears witness
<span class='pageno' title='890' id='Page_890'></span>
to the involvement after 1942 of the Gau Leaders, including
Schirach, in the manpower utilization program of the Nazi conspirators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Furthermore, a circular from the Party Chancellery of 4
August 1942, shows that “Bearers of Sovereignty” (<span class='it'>Hoheitstrager</span>)
of the NSDAP (which included the Gau Leaders and
hence Schirach) were to familiarize themselves with the execution
of manpower directives on Eastern workers. One of the
purposes of this directive was to prevent “inept Factory heads”
from giving “too much consideration for the care of the Eastern
Workers and thereby causing justified annoyance among the
German workers” (<span class='it'>3352-PS</span>). What “consideration” was in fact
meted out to Eastern Workers in the conspirators’ manpower
utilization program is discussed in Chapter X.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Schirach participated in the conspiracy to persecute the
Churches.</span> The activity of Schirach in persecuting churches by
dissolving religious youth organizations or by incorporating them
in the Hitler Youth has been set forth above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Official letters of Martin Bormann and Hans Lammers, in
March 1941, show that church properties in Austria had been
confiscated for various pretexts after Schirach had become Gau
Leader and Reich Governor of the Reichsgau Vienna. Upon a
visit of Hitler to Vienna, Schirach and two other officials raised
with him a complaint that the confiscations should be made in
favor of Gaus rather than of the Reich. Thereafter all Gauleiters
were notified that the decision had been made in favor of the position
Schirach had taken before Hitler, namely in favor of the
Gaus. (<span class='it'>R-146</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Schirach participated in the conspiracy to persecute the
Jews.</span> Even before assuming his Governmental functions in the
Reichsgau Vienna, Schirach was responsible for encouraging anti-Jewish
terror. Before 1939, at a meeting of Heidelberg students
of the National Socialist German Students Bund (NSDStB),
Schirach was chief speaker. After praising the students for
devoting so much of their time to the affairs of the Party,</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * he declared that the most important phase of
German University life in the Third Reich was the program
of the NSDStB. He extolled various activities of the Bund.
He reminded the boys of the service they had rendered during
the Jewish purge. Dramatically he pointed across the
river to the old University town of Heidelberg where several
burnt-out synagogues were mute witnesses of the efficiency
of Heidelberg students. Those skeleton buildings would remain
<span class='pageno' title='891' id='Page_891'></span>
there for centuries, as inspiration for future students,
as warning to enemies of the State.” (<span class='it'>2441-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately after becoming Gau Leader and Reich Governor
of the Reichsgau Vienna, Schirach’s anti-Jewish measures assumed
more formidable proportions. As early as 7 November
1940, one Dr. Fischer, “by order” of the Reich Governor Schirach,
stated that—</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“investigations are being made at present by the Gestapo,
to find out how many able-bodied Jews are still available in
order to make plans for the contemplated mass projects. It
is assumed that there are not many more Jews available. If
some still should be available, however, the Gestapo has no
scruples to use the Jews even for the removal of the destroyed
synagogues. SS Colonel Huber will report personally
to the ‘<span class='it'>Regierungspraesident</span>’ in this matter.” (<span class='it'>1948-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The <span class='it'>Regierungspraesident</span> was Reich Governor Schirach’s personal
representative “within the governmental administration”
(<span class='it'>in der staatlichen Verwaltung</span>) of the Reichsgau. (<span class='it'>3301-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The above letter indicates that Schirach and his immediate subordinates
not only knew of the atrocities which had been committed
against the Jews by the Nazi conspirators in the Reichsgau,
but also that they endorsed further forced labor of Jews and
worked intimately with the Gestapo and the SS in their measures
of persecution. Within six months after Schirach became Gau
Leader and Reich Governor of Vienna, Dr. Hans Lammers informed
Schirach that—</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“the Fuehrer has decided after receipt of one of the reports
made by you, that the 60,000 Jews still residing in the Reichsgau
Vienna, will be deported most rapidly, that is still during
the war, to the General Government because of the housing
shortage prevalent in Vienna.” (<span class='it'>1950-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Lammers’ letter, dated 3 December 1940, informed Schirach that
the Governor General of Poland, Hans Frank, and the Reichsfuehrer
SS, Himmler, had been informed of the Fuehrer’s decision.
(<span class='it'>1950-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Schirach’s guilt in this connection, by his own admission, however,
runs even deeper. In a statement to the so-called European
Youth League in Vienna in 1942, Schirach stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Every Jew who exerts influence in Europe is a danger to
European culture. If anyone reproaches me with having
driven from this city, which was once the European metropolis
of Jewry, tens of thousands upon tens of thousands of
Jews into the ghetto of the East, I feel myself compelled to
<span class='pageno' title='892' id='Page_892'></span>
reply: I see in this an action contributing to European
culture.” (<span class='it'>3048-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>Conclusion.</span> Schirach bears responsibility for rendering
significant aid to the Nazi conspirators in each major phase of
the conspiracy; winning Nazi supporters before the seizure of
power; consolidating the Nazis’ control of Germany after the
seizure of power; preparing for aggressive wars; and conducting
aggressive wars. From the beginning he held important policy-making
and administrative positions. From 1931 to the Nazis’
downfall, he was one of the small group of Reich Leaders (<span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span>)
of the NSDAP who consorted together, directly subordinate
only to Hitler himself, and who provided the innermost leaven
of the Leadership Corps of the Party. For nearly a decade he
was fully in charge of perpetrating the Nazi regime by poisoning
the minds of the young generation. Although his principal assistance
to the conspiracy was given by his commission of German
youth to the conspirators’ objectives, still he also conspired to
wage crimes against humanity as a Party and governmental administrator
of high standing after the conspiracy had reached
its inevitable involvement in war of aggression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>During this period Bormann also held the following position</span>:
Member of the Reich Cabinet, 29 May 1941 to 1945.
(<span class='it'>2099-PS</span>)
<span class='pageno' title='897' id='Page_897'></span></p>

<h3>B. <span class='it'>PROMOTION OF THE ACCESSION TO POWER OF THE NAZI CONSPIRATORS, ESTABLISHMENT OF TOTALITARIAN CONTROL OVER GERMANY, AND PREPARATION FOR WAR.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Within the conspiracy Martin Bormann had the managerial
task of operating the Nazis’ Party as a center of control for the
benefit of the conspirators. First as the executive chief of the
Nazi Party under Hess, and since 1941 himself the head of the
Party, subject only to Hitler’s supreme authority, Bormann was
a key member of the Nazi conspiracy. The Party constituted the
most powerful instrument of public control at the disposal of the
conspirators. Through the Party the conspirators were able to
gain and retain power in Germany. Through it they imposed
their will on the German nation and obtained its support for their
aggressive wars. Bormann is thus responsible for the crimes
committed by the Party under the orders of the conspirators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bormann began his conspiratorial activities more than 20
years ago. In 1922, when only 22 years old, he joined the Organization
Rossbach, one of the armed illegal groups which developed
the aggressive traditions of the German Army and established a
regime of terror against the small pacifist minority in Germany.
While he was District Leader of the Organization for Mecklenburg,
he was arrested and tried for his part in a political terror
assassination. On 15 May 1924 he was found guilty by the State
Tribunal for the Protection of the Republic and sentenced to one
year in prison. (<span class='it'>2981-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3355-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon his release from jail in 1925, Bormann again took up his
subversive activities. First, he joined the Militarist Organization
Frontbann. Then, in the same year, he became a member
of the reconstituted Nazi Party, and began his rise to one of the
most influential positions in the conspiracy. In 1927 he became
Press Chief for the Party Gau of Thuringia. On 1 April 1928
he was made a District Leader in Thuringia, and Business Manager
for the entire Gau.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From 15 November 1928 to August 1930 he was on the Staff
of the Supreme Command of the SA. Thus he participated decisively
in the development of these uniformed shock troops with
which the conspirators terrorized and destroyed their opposition
inside Germany. (See Section 4 of chapter XV on the SA.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In August 1930 Bormann organized the Aid Fund (<span class='it'>Hilfskasse</span>)
of the Nazi Party, of which he became the head. Through this
Fund he collected large sums for the Party Treasury, allegedly
for the purpose of aiding families of Party members who had
<span class='pageno' title='898' id='Page_898'></span>
been killed or imprisoned while “fighting” for the Party.
(<span class='it'>3236-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 30 January 1933 the conspirators and their Party took over
the government of Germany. Shortly thereafter, in July 1933,
Bormann was given the number-three post in the Party Organization,
that of Chief of Staff to Rudolf Hess, then Hitler’s Deputy.
At the same time he was made a member of the Party Directorate
(<span class='it'>Reichsleiter</span>). In November 1933, he was made a member of the
Reichstag. (<span class='it'>3236-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Hess’ Chief of Staff, Bormann was responsible for channeling
to him the demands of the Party in all the fields of government
action. These demands were then imposed by Hess, through
his participation in Cabinet meetings, on legislation, public administration,
and appointments. (<span class='it'>Chart Number 15</span>; <span class='it'>1395-PS</span>;
<span class='it'>2001-PS</span>; <span class='it'>D-138</span>; <span class='it'>3180-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bormann also used the Party in order to strengthen the hold
of the Gestapo and the SD over the German people. On 14 February
1935 Bormann ordered all Party officers to assist the SD
in its work described as “benefiting principally the Party”
(<span class='it'>3237-PS</span>). On 3 September 1935 Bormann ordered Party agencies
to hand persons who criticize the Nazi Party or institutions
over to the Gestapo. (<span class='it'>3239-PS</span>) An order of the Party Chancery
issued on 14 December 1938, demanded closest cooperation between
Party agencies and Gestapo (<span class='it'>1723-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the flight of Hess to Scotland on 10 May 1941, Bormann
succeeded him as head of the Party under Hitler, with the title
of Chief of the Party Chancery. In that position he took over all
offices and powers formerly held by Hess, especially his membership
in the Cabinet and on the Ministers’ Council for the Defense
of the Reich (<span class='it'>2099-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only 8 months later, Hitler issued another Decree which extended
Bormann’s powers even beyond those which had been
granted to Hess. By that Decree Bormann was given extensive
control over the preparation of all laws and directives of the Cabinet,
the Fuehrer, and the Ministers’ Council for the Defense of
the Reich, and over the appointment of all public officials (the latter,
in Germany, included Judges and university teachers)
(<span class='it'>2100-PS</span>). Under this legislation Bormann must be held at least
jointly responsible for every law and order issued after 24 January
1942 by which the conspirators carried out their crimes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This decisive participation of Bormann and the Party agencies
under his direct control in the day-to-day administration of the
German war program was buttressed by the Order of the Ministers’
Council for the Defense of the Reich, dated 1 December
<span class='pageno' title='899' id='Page_899'></span>
1942, under which all Party Gau Leaders were appointed Reich
Defense Commissioners and all Gaus became Reich Defense Districts
(<span class='it'>3235-PS</span>). Under this Order the Gau leaders, who were
Party functionaries under the orders of Bormann, became the
Chief Administrators of the entire civilian war effort, not only in
Germany proper but also in all incorporated territories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This development constituted the culmination of the integration
of Party and State which had begun almost ten years earlier.
From then on, the Party, through Bormann, became a decisive
factor in the initiation and execution of all German war policies,
after having been charged in the preceding years with much of
the political and pre-military preparation of the German people
for the aggressive wars of the Conspirators. (<span class='it'>3242-PS</span>)</p>

<h3>C. <span class='it'>DISCRIMINATION AGAINST AND PERSECUTION OF OPPOSITION.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Bormann participated actively in the execution of that part of
the conspirators’ program relating to the persecution and destruction
of independent groups which were opposed to the aims of the
Conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Persecution of the Churches.</span> Bormann was among the
most relentless members of the conspirators in the persecution
of the churches. In a secret order of 6 June 1941 he stated
bluntly the aim of the conspirators—to destroy Christianity altogether:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“National Socialist and Christian concepts are irreconcilable
* * *. No human being would know anything of Christianity
if it had not been drilled into him in his childhood by
pastors. The so-called dear God in no wise gives knowledge
of his existence to young people in advance, but in an astonishing
manner in spite of his omnipotence leaves this to the
efforts of the pastors. If, therefore, in the future our youth
learns nothing more of this Christianity whose doctrines are
far below ours, Christianity will disappear by itself.” (<span class='it'>D-75</span>;
see also <span class='it'>098-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In pursuance of this aim, Bormann’s first efforts in the conspiracy’s
fight against religion were directed toward the elimination
of churchmen and church influence from the Party itself.
On 3 July 1938 a Bormann order prohibited clergymen from holding
Party offices (<span class='it'>113-PS</span>). A Bormann circular of 3 June 1939
excluded Christian Scientists from Party membership (<span class='it'>838-PS</span>).
Bormann Decrees of 9 February 1937 and 14 July 1939 excluded
clergymen and theology students from membership in the Nazi
<span class='pageno' title='900' id='Page_900'></span>
Party (<span class='it'>840-PS</span>). And a Bormann directive of 17 June 1938,
prohibited all religious activities by members of the Labor Service.
(<span class='it'>107-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bormann also opposed religious instruction in the schools. A
letter from Bormann’s office to Rosenberg on 25 April 1941 reported
success in reducing the holding of religious morning services
in schools and proposed the substitution of National Socialist
school services. (<span class='it'>070-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In order further to weaken the churches, Bormann enforced
the elimination of numerous Catholic and Protestant Divinity
Schools in Germany and Austria. In a letter to The Minister of
Education, dated 24 January 1939, Bormann denied the scientific
value of theological instruction and suggested a legal basis for the
suppression and restriction of Divinity Schools (<span class='it'>116-PS</span>). This
was followed by a report of The Ministry of Education, dated 6
April 1939, concerning the suppression and consolidation of Divinity
Schools (<span class='it'>122-PS</span>). A confidential letter from Bormann to
The Minister of Education, dated 23 June 1939, in reply to memorandum
of 6 April 1939 (<span class='it'>122-PS</span>), reported the Party’s decision
to order the suppression of numerous Divinity Schools (<span class='it'>123-PS</span>).
In a letter to Rosenberg on 12 December 1939 Bormann agreed
with the suggestion that the University Chairs belonging to the
Divinity School in the University of Munich be used for instructors
at the Nazi Academy (<span class='it'>Hohe Schule</span>). (<span class='it'>131-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bormann also used his power and position in order to demand
that other government departments deprive the churches of their
property and subject them to a discriminatory legal regime. A
Bormann letter to The Reich Minister of Finance in January 1940,
demanded that church assessments for special war tax be greatly
increased (<span class='it'>099-PS</span>). In a letter to Amann on 8 March 1940, Bormann
demanded reduction in the paper allotment of church publications
(<span class='it'>089-PS</span>). A Bormann letter to Rosenberg on 24 June
1940 submitted the draft of a discriminatory church law for Danzig
and West Prussia (<span class='it'>066-PS</span>). Throughout 1940-1941 Bormann
corresponded with numerous officials concerning confiscation
of religious art treasures. (<span class='it'>1600-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, as the war took an increasing part of Germany’s youth
into the Armed Forces, Bormann insisted that soldiers be removed
from all religious influence. In a letter to the Army High Command
in January 1939, Bormann opposed the establishment of an
Army Corps of Chaplains (<span class='it'>117-PS</span>). A Bormann letter to Rosenberg
on 17 January 1940 suggested the publication of special Nazi
literature for members of the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> in order to replace religious
<span class='pageno' title='901' id='Page_901'></span>
literature which the writer had as yet been unable to suppress
completely (<span class='it'>101-PS</span>). In a letter to Rosenberg the next
day (18 January 1940) Bormann stated that the publication of
Nazi literature for Army recruits as a countermeasure to the circulation
of religious writings was “the most essential demand of
the hour.” (<span class='it'>100-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the prosecution of this anti-Church program was turned
over to the RSHA under Himmler, the “Church Specialists” of
that organization received clear instructions as to the aims which
the Conspirators wanted them to achieve, at a meeting of the
“Church Specialists” called for that purpose on 26 September
1941:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The immediate aim: the church must not regain one inch
of the ground it has lost.</p>

<p>“The ultimate aim: destruction of the churches to be brought
about by the collection of all material obtained through
<span class='it'>Nachrichtendienst</span> activities, which will, at a given time, be
produced as evidence for the charge of treasonable activities
during the German fight for existence.” (<span class='it'>1815-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Five years earlier, Bormann had already issued an order to all
Party members demanding that they turn priests who criticized
the Party over to the Gestapo (<span class='it'>3246-PS</span>). Bormann thus bears
responsibility for the mistreatment of priests in concentration
camps throughout these years. (<span class='it'>3249-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Persecution of the Jews.</span> It was Bormann who was
charged by Hitler with the transmission and implementation of
the latter’s instructions for the “liquidation” of the Jewish population
in Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the pogrom of 8-9 November 1938, Bormann, acting on
orders of Hitler, instructed Goering to proceed to the “final settlement
of the Jewish question” in Germany. (<span class='it'>1816-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a result of this conference a series of anti-Jewish decrees
were issued. A Bormann order of 17 January 1939 demanded
compliance with new regulations under which Jews were denied
access to housing, travel, and other facilities. (<span class='it'>069-PS</span>; see
<span class='it'>1409-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bormann also acted through other government agencies to wipe
out the economic existence of a large part of the Jewish population.
A Bormann order of 8 January 1937 communicated an
order by Frick, issued at his instigation, that government employees
who consult Jewish doctors, lawyers, etc., will be denied
financial assistance. (<span class='it'>3240-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to these purely economic measures Bormann, again
<span class='pageno' title='902' id='Page_902'></span>
acting on instructions from Hitler, caused Goering to issue a
secret order severely restricting the living conditions of Jews in
Germany. (<span class='it'>841-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the outbreak of the war these anti-Jewish measures increased
in intensity and brutality. Thus, Bormann participated
in the issuance of rulings under which 60,000 Jewish inhabitants
of Vienna were deported to the Government General of Poland, in
cooperation with the SS and the Gestapo. (<span class='it'>1950-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Bormann succeeded Hess as the executive head of the
Party, he was one of the prime movers in the campaign of total
spoliation, starvation, and extermination of the Jews living under
the rule of the Conspirators. A Bormann order of 23 October
1942 announced a Ministry of Foods decree, issued at his instigation,
depriving Jews of many essential food items, and of all special
sickness and pregnancy rations, and ordering the confiscation of
food parcels (<span class='it'>3243-PS</span>). On 9 October 1942 Bormann ordered
that the problem of eliminating forever the millions of Jews from
Greater German territory could no longer be solved by emigration
but only by the application of “ruthless force” in special
camps in the East (<span class='it'>3244-PS</span>). The Thirteenth Ordinance under
The Reich Citizen Law of 1 July 1943 (RGBl, 1943, Part I, p.
372), signed by Bormann, completely excluded Jews from the ordinary
courts and handed them over to the exclusive jurisdiction
of Himmler’s police. (<span class='it'>1422-PS</span>; see also <span class='it'>3085-PS</span>)</p>

<h3>D. <span class='it'>THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT WAR CRIMES.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Bormann’s broad powers over all political aspects of the war
as a member of the Reich Cabinet and the Ministers’ Council for
the Defense of the Reich, and as executive head of the Party,
were buttressed by the creation of the post of Secretary of the
Fuehrer, to which he was appointed on 12 April 1943 (<span class='it'>2981-PS</span>).
In that position Bormann participated in all Hitler’s conferences
and became involved in the planning of war crimes by his co-conspirators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even before April 1943, however, Bormann took part in planning
the basic war policies of the conspiracy. Thus, on 16 July
1941, just three weeks after the invasion of USSR Territory,
Bormann participated in a conference at Hitler’s field headquarters
with Goering, Rosenberg, Keitel, and Reich Minister Lammers.
This conference resulted in the adoption of detailed plans
for the enslavement, depopulation, and annexation of extensive
territories in Russia and other countries of Eastern Europe. In
his report on this conference, Bormann included numerous suggestions
<span class='pageno' title='903' id='Page_903'></span>
of his own for the effective execution of these plans.
(<span class='it'>L-221</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>During subsequent years, Bormann took a prominent part in
the implementation of this conspiratorial program. A conference
on Eastern Territories between Hitler, Rosenberg, Lammers, and
Bormann on 8 May 1942, concerned <span class='it'>inter alia</span> the suppression of
religious freedom, the forceable resettlement of Dutch peasants in
Latvia, the extermination program in Russia, and the economic
exploitation of Eastern Territories (<span class='it'>1520-PS</span>). Rosenberg and
Bormann corresponded concerning the confiscation of property,
especially art treasures, in the East (<span class='it'>072-PS</span>; <span class='it'>071-PS</span>). A secret
Bormann letter of 11 January 1944 discussed large-scale organization
for the withdrawal of commodities from occupied territories
for the use of the bombed-out population in Germany.
(<span class='it'>061-PS</span>; see also <span class='it'>327-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the same time, Bormann issued a series of orders establishing
Party jurisdiction over the treatment of prisoners of war, especially
when employed as forced labor (<span class='it'>232-PS</span>). In the exercise
of that jurisdiction, he called for excessively harsh and brutal
treatment of Allied Prisoners of War. Bormann issued instructions
on 5 November 1941 prohibiting decent burials with religious
ceremonies for Russian Prisoners of War (<span class='it'>D-163</span>). A Bormann
circular of 25 November 1943 demanded harsher treatment
of prisoners of war and the fuller utilization of their man-power
(<span class='it'>228-PS</span>). In a secret circular transmitting OKH instructions of
29 January 1943, Bormann provided for the enforcement of labor
demands on Prisoners of War through the use of fire-arms and
corporal punishment. (<span class='it'>656-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>These instructions issued by Bormann culminated in the decree
of September 30 1944, signed by him. This decree took jurisdiction
over all prisoners of war out of the hands of the OKW,
handed them over to the control of Himmler, and provided that
all prisoner of war camp commanders should be under the orders
of the local SS Commanders (<span class='it'>058-PS</span>). Through this order,
Himmler was enabled to proceed with his program of extermination
of Prisoners of War. Bormann also bears part of the responsibility
for the organized lynching of Allied airmen. As early
as March 1940 Hess had ordered all Party leaders to instruct the
civilian population to “arrest or liquidate” all bailed-out allied
fliers (<span class='it'>062-PS</span>). In order to assure the success of this scheme
Bormann issued a secret circular prohibiting any police measures
or criminal proceedings against civilians who had lynched British
or American fliers (<span class='it'>057-PS</span>). For the execution of these decrees,
<span class='pageno' title='904' id='Page_904'></span>
regulations were issued to cover the systematic application
of Lynch Law against captured Allied airmen (<span class='it'>735-PS</span>). That
such lynchings actually took place has since been fully established
in a series of American Military Commission proceedings, which
resulted in the conviction of German civilians for the murder of
Allied fliers. (<span class='it'>2559-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2560-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2561-PS</span>)</p>

<h3>E. <span class='it'>THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Bormann played an important role in the administration of the
forced labor program. A Bormann circular of 5 May 1943 contained
detailed directions as to the treatment of foreign workers,
stating especially that they were subject to SS control for all security
matters and that differentiation between them and Germans
was all-important (<span class='it'>205-PS</span>). At a conference held on 4 September
1942 it was decided that recruiting, mobilization, and
treatment of 500,000 female domestic workers from the East
would be handled exclusively by Sauckel, Himmler, and Bormann.
(<span class='it'>025-PS</span>; see also <span class='it'>D-226</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bormann also imposed his views on the administration of the
occupied areas and insisted on the ruthless exploitation of the
subjected populations in the East. His views were stated in an
official memorandum of the Ministry for the Eastern Territories,
headed by Rosenberg, in which they were described as governing
actual administrative practice in the East:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Slavs are to work for us. In so far as we don’t need
them, they may die. Therefore compulsory vaccination and
German health services are superfluous. The fertility of the
Slavs is undesirable. They may use contraceptives or practice
abortion, the more the better. Education is dangerous.
It is enough if they can count up to 100. At best an education
which produces useful stooges for us is admissible.
Every educated person is a future enemy. Religion we leave
to them as a means of diversion. As for food they won’t get
any more than is necessary. We are the masters, we come
first.” (<span class='it'>R-36</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>A secret conference on 12 January 1943 discussed Bormann’s order
of 12 August 1942 under which all Party agencies were placed
at Himmler’s disposal for the latter’s program of forced resettlement
and denationalization of occupied populations (<span class='it'>705-PS</span>).
Correspondence from the Office of the Fuehrer’s Deputy reveals
Bormann’s demands that non-German populations of occupied
territories be subjected to a special discriminatory legal regime
<span class='pageno' title='905' id='Page_905'></span>
(<span class='it'>R-139</span>). An agreement between Thierack and Himmler was made
at Bormann’s suggestion, under which all Eastern populations
are subjected to brutal police regime, and under which all disputes
between the parties to the agreement are to be settled by Bormann.
(<span class='it'>654-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In issuing these orders Bormann took a large part in the conspiracy
to exterminate millions of people in the Eastern occupied
areas.</p>

<h3>F. <span class='it'>CONCLUSION.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Bormann, only 45 years old at the time of Germany’s
defeat, devoted his entire adult life to the Nazi conspiracy. When
he joined the Nazi Party at the age of 25 he had already been active
for several years in conspiratorial and terroristic organizations
working secretly to prepare Germany for war, and had
spent one year in jail for his participation in a political murder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bormann’s important contribution to the conspiracy remained
throughout in the sphere of the Nazi Party. First, as Chief of
Staff to Hess, the Fuehrer’s Deputy, then as Head of the Party
Chancery, he managed the entire organization of the Party in the
service of the conspiracy. He was responsible for channelling
the Party’s demands concerning legislation, education, civil service,
and all other fields of public and private life to Hess, who was
a member of the Reich Cabinet, which was then Germany’s legislative,
administrative, and judicial organ. Thus, Bormann advanced
the Party’s conspiratorial program through the control of
his co-conspirators over the German government machinery. He
used this power for various criminal purposes, among them the
persecution of the independent churches, demanding their complete
elimination from German life on the ground that Christianity
and National Socialism were irreconcilable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After having acceded in 1941 to the highest position in the Nazi
Party, directly under Hitler, Bormann exercised the broadest
influence in the direction of Germany’s aggressive wars. Here he
acted in two capacities:</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) As executive head of the Party he commanded the Party
Gauleaders who, as District Defense Commissioners, controlled
all civilian and political war activities in German and the annexed
territories. In that position he became responsible for the
multiple war crimes committed by the German civilian population,
especially the lynching of allied flying personnel, and the
cruel mistreatment of forced laborers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) As Secretary to the Fuehrer, Bormann took an active part
<span class='pageno' title='906' id='Page_906'></span>
in the policy-making conferences and discussions of Hitler and
his political and military staffs. Here, Bormann became jointly
responsible for the illegal annexation of Allied territories, the
enslavement and spoliation of the civilian population in occupied
countries, and the planned persecution and extermination of the
populations in Eastern territories especially the Jews.</p>

<h3>B. <span class='it'>AS EX-REICH CHANCELLOR AND PROMINENT POLITICAL LEADER, VON PAPEN USED HIS PERSONAL INFLUENCE TO PROMOTE THE ACCESSION OF THE NAZIS TO POWER.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>When von Papen began these efforts he was well aware of
the Nazi program and Nazi methods.</span> The official NSDAP program
was open and notorious. For many years it had been published
and republished in the Yearbook of the NSDAP and elsewhere.
The Nazis made no secret of their intention to make it
the fundamental law of the State. The first three points of this
program forecast a foreign policy predicated upon the absorption
of “Germanic” populations outside the boundaries of the Reich,
the abrogation of Versailles treaty limitations, and the acquisition
of “<span class='it'>Lebensraum</span>.” Points 4 to 8 foretold the ruthless elimination
of the Jews, and the 25th point demanded “unlimited
authority” of the central regime over the entire Reich as a means
“for the execution of all this” (<span class='it'>1708-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler and the other leaders of the Party repeatedly reiterated
these views before 1933. Hitler himself subsequently pointed out
that there was no excuse for misinterpreting Nazi intentions:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“When I came to power in 1933, our path lay unmistakably
before us. Our internal policy had been, exactly defined by
our fifteen-year-old struggle. Our program, repeated a thousand
times, obligated us to the German people. I should be
a man without honor, worthy of being stoned, had I retracted
a single step of the program I then enunciated
* * *”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“My foreign policy had identical aims. My program was to
abolish the Treaty of Versailles. It is futile nonsense for
the rest of the world to pretend today that I did not reveal
this program until 1933 or 1935 or 1937. Instead of listening
<span class='pageno' title='917' id='Page_917'></span>
to the foolish chatter of emigres, these gentlemen would
have been wiser to read what I have written thousands of
times.” (<span class='it'>2541-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler and other Nazi leaders repeatedly made clear their willingness
to use force if necessary to achieve their purposes. They
glorified war. <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> is replete with early evidence of such
intentions, which subsequently were reaffirmed from time to time
in the years preceding 1933 (<span class='it'>D-660</span>; <span class='it'>2771-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2512-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi leaders prior to 1933 had openly declared their intentions
to subvert democratic processes as a means to achieve
their purposes, and to this end to harass and embarrass democratic
forces at every turn. Thus Hitler himself had declared
that,</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“We shall become members of all constitutional bodies, and
in this manner make the Party the decisive factor. Of course,
when we possess all constitutional rights we shall then mould
the State into the form we consider to be the right one.”
(<span class='it'>2512-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Frick, writing in the National Socialist Yearbook, declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Our participation in the parliament does not indicate a
support, but rather an undermining of the parliamentarian
system. It does not indicate that we renounce our anti-parliamentarian
attitude, but that we are fighting the enemy
with his own weapons and that we are fighting for our National
Socialist goal from the parliamentary platform.”
(<span class='it'>2742-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The practical application of these purposes was thus subsequently
described by a leading Nazi constitutional authority,
Ernst Rudolf Huber:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It was necessary above all to make formal use of the possibilities
of the party-state system but to refuse real cooperation
and thereby to render the parliamentary system, which
is by nature dependent upon the responsible cooperation
of the opposition, incapable of action.” (<span class='it'>2633-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This practical application of Nazi purposes and methods was
manifest at the time von Papen was a member of the Reichstag
and Vice Chancellor. By this time the Nazi members of the
Reichstag were engaging in tactics of disturbance which finally
culminated in physical attacks upon members of the Reichstag
and upon visitors, and were using terroristic measures to assure
their election (<span class='it'>L-83</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Von Papen not only had the opportunity to observe early manifestations
of Nazi violence and irresponsibility. He fully understood
<span class='pageno' title='918' id='Page_918'></span>
the true character of the Nazi menace before 1933 and publicly
condemned it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the time of the German elections in the summer of 1932, von
Papen, President Hindenburg, and certain other German leaders
were hoping that the rising Nazi menace would be dissipated by
providing for National Socialist participation in a rightist-centrist
government. Hitler refused all overtures inviting such
participation, even when suggested by President Hindenburg
himself, insisting upon assuming the chancellorship without obligation
to other parties. Hitler’s refusal at this time to collaborate
with Hindenburg and Papen marked the beginning of
a series of public declarations in which von Papen revealed a
clear understanding of Nazi methods and objections. Thus, on
the occasion of his Munster speech of 28 August 1932 von Papen
declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The licentiousness emanating from the appeal of the leader
of the National Socialist Movement does not comply very
well with his claims to governmental power.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“I do not concede him the right to regard the mere minority
following his banner solely as the German nation, and to
treat all our fellow countrymen as ‘free game’.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“I am advocating the constitutional state, the community of
the people, law and order in government. In doing so, it is
I, and not he, who is carrying on the struggle against the
domination of parties, against arbitrarianism and injustice,
a struggle which millions of his supporters had been wholeheartedly
longing for years to fight.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“I am firmly determined to stamp out the smouldering flame
of civil war, to put an end to political unrest and political
violence, which today is still such a great obstacle to the
positive work representing the sole task of the State.”
(<span class='it'>3314-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Writing in the September 1932 issue of the periodical “<span class='it'>Volk und
Reich</span>,” von Papen declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The present situation clearly shows that party domination
and State leadership are concepts incompatible with one another.
It is conceivable theoretically that a party might gain
the majority in parliament and claims the government
(State leadership) for itself. The NSDAP has proclaimed
this theoretical possibility as its practical goal and has come
very close to attaining it. It is to be hoped that the leaders
<span class='pageno' title='919' id='Page_919'></span>
of this movement will place the nation above the party and
will thus lend a visible expression to the faith of millions
looking for a way out of the spiritual and material distress
of the nation provided also by the leadership of the State.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“* * * The hope in the hearts of millions of national
socialists can be fulfilled only by an authoritarian government.
The problem of forming a cabinet on the basis of a
parliamentary coalition has again been brought into the field
of public political discussion. If such negotiations, in the
face of growing distress, are conducted with the motif
of destroying the political opponent by the failure of
his governmental activity, this is a dangerous game
against which one cannot warn enough. In the last
analysis such plans can mean nothing else but a tactics
which counts on the possibility that matters get worse
for the people and that the faith of millions will turn into
the bitterest disappointment, if these tactics only result in
the destruction of the political adversary. It is within the
nature of such party-tactical maneuvers that they are veiled
and will be disclaimed in public. That, however, cannot prevent
me from warning publicly against such plans, about
which it may be undecided who is the betrayer and who the
betrayed one; plans, though, which will certainly cheat the
German people out of their hope for improvement of their
situation. Nothing can prove more urgently the necessity
for an authoritarian government than such a prospect of
maneuvers of a tactical game by the parties.” (Papen article
quoted in “Frankfurter Zeitung”, 2 Sept. 1932, p. 2).</p>

</div>

<p>In his Munich speech on 13 October 1932 von Papen was especially
clear:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The essence of conservative ideology is its being anchored
in the divine order of things. That too is its fundamental
difference compared with the doctrine advocated by the
NSDAP. The principle of ‘exclusiveness’ of a political ‘everything
or nothing’ which the latter adheres to, its mythical
Messiah-belief in the bombastic Fuehrer who alone is destined
to direct fate, gives it the character of a political sect.
And therein I see the unbridgeable cleavage between a conservative
policy born of faith and a national-socialist creed
as a matter of politics. It seems to me that today names and
individuals are unimportant when Germany’s final fate is at
stake. What the nation demands is this: it expects of a
movement which has written upon its banner the internal
<span class='pageno' title='920' id='Page_920'></span>
and external national freedom that it will act, at all times
and under all circumstances, as if it were the spiritual, social
and political conscience of the nation. If it does not act that
way; if this movement follows merely tactical points of view,
democratic-parliamentarian points of view, if it engages in
the soliciting of mass support using demagogic agitation and
means of proletarian class struggle—then it is not a movement
any more, it has become a political party.</p>

<p>“And, indeed, the Reich was almost destroyed by the political
parties. One simply cannot, on one side, despise mercilessly
masses and majorities, as Herr Hitler is doing, and on
the other hand surrender to parliamentarian democracy;
surrender to the extent of adopting resolutions against one’s
own government together with Bolshevists.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“In the interest of the entire nation we decline the claim to
power by parties which want to own their followers body and
soul, and which want to put themselves, as a party or a movement,
over and above the whole nation.” (<span class='it'>3317-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In a series of interviews and speeches in the fall of 1932 von
Papen castigated the Nazi party for its ambitions to achieve a
total and centralized control of Germany. He contrasted its objectives
and methods to his own “conservatism” and emphasized
its incompatibility with the preservation of the “federalistic”
type of government to which he was committed. His public pronouncements
in this connection were clearly reflected in the contemporary
press:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Von Papen claimed that it had been his aim from the very
beginning of his tenure in office to build a new Reich for and
with the various states [<span class='it'>Laender</span>]. The Reich government
is taking a definite federalist attitude. Its slogan is not a
dreary centralism or unitarianism.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“Wherever one did hear von Papen express himself in public,
one did hear a chancellor who took special care to be regarded
as an unconditional federalist.” (<span class='it'>3318-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Vice Chancellor’s campaign against the Nazis culminated
finally in a radio speech to the German public on 4 November
1932, in which he severely criticized Nazi political methods. He
damned the Nazis’ “pure party egoism” which resulted in methods
described by him as “sabotage” and as “a crime against the
nation.” He accused the Nazis of wanting complete and permanent
power in Germany (<span class='it'>Deutsche Reichsgeshichte in Dokumenten
IV</span>, p. 523 (Rundfunkrede des Reichkanzlers von Papen)).
<span class='pageno' title='921' id='Page_921'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor was von Papen content merely to make speeches against
the Nazis. As late as November 1932, Papen was prepared to
use all the forces at the command of the state in a supreme effort
to suppress the rising Nazi menace. He was deterred from this
purpose only by a failure to secure the support of his cabinet.
The inner struggles of the German cabinet at this time are recounted
by Otto Meissner (in a statement made at Nurnberg, 28
November 1945), Chief of the Chancery of Reichspresident Hindenburg.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Papen’s reappointment as Chancellor by President Hindenburg
would have been probable if he had been prepared to
take up an open fight against the National Socialists, which
would have involved the threat or use of force. Almost up
to the time of his resignation, Papen and some of the other
ministers agreed on the necessity for pressing the fight
against the Nazis by employing all the resources of the State
and relying on Article 48 of the Constitution, even if this
might lead to armed conflict. Other ministers, however, believed
that such a course would lead to civil war.</p>

<p>“The decision was provided by Schleicher, who in earlier
times had recommended energetic action against the National
Socialists—even if this meant the use of police and
army. Now, in the decisive cabinet meeting, he abandoned
this idea and declared himself for an understanding with
Hitler.</p>

<p>“The gist of Schleicher’s report—which was given partly by
himself, partly by Major Ott, who adduced detailed statistical
material—was that the weakened Reichswehr, which was
dispersed over the whole Reich, even if supported by civilian
volunteer formations, would not be equal to military operations
on a large scale, and was not suited and trained for
civil war. The police, in particular the Prussian police, had
been undermined by propaganda and could not be considered
as absolutely reliable. If the Nazis began an armed revolt,
one must anticipate a revolt of the Communists and a general
strike at the same time. The forces of these two adversaries
were very strong. If such a ‘war against two
fronts’ should take place, the forces of the State would undoubtedly
be disrupted. The outcome of a civil war would
be at the least most uncertain.</p>

<p>“In his, Schleicher’s view, it was impossible to take the risks
implied in such a policy. In case of failure, which he believed
likely, the consequences for Germany would be terrible. All
present in the cabinet meeting were deeply impressed by
<span class='pageno' title='922' id='Page_922'></span>
Schleicher’s statement, and even those who had been in favor
of energetic action against the National Socialists now
changed their mind, so that Papen was isolated and felt himself
to be isolated.</p>

<p>“In the interview which Papen had with Hindenburg after
this meeting, on November 17th 1932 Papen did not conceal
his deep disappointment over Schleicher’s altered position.
Although Hindenburg asked him to make a new attempt to
form a government, Papen stood on his decision to resign
and Hindenburg gave in.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Despite his appreciation of the Nazi menace, von Papen
rigorously proceeded to conduct negotiations which resulted in
placing Hitler and the Nazi regime in power.</span> Following his resignation
as Chancellor on 17 November 1932 von Papen continued
as Chancellor pro-tem until 2 December 1932, when General
Schleicher was appointed to replace him (<span class='it'>2902-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost as soon as he vacated the Chancery, von Papen began
plotting to unseat his arch-rival Schleicher. On about 10 December
1932—less than a month after he was willing to use force
to suppress the Nazis—von Papen requested Kurt von Schroeder,
the Cologne banker, to arrange a meeting between Hitler and von
Papen (according to the statement of Schroeder, made at Nurnberg,
5 December 1945). Schroeder was one of a group of rightist
industrial and financial leaders who had previously been organized
by Hitler’s man, Wilhelm Keppler, to provide means of
bolstering Nazi economic power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler himself at this time understood von Papen. He knew
that Papen’s ideas were not too different from his own to preclude
agreement. He knew that Papen’s personal rivalry with Schleicher
would make Papen amenable to some agreement whereby
Schleicher might be unhorsed and Papen restored to a position of
public prominence. He accordingly asked Keppler to arrange for
a meeting with Papen (reported in an affidavit of Wilhelm Keppler,
executed at Nurnberg, 26 November 1945).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The result of these maneuvers was the now-famous meeting
between Hitler and Papen at banker Schroeder’s Cologne home
in January 1933. It was at this meeting that Hitler and Papen
reached an understanding, subject only to the ironing out of
minor details. It was at this meeting that Papen completely
committed himself to go along with Nazi policy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The events of this day have been described by Kurt von
Schroeder (in a statement referred to above):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“On January 4, 1933, Hitler, von Papen, Hess, Himmler and
<span class='pageno' title='923' id='Page_923'></span>
Keppler came to my house in Cologne. Hitler, von Papen
and I went to my den where we were closeted in a discussion
lasting about two hours. Hess, Himmler and Keppler did
not participate in this discussion but were in the next room.
Keppler, who had helped arrange this meeting, came from
Berlin; von Papen came alone from his home in the Saar;
and Hitler brought Hess and Himmler with him, as they
were traveling with him to Lippe in connection with the
election campaign. The discussion was only between Hitler
and Papen; I personally had nothing to say in the discussion.
The meeting started about 11:30 A.M. and the first question
was raised by Hitler as to why it was necessary to punish the
two Nazis who had killed the Communist in Silesia. Von
Papen explained to Hitler that it had been necessary to punish
these two Nazis, although they had not been put to death,
because the law was on the books and all political offenders
under the law must have some punishment. He further explained
to Hitler that it might be possible to get a pardon
from President Hindenburg to give serious consideration to
making Hitler the Chancellor at the time that Hindenburg
met with Hitler and von Papen and that he had understood
that Hindenburg was perfectly willing to discuss this matter
with Hitler at that time. He said that it came as a great
surprise and shock to him when Hindenburg was unwilling
to do so and he felt that someone, probably von Schleicher,
was responsible for the change in Hindenburg’s point of
view. Next, von Papen told Hitler that it seemed to him the
best thing to have the conservatives and nationalists who
had supported him join with the Nazis to form a government.
He proposed that this new government should, if possible,
be headed by Hitler and von Papen on the same level. Then
Hitler made a long speech in which he said if he were made
Chancellor, it would be necessary for him to be head of the
government but that supporters of Papen could go into his
(Hitler’s) government as ministers when they were willing
to go along with him in his policy of changing many things.
These changes he outlined at this time included elimination
of Social Democrats, Communists and Jews from leading positions
in Germany and the restoration of order in public
life. Von Papen and Hitler reached an agreement in principle
so that many of the points which had brought them in
conflict could be eliminated and they could find a way to get
together. They agreed that further details would have to be
<span class='pageno' title='924' id='Page_924'></span>
worked out and that this could be done in Berlin or some
other convenient place.</p>

<p>“I understand they met later with von Ribbentrop and
worked out further details.</p>

<p>“The meeting broke up about 1:30 and the three of us joined
Hess, Himmler and Keppler at lunch, during which there
was general conversation which lasted until about four
o’clock when they, all the guests, departed.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Having reached an understanding with Hitler, von Papen directed
his energy toward convincing President Hindenburg to
allow Hitler to form a new government. In this task he had to
overcome Hindenburg’s fears that this appointment would lead
to domestic oppressions and risk of war (according to a statement
of Otto Meissner, Nurnberg, 28 November 1945).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Von Papen himself subsequently admitted the important role
he played in bringing Hitler to power. At Berchtesgaden on 12
February 1938, immediately after Hitler had forced Schuschnigg
to sign the document which led to the Austrian Anschluss, Hitler
turned to Papen and remarked:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Herr von Papen, through your assistance I was appointed
Chancellor of Germany and thus the Reich was saved from
the abyss of communism. I will never forget that.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Papen replied:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='it'>Ja, wohl, Mein Fuehrer.</span>” (<span class='it'>2995-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<h3>C. <span class='it'>AS VICE-CHANCELLOR, VON PAPEN USED HIS POSITION AND PERSONAL INFLUENCE TO FACILITATE THE CONSOLIDATION OF NAZI CONTROL OVER GERMANY.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>In the first critical year and a half of Nazi consolidation
of control over Germany, von Papen was second only to Hitler in
the Cabinet which established the legal basis for furtherance of
the Nazi program.</span> As Vice-Chancellor, van Papen was the only
member of the government empowered to act for the Fuehrer in
his absence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Von Papen actively participated in the general abolition
of civil liberties by promoting legislation which paved the way for
the Nazi police state.</span> At the first meeting of Hitler’s Cabinet,
there was intensive discussion concerning the possibility of securing
passage of an Enabling Law which in practical effect
would liquidate the Reichstag and make the Nazi Cabinet the
supreme law-making power of the Reich. The conspirators, including
von Papen, at this meeting clearly indicated that they
<span class='pageno' title='925' id='Page_925'></span>
did not at the time hold sufficient power to achieve this measure
by normal constitutional methods (<span class='it'>351-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seizing the Reichstag fire as a pretext, the Cabinet forthwith
arranged for the suspension of those fundamental civil liberties
(including freedom of speech, press, assembly and association)
which would protect citizens who dared to oppose the plans of
the conspirators. The suspension of civil liberties was accomplished
by issuance of a Presidential decree, which presumably,
according to German usage, was proposed to the Reich President
by the Cabinet and countersigned by those Ministers whose departments
were involved (<span class='it'>1390-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2050-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>This basic law was only the first of a series which placed the
individual dissenter at the mercy of the Nazi state. As if to
underscore explicitly the basic policy behind this legislation, von
Papen personally signed the decree which implemented this legislation
by creating Special Courts to enforce its provisions. This
decree abolished rights, including the right of appeal, which had
previously characterized the administration of justice by the German
judicial system. It thus constituted also the first legislative
measure for the Nazification of the German judiciary (<span class='it'>2076-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The subsequent creation of the dreaded <span class='it'>Volksgericht</span> and the
wholesale Nazification of the German system of criminal law
was merely the logical development of these earlier steps. This
too was achieved by decree of the Cabinet in which von Papen
was Vice-Chancellor (<span class='it'>2014-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Von Papen actively participated in substitution of the Nazi
Cabinet for the Reichstag as Germany’s supreme law-giving authority,
notwithstanding his doubts as to the advisability of giving
Hitler such extensive power.</span> Von Papen actively participated
in the Cabinet deliberations concerning the proposed so-called
Enabling Act, and concerning the means by which it might be
made law (<span class='it'>351-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2962-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2963-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The enactment of this law deprived the Reichstag of its legislative
functions, so that legislative as well as executive powers were
concentrated in Hitler and his Cabinet (<span class='it'>2001-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Enactment of the law was made possible only by the application
of Nazi pressure and terror against the potential opponents
of this legislation, and by taking advantage of the Presidential
decree of 28 February 1933, suspending constitutional guarantees
of freedom. (See section 2 of Chapter VII on the Acquisition of
Totalitarian Political Control.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>As if to indorse the methods by which this legislation was
enacted, von Papen personally signed the Amnesty Decree of 21
<span class='pageno' title='926' id='Page_926'></span>
March 1933, liberating all persons who had committed murder
between 30 January and 21 March 1933 against anti-Nazi politicians,
writers, and Reichstag Deputies (<span class='it'>2059-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Von Papen participated in this program notwithstanding the
fact that he foresaw at that time the implications of granting to
Hitler the complete powers conferred by the Enabling Act. He
has so testified (in an interrogation at Nurnberg, 3 September
1945):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Q. After Hitler became Chancellor, when for the first time
did you have any doubts about the wisdom of having allowed
him to become Chancellor?</p>

<p>“A. Well, that’s difficult to say. I mean the first doubt certainly
I had when the Reichstag gave in to his request for
the law, to enable him to rule the country without parliament.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>Von Papen not only participated in the seizure by the
cabinet of supreme power for the Nazis, but as a member of the
cabinet participated in the systematic elimination of all potential
enemies of the Nazi conspiracy.</span> The Reichstag fire and the
ensuing suppression of civil liberties marked the beginning of the
destruction of all rival political parties. The immediate elimination
of the legally elected Communist members from the Reichstag
was merely the forerunner of the rapid and complete liquidation
of all political parties other than the National Socialists
(<span class='it'>2403-PS</span>; <span class='it'>1396-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2058-PS</span>; <span class='it'>1388-PS</span>). By these measures
the suppression of all democratic opposition became complete,
within one year of the time when von Papen was warning his
countrymen of the dangers of authoritarianism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having substituted the autocracy of the Hitler cabinet for the
democratic force of the Reichstag, the cabinet proceeded immediately
to enact a series of laws abolishing the states and coordinating
them with the Reich (<span class='it'>2004-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2005-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2006-PS</span>). The
enactment of these laws, which had been clearly indicated by
point 25 of the Party program, removed all possible retarding
influences which the German federal States might have exerted
against the overwhelming centralization of power in Hitler’s
Reich Cabinet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The importance of this step, as well as the role played by
Papen, is reflected in an exchange of letters between Reichs President
Hindenburg, von Papen in his capacity as Reichskommissar
for Prussia, and Reichs Minister Goering. The exchange occurred
in connection with the recall of the Reichskommissar and
the appointment of Goering to the post of Minister President of
<span class='pageno' title='927' id='Page_927'></span>
Prussia. In tendering his resignation, on 7 April 1933, von Papen
wrote to Hitler:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“With the draft of the law for the coordination of the states
with the Reich, passed today by the Reich Chancellor, legislative
work has begun which will be of historical significance
for the political development of the German state. The step
taken by the Reich Government, which I headed at the time,
is now crowned by this new inter-locking of the Reich. You,
Herr Reich Chancellor, will now, as once Bismarck, be able
to coordinate in all points the policy of the greatest of German
states with that of the Reich. Now that the new law
enables you to appoint a Prussian Prime Minister I ask you
to inform the Reich President that I return to his hands my
post of Reichs Commissar for Prussia.” (<span class='it'>3357-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>In transmitting this resignation request to President Hindenburg,
Hitler stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Vice-Chancellor von Papen has sent a letter to me which
I enclose for your information. Herr von Papen already
informed me within the last few days that he agreed with
Minister Goering to resign on his own volition, as soon as
the unified conduct of the governmental affairs in the Reich
and in Prussia would be assured by the new law on coordination
of policy in the Reich and the states [<span class='it'>Laender</span>].</p>

<p>“On the eve of the day when the new law on the institution
of Reich governors [<span class='it'>Reichs-Statthalter</span>] was adopted, Herr
von Papen considered this aim as having been attained and
he requested of me to undertake the appointment of the
Prussian Prime Minister, when at the same time he would
offer his full time services in the Reich Government.</p>

<p>“Herr von Papen, in accepting the commission for the Government
of Prussia in these difficult times since 30 January,
has rendered a very meritorious service to the realization of
the idea of coordinating the policy in the Reich and the
States. His collaboration in the Reich cabinet, for which he
now offers all his strength, is infinitely valuable; my relationship
to him is such a heartily friendly one, that I sincerely
rejoice at the great help I shall thus receive.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;'>“For profound reverence,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;'>“A.H.” (<span class='it'>3357-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The enactment of this legislation followed repeated declarations
in which Papen had warned his countrymen of the dangers
of the exaggerated degree of centralized authority which would
result from abolition of the federal system. These warnings began
before Hitler’s accession to power and continued by implication
<span class='pageno' title='928' id='Page_928'></span>
in the reassurances which Papen gave in February 1933 to
Bavarian political leaders who expressed their fears of Nazi centralized
authority (<span class='it'>Cuno Horkenbach, Das Deutsche Reich von
1918 bis Heute.</span> (The German Reich from 1918 until today) (Berlin
1933), p. 44). As late as 3 March 1933, in an election speech
at Stuttgart, von Papen warned that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Federalism saves us from centralism, that organizational
form which concentrically draws all the vital forces of a
people to one point, as a mirror will do with the rays of the
sun. No people is less suited for being governed centralistically
than the German people.” (<span class='it'>3313-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Less than one month after its seizure of the legislative power,
the cabinet of which von Papen was a member enacted the first of
a series of laws aimed at establishing firm Nazi control over the
entire civil service and judiciary (<span class='it'>2012-PS</span>; <span class='it'>1400-PS</span>; <span class='it'>1398-PS</span>).
Having been a public servant himself, von Papen was aware of
the far-reaching effect of these first legislative and administrative
steps in attaining full totalitarian control over the entire
governmental machinery of Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cabinet of which von Papen was a member embarked upon
a state policy of persecution of the Jews. The first organized act
in this program was the boycott of Jewish enterprises on 1 April
1933, which was approved by the entire cabinet. This was followed
by a series of laws beginning the systematic elimination of
the Jews from public and professional life in Germany. (See Section
7 of Chapter VII on the Program for Persecution of Jews.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>All these suppressive measures were in line with long-standing
basic objectives of the NSDAP to which von Papen had agreed
in his January conference with Hitler and von Schroeder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(5) <span class='it'>To complete its suppression of all rival influences, the
Cabinet of which von Papen was a member enacted a series of
decrees which strengthened the Nazi movement by conferring
upon it a para-governmental status.</span> Followers of the Party,
through a decree signed personally by von Papen, were granted
amnesty “for penal acts committed in the material revolution of
the German People, in its preparation of the fight for the German
soil” (<span class='it'>2059-PS</span>). The perpetrators of Nazi terrorism were thereby
placed above the law, and a pattern was established for the subsequent
handling of Nazi excesses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This cabinet enacted measures which gave legal protection to
the status and symbols of the Party and its formations (<span class='it'>1652-PS</span>;
<span class='it'>2759-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>This cabinet enacted a series of measures to assure the Nazi
<span class='pageno' title='929' id='Page_929'></span>
movement’s spiritual control over Germany (<span class='it'>2029-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2030-PS</span>;
<span class='it'>2415-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2083-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2078-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2088-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having first outlawed all political parties other than the
NSDAP, the cabinet of which von Papen was a member formally
decreed that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“1. After the victory of the National Socialistic Revolution,
the National Socialistic German Labor Party is the bearer
of the concept of the German State and is inseparably the
state.</p>

<p>“2. It will be a part of the public law. Its organization will
be determined by the Fuehrer.” (<span class='it'>1395-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Having granted para-governmental status to the Nazi party,
and having assured legal unity of the Party’s Fuehrer and the
Reich’s Chancellor, the Nazis next step was to combine in the
same person the Presidency of the German Reich. This was accomplished
by merging the offices of President and Chancellor,
by means of a decree signed by von Papen (<span class='it'>2003-PS</span>). An important
consequence of this law was to give to Hitler the supreme
command of the German armed forces, always a perquisite of
the Presidency (<span class='it'>2050-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(6) <span class='it'>Despite disagreements as to detail, von Papen fundamentally
agreed with basic Nazi objectives and publicly endorsed
the regime for which he shared responsibility as Vice Chancellor.</span>
Von Papen’s basic political philosophy was not so divergent from
Nazism as to preclude an easy bridging of the gap. In 1932,
while still Chancellor, von Papen had been willing to head a government
in which Nazism would be strongly represented. By
January 1933 he found it possible—as a price for his restoration
to a position of public prominence—to submerge his differences
with Hitler and to direct his energies to the installation of a Nazi
regime (see B above).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to his participation as a cabinet member in the
process of Nazifying Germany, von Papen’s devotion to the Nazi
cause was repeatedly demonstrated throughout this period by
public statements and acts both by himself and by Hitler. Thus,
as noted above in connection with his role in the elimination of
the <span class='it'>Laender</span> as a political force, von Papen wrote Hitler in April
1933, that</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“You, Herr Reich Chancellor, will now, as once Bismarck, be
able to coordinate in all points the policy of the greatest of
German states with that of the Reich,”</p>

</div>

<p>And Hitler on that occasion took notice of Papen’s services by
declaring that
<span class='pageno' title='930' id='Page_930'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“His collaboration in the Reich cabinet, for which he now
offers all his strength, is infinitely valuable; my relationship
to him is such a heartily friendly one, that I sincerely rejoice
at the great help I shall thus receive.” (<span class='it'>3357-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And again on 2 November 1933, speaking from the same platform
with Hitler and Gauleiter Terboven, in the course of the
campaign for Reichstag election and the referendum on Germany’s
withdrawal from the League of Nations, von Papen declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Ever since Providence called upon me to become the pioneer
of national resurrection and the rebirth of our homeland, I
have tried to support with all my strength the work of the
national socialist movement and its leader; and just as I at
the time of taking over the chancellorship have advocated to
pave the way to power for the young fighting liberation
movement, just as I on January 30 was selected by a gracious
fate to put the hands of our chancellor and Fuehrer into the
hand of our beloved field marshal, so do I today again feel the
obligation to say to the German people and all those who have
kept confidence in me:</p>

<p>“The kind Lord has blessed Germany by giving it in times
of deep distress a leader who will lead it, through all distresses
and weaknesses, through all crisis and moments of
danger, with the sure instinct of the statesman into a happy
future.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“Let us in this hour say to the Fuehrer of the new Germany
that we believe in him and his work.” (<span class='it'>3375-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>By this time as noted above, the cabinet of which Papen was a
member had abolished the civil liberties which were a condition to
any effective protest against Nazism, had sanctioned political
murder committed in aid of Nazism’s seizure of power, had substituted
itself for the Reichstag as Germany’s supreme law-making
authority, had destroyed all rival political parties, had enacted
the basic laws for abolition of the political influence of the
<span class='it'>Laender</span>, had provided the legislative basis for purging the civil
service and judiciary of anti-Nazi elements, had embarked upon
a state policy of persecution of the Jews, had legislated Nazi influence
into the cultural life of the German nation, and had taken
its first steps toward conferring a para-governmental status upon
the Nazi party and its principal formations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even after von Papen’s Marburg speech of June 1934, in which
he again showed some understanding of the dangers of Nazism,
he remained a pillar of Nazi policy and influence. Thus Hitler
<span class='pageno' title='931' id='Page_931'></span>
himself, in attempting to justify the Blood Purge of 30 June 1934,
tacitly admitted that Papen was still considered a loyal member
of the regime:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The allegations [of foreign newspapers] that Vice-Chancellor
von Papen, Reichsminister Seldte, or other gentlemen of
the Reich Cabinet had entertained connections with the rebels
is refuted by the fact that one of the first intentions of the
rebels was to assassinate these men.” (<span class='it'>Hitler Reichstag</span> address,
18 July 1934, as quoted in <span class='it'>Das Archiv</span>, Vol. IV, pp.
495, 507.)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The Fuehrer thus made a tacit bid for the continuing loyalty of
von Papen. Von Papen’s subsequent career demonstrated that
this was not a vain expectation. He left the vice-chancellorship
only to assume the new task of special emissary of the Fuehrer to
Austria. But before leaving, while still Vice Chancellor, von
Papen signed the decree combining the positions of President and
Reichs Chancellor on 1 August 1934, and on 5 August 1934 he
delivered the document—the so-called Hindenburg Testament—which
purported to confer the revered president’s dying blessing
upon Hitler and the Nazi regime (<span class='it'>Notice concerning delivery of
Hindenburg’s testament by Vice Chancellor von Papen, Das
Archiv</span>, Vol. V, page 648).</p>

<h3>D. <span class='it'>AS GERMANY’S MOST FAMOUS CATHOLIC LAYMAN AND AS NEGOTIATOR OF THE VATICAN CONCORDAT, VON PAPEN USED HIS POSITION AND PERSONAL INFLUENCE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CONSOLIDATION OF NAZI CONTROL OVER GERMANY AND IN NAZI PREPARATION FOR AGGRESSION.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Immediately upon Nazi seizure of power within Germany,
von Papen endeavored to weld German Catholicism into a powerful
body of support for the Nazi state.</span> When Naziism seized control
of Germany in January 1933, its relations with the church
were at a low ebb. The period of the Reichstag elections of July
and November 1932 was marked by certain widely circulated anti-Nazi
pronouncements of the German bishops, especially in such
Catholic papers as <span class='it'>Germania</span>, <span class='it'>Koelnische Volkszeitung</span>, and the
<span class='it'>Rhein-Mainische Volkszeitung</span>. These bishops discerned the fundamental
incompatibility between the Church and the Nazis’ own
declarations of State policy. They accordingly publicly stigmatized
the Nazi movement as anti-Christian, forbade the Catholic clergy
to participate in any ceremonies (such as funerals) in which the
Nazi Party was officially represented, refused the sacraments to
<span class='pageno' title='932' id='Page_932'></span>
Party officials, and in several pastorals expressly warned the
faithful against the danger to German Catholicism created by the
Party (<span class='it'>3389-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately upon seizure of power, the main concern of the
new regime was to liquidate political opposition. Achievement
of this objective was predicated upon the strategy of “divide and
rule”. A first step in this strategy was to convince conservatives
that the efforts of the government were being directed primarily
against the Communists and other forces of the extreme Left, and
that their own interests would remain safe in Nazi hands as long
as they would consent to refrain from political activity. The result
was a brief but active period of rapprochement between
Church and Party. Von Papen was a leader in this strategy. The
minutes of the Reich cabinet meeting of 15 March 1933 contain
the following notation in connection with discussions on the Enabling
Act:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Vice Chancellor and Reich Commissar for the State of
Prussia said it is of decisive importance to integrate into the
new State the masses standing behind the Parties. He said
that the question of coordination of political Catholicism into
the new State is of special importance.” (<span class='it'>2962-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Eight days later, speaking at the second meeting of the Reichstag
of 1933, on 23 March 1933, Hitler asked for adoption of the Enabling
Act. In this speech he declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“While the government is determined to carry through the
political and moral purging of our public life, it is creating
and insuring prerequisites for a truly religious life. The
government sees in both Christian confessions the factors
most important for the maintenance of our Folkdom. It will
respect agreements concluded between them and the states.
However, it expects that its work will meet with a similar
appreciation. The government will treat all other denominations
with equal objective justice. However, it can never
condone that belonging to a certain denomination or to a certain
race might be regarded as license to commit or tolerate
crimes. The Government will devote its care to the sincere
living together of Church and State.” (<span class='it'>3387-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The immediate effect of this assurance was action by the conference
of German bishops, meeting in Fulda on 28 March 1933.
This conference lifted restrictions imposed on members of the
church adhering to the Nazi movement. In a cautious statement
which placed full faith and credit in the Papen-inspired Hitler
assurances, the bishops declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The high shepherds of the dioceses of Germany in their dutiful
<span class='pageno' title='933' id='Page_933'></span>
anxiety to keep the Catholic faith pure and protect the
untouchable aims and rights of the Catholic Church have
adopted, for profound reasons, during the last years, an oppositional
attitude toward the National Socialist movement,
through prohibitions and warnings, which was to be in effect
as long and as far as those reasons remained valid.</p>

<p>“It must now be recognized that there are official and solemn
declarations issued by the highest representative of the Reich
Government—who at the same time is the authoritarian
leader of that movement—which acknowledge the inviolability
of the teachings of Catholic faith and the unchangeable
tasks and rights of the church, and which expressly assure
the full value of the legal pacts concluded between the various
German States and the Church.</p>

<p>“Without lifting the condemnation of certain religious and
ethical errors implied in our previous measures, the Episcopate
now believes it can entertain the confidence that those
prescribed general prohibitions and warnings may not be regarded
as necessary any more.” (<span class='it'>3389-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This action opened the door for mass Party adherence by practicing
Catholics. All those German Catholics who were inclined
to adopt Nazi political views and had hesitated only because of
the anti-Nazi attitude of the hierarchy hastened now to join the
victorious party of the “National Revolution”. This tendency
was marked by a tremendous and sudden burst of activity by the
so-called “bridge-builders,” who rushed to close the gap between
the Church and the Nazi State. Von Papen, who only a short
time before had been willing to use armed force to suppress the
Nazis, was foremost among these “bridge-builders”, who not only
claimed an ideological affinity between the Nazi system and the
alleged anti-liberal character of Catholic politics, but affirmatively
apologized for excesses of the State which even then had begun
to shock the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Existing agencies were used for this purpose. Thus, the Union of
Catholic Germans (<span class='it'>Arbeitsgemeinschaft Katholischer Deutscher</span>),
of which von Papen was president, insisted in its program
that the church, like the Nazi movement itself, was guided by the
leadership principle (Cuno Horkenbach, <span class='it'>Das Deutsche Reich von
1918 bis Heute</span> (The German Reich from 1918 Until Today) (Berlin
1935), pp. 436, 504). The same organization, in the course of
the election campaign which preceded adoption of the Enabling
Act, had bitterly criticized the Catholic political opposition to
Marxism and urged that Catholics “by all means vote unanimously
<span class='pageno' title='934' id='Page_934'></span>
the National Socialist ticket”, because “We Catholics do
not wish to be denied to march in the lead in this election campaign”
(Election Appeal, <span class='it'>Voelkischer Beobachter</span>, 23 February
1933, p. 2). Later, on the eve of the Nazis’ first anti-Jewish
boycott, this same organization played its part in the extensive
campaign replying to foreign newspaper reports concerning atrocities
committed against German Jews. On 1 April 1933 it published
through the Prussian News Service, an “Appeal to all
Christians”, viewing “with great indignation” this “irresponsible
campaign against Germany” which “continues in spite of official
German declarations and corrections”. This “Appeal” characterized
the foreign reports as “intentional lies and falsifications”
and “a reckless, crafty campaign of destruction conducted by the
Jewish world alliance and moneyed powers against the right of
self-determination of all peoples and against the entire Christian
civilization”. It called upon “the Christians of all countries, irrespective
of denominations, to form a world-wide front of defense
against that Jewish conspiracy disturbing the true peace”
(“<span class='it'>Appeal to All Christians</span>”, <span class='it'>Voelkischer Beobachter</span> (People’s
Observer), 30 March 1933, p. 2).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Notwithstanding the force of these activities, this Nazification
by existing agencies was not deemed adequate to the task of organizing
Catholic lay support. The result was the creation, in
early April 1933, under the sponsorship of von Papen, of a new
“Bund” of Catholic Germans called “Cross and Eagle” (“<span class='it'>Kreuz
und Adler</span>”) which made it its task “to contribute enthusiastic
devotion to the upbuilding of the future Reich” (Gerd Ruehle,
<span class='it'>Das Dritte Reich</span> (The Third Reich), p. 250).</p>

<p class='pindent'>This whole program of rapprochement between Church and
Party manifests the Papen “touch”—the same quality of handiwork
which had manifested itself in Hitler’s accession to power
and which later was to reappear in Austria: First, gentle hints
by Papen as to strategy, followed within eight days by reassurances
in Hitler’s Reichstag speech. Next, again following merely
by days, the formal lifting of the restrictions on Nazi membership
by the leaders of the Church of which von Papen was the most
famous lay member. Finally, again within a few days, the open
campaign by which Papen-sponsored organizations endeavoured
to align Church and Party. The close timing of these events was
not a coincidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Having achieved initial successes in consolidating Catholic
support within Germany, von Papen undertook international consolidation
of Nazi-Church relationships by negotiation of a Concordat
<span class='pageno' title='935' id='Page_935'></span>
with the Vatican.</span> The program of rapprochement and
the public declarations bridging the gap between the Church
and the Nazi movement were merely advertising media by which
Nazi-minded Catholics were herded into the movement, and
slogans by which the conspirators might placate the Catholic
hierarchy. Throughout this period there continued an undercurrent
of anti-Catholic activity. A thorough job was done in
purging Reich, state, and municipal administrations of officials
appointed for their adherence to the Centre or Bavarian People’s
parties. Former leaders of those parties, including priests, joined
Communists and Social Democrats in the concentration camps,
and the campaign of hatred against the “black” was resumed.
By April 1933 the bishops were making appeals for clemency
toward former civil servants, who, they pointed out, were not
able to join the celebration of national awakening because they
had been dismissed from positions in which they had given their
best to the community of the German people. And on 31 May
1933, a meeting of the Bavarian bishops adopted a solemn statement
directed against the tendency of attributing to the State
alone the right of educating, organizing, and leading ideologically
the German youth (<span class='it'>Dismissal of Catholics</span>, Excerpts from
<span class='it'>Voelkischer Beobachter</span>, February-March 1933; <span class='it'>Excerpt, Voelkischer
Beobachter</span>, 19 April 1933 (Munich ed.), p. 2).</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this maintenance of a certain amount of pressure against
Catholic interests, the hierarchy was reminded of the dangers of
not coming to a definite agreement with the Nazi State. The
stage was thus set for von Papen’s negotiation of a Concordat
with the Vatican.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the time of these activities, the government of which von
Papen was Vice Chancellor had already launched its program to
mold the state machinery into the Nazi image. The Enabling Act
had become law, and the general outlines of the Nazi State were
already manifest. Notwithstanding the doubts created in his
mind by Hitler’s insistence upon the Enabling Act, von Papen
undertook negotiations with the Vatican. In fact, he since has
claimed that these fears gave rise to the negotiation of the Concordat
(Interrogation at Nurnberg, 3 Sept. 1945):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I became alarmed, you remember, somewhere in June when
I went to Rome to negotiate a concordat because I certainly
feared that the particular powers of the Hitler Party would
create difficulties on the religious side. So that with the
consent of Hitler I went to Rome to make that concordat.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is clear, however, that these alleged fears of the Enabling
Act were not fears at all. They were merely an understanding
<span class='pageno' title='936' id='Page_936'></span>
of the threat they carried to all persons and instrumentalities
antagonistic to the Nazi system. Von Papen understood the significance
of these developments. What he actually feared was
that the rest of the world would also understand Nazi methods
and would erect barriers to the consummation of the plans of the
conspirators. The situation plainly called for a neutralizing of
these potential barriers to Nazi plans. One method of achieving
this result at that time was the negotiation of solemn agreements
whereby other powers would commit themselves to a policy of
non-intervention by either armed or moral force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When von Papen concluded the Concordat with the Vatican, the
political objectives of furthering the purposes of the Nazi conspiracy
were thus foremost in his mind. Even at that time, in the
first half of 1933, von Papen had in mind, in concluding this Concordat,
not only the consolidation of Catholicism behind the Nazi
regime within Germany, but also the psychological build-up of the
Austrians in preparation for Anschluss. Von Papen’s own words
eloquently characterize these manoeuvres (monograph entitled
“Austria” written at Nurnberg, 1945):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Although the ‘<span class='it'>Heimwehr</span>’ movement [in Austria] had
brought these patriotic elements together before this, and
had fought with them to free the country from strong Socialistic
pressure, yet they were armed only from the standpoint
of domestic politics and remained aloof from all ambitions
for a greater Germany. The cause lay mostly in the Catholic
nature of the country, and in the strong influence of the
clergy in political leadership. The Reich was considered
a bulwark of Protestantism, despite its twenty million
Catholics. The anti-clerical wave, which was dominant in
the Reich under the leadership of Prussia, itself led by
Socialists, appeared to have verified the fears of the Austrian
clergy. For in spite of Catholics at the head of the Reich—Wirth,
Marx, Bruening—the Centre Party had always put
through its cultural demands by logrolling with the Socialists.
There were at least two Socialist officials, university
professors or teachers for every Catholic appointee. In
contrast to the obviously badly functioning Weimar Constitution,
there was an effort in Austria, under clerical leadership
and with the strong support of the Vatican, to develop
into a corporate state.</p>

<p>“Those were serious obstacles on both sides. When, after
the seizure of power of the NSDAP in 1933, as the first
remedy against a new ‘<span class='it'>Kulturkampf</span>’, I safely concluded the
<span class='pageno' title='937' id='Page_937'></span>
Concordat of the New Reich with the Holy See, my thoughts
at the time were not focused only on the Reich. For a peaceful
evolution of the German-Austrian question it was of the
greatest importance that the doubts of the clergy on the
Austrian side be completely eliminated.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“It was my first purpose in the diplomatic field to deprive
the Austrian problem of its European character, and to
develop it gradually into an exclusively internal problem between
the Reich and Austria.</p>

<p>“It therefore had to be my primary aim to convince the
Vatican that a union could not endanger the Vatican’s interests.
A Concordat of the Reich with the Vatican had been
my first attempt to prevent religious difficulties arising from
Nazism’s revolutionary doctrine; the attempt had obviously
failed. Under the growing influence of his Party, Hitler
sabotaged the Concordat. Rome was deeply disappointed
and in the greatest excitement.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 20 July 1933 the Reich Concordat with the Vatican was
signed by von Papen as representative of the Nazi Government
of Germany. This instrument was an international treaty which
purported to give the church an official guarantee of all the
church rights it had sought. In addition it purported to confer
freedom for Catholic organizations, maintenance of parochial
schools, and preservation of the general influence of the church
on the education of the German Catholic youth. Among the 33
articles of the Concordat, 21 treated exclusively the rights and
prerogatives accorded to the church. Reciprocation consisted
only in a pledge of loyalty by the clergy to the Reich Government
and a promise that Catholic religious instruction would emphasize
the patriotic duties of the Christian citizen and insist on a
loyal attitude toward the Fatherland. Since it had always been
the practice of the Catholic church to abide by established governments
and to promote patriotic convictions among the faithful,
these stipulations of the Concordat were no more than legalizations
of an existing custom. They were no more than a guarantee
of goodwill betokening harmonious Church-State relations
(<span class='it'>2655-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>The signing of the Concordat was only an interlude in the
church policy of the Nazi Conspirators, which was a policy of
reassurances and repression.</span> The signing of the Concordat
merely marked the beginning of evasions and violations of both
its spirit and letter. The ink was hardly dry before it became
<span class='pageno' title='938' id='Page_938'></span>
necessary for the Vatican to complain about a false interpretation
of the text, made by the Nazi government in its own favour.
(See Section 6 of Chapter VII on Suppression of the Christian
Churches.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>By action taken only ten days after the signing of the Concordat,
and despite its provision for the continuance of the Catholic
Youth Association, simultaneous membership in the Hitler Jugend
and the Catholic Youth Association was forbidden, and the campaign
to smash the latter organization thereby commenced
(<span class='it'>2456-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>These first steps were merely a foretaste of a long series of
violations which were to commence almost immediately and
eventually to result in papal denunciation and serious excesses
committed against the clergy (<span class='it'>3280-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The continuing character of the conspirators’ church policy—and
of von Papen’s participation in it—is further revealed by
von Papen’s action of 19 September 1934, when, as president of
the Union of Catholic Germans (<span class='it'>Arbeitsgemeinschaft Katholischer
Deutscher</span>), he ordered dissolution of this organization.
By this time the Nazis were dropping all pretext that rival organizations
might be permitted to exist, and were well along in
their plans for the integration of all German institutions into the
Nazi system. The official published announcement of dissolution
is a revealing document:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Since the Reich Party Leadership through its department
for spiritual peace increasingly and immediately administers
all cultural problems and those concerning the relationship
of State and Churches, the tasks at first delegated to the
Union of Catholic Germans are now included in those of the
Reich Party Leadership in the interest of a stronger coordination.</p>

<p>“Vice-Chancellor von Papen, up to now the Leader of the
Union of Catholic Germans, declared about the Dissolution
of this organization that it was done upon his suggestion,
since the attitude of the national socialist State toward the
Christian and Catholic Church had been explained often and
inequivocally through the leader and chancellor himself.”
(<span class='it'>3376-PS</span>).</p>

<h3>E. <span class='it'>AS ENVOY AT VIENNA, VON PAPEN USED HIS POSITION AND INFLUENCE DELIBERATELY TO WEAKEN THE AUSTRIAN GOVERNMENT, AND PARTICIPATED IN THE POLITICAL PLANNING AND PREPARATION FOR MILITARY AGGRESSION AGAINST AUSTRIA.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Von Papen accepted appointment as envoy at Vienna
knowing he would “front” for a Nazi fifth column in Austria.</span>
In July 1934, the Austrian policy of the Nazi government of
Germany was in bad odor throughout the civilized world. The
historical record of this period was written in the newspaper
headlines of the day. A period of Nazi pressure and terror culminated
on 25 July 1934 in an attempted revolutionary putsch,
the murder of the Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss, in which the
German Minister, Reith, was implicated. (See Section 3 of
Chapter IX on Aggression Against Austria.) The situation
was such as to call for removal of the German Minister, Reith,
and for the prompt substitution of a man who was an enthusiast
for Anschluss with Germany, who could be tolerant of Nazi objectives
and methods, but who could lend an aura of respectability
to official German representation in Vienna. Hitler’s reaction
was immediate. He chose von Papen as quickly as he heard the
news of the Dollfuss murder. Writing of this event in 1945 after
his arrest by Allied authorities, von Papen dramatically describes
the Fuehrer’s response to the situation (monograph on “Austria”
referred to above):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Suddenly, at three o’clock in the morning, there was a loud
ringing of my doorbell. SS men demanded admission. My
son and I were of the opinion that I was going to be imprisoned.
We went to the front door armed with pistols.
Our suspicions were unfounded. The SS men declared that
they had come from the Chancellery with the order to put
through a telephone connection between Hitler and myself.</p>

<p>“Hitler was in Bayreuth and had been trying for hours
without success to get in touch with me. The connection
was made.</p>

<p>“Hitler started, ‘You know of course what has happened in
Vienna. You must go there immediately and try to set things
in order.’</p>

<p>“I replied, ‘I have no idea what has happened in Vienna. I
have just returned from the country and I don’t understand
what you want with me in Vienna. I am in the act of packing
my trunk to leave Berlin once and for all.’</p>

<p>“Hitler, highly excited, gave thereupon a short description
<span class='pageno' title='940' id='Page_940'></span>
of the dramatic events in Vienna which led to the murder
of Dollfuss, and continued, ‘You are the only person who can
save the situation. I implore you to carry out my request.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As a result of this telephone call, von Papen flew immediately
to join Hitler at Bayreuth. There it was clear that the
Nazi leadership feared international repercussions from their
Austrian policy and felt themselves in dire need of a respectable
“front” man. Von Papen has described this meeting:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“There I found Hitler and his entire entourage, excited as
an ant-hill. It was difficult to get anything approaching an
exact picture of the Vienna ‘<span class='it'>Putsch</span>’ and the role of Hitler’s
promoters. Even if one had come into this gathering in
complete ignorance of the different circumstances involved,
one could have gathered with one look that they had a very
bad conscience and now were fearing the consequences. From
the very first moment I was certain that the immoderate
policy of the Austrian NSDAP under the leadership of
Hitler’s condottiere, Habig, had led to this coup d’etat.</p>

<p>“This was, then, a few days after the 30 June, the second
bloody excess of the Party which had promised to bring
Germany by peaceful means to social tranquility, welfare,
and respect. It was obvious that both events had made a
deep impression on the entire world, and that the governmental
methods of the Party must damage most seriously
the political credit of the Reich”.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At this meeting it was Papen himself who drafted the letter of
appointment. This letter was a masterpiece of deceit, calculated
to conceal completely Hitler and Papen’s goal of annexation. It
stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“As a result of the events in Vienna I am compelled to suggest
to the Reichs-President the removal of the German
Minister to Vienna, Dr. Reith, from his post, because he, at
the suggestion of Austrian Federal Ministers and the Austrian
rebels respectively consented to an agreement made
by both these parties concerning the safe conduct and retreat
of the rebels to Germany without making inquiry of the
German Reich Government. Thus the Minister has dragged
the German Reich into an internal Austrian affair without
any reason.</p>

<p>“The assassination of the Austrian Federal Chancellor which
was strictly condemned and regretted by the German Government
has made the situation in Europe, already fluid,
more acute, without any fault of ours. Therefore, it is my
desire to bring about if possible an easing of the general
<span class='pageno' title='941' id='Page_941'></span>
situation, and especially to direct the relations with the
German Austrian State, which have been so strained for a
long time, again into normal and friendly channels.</p>

<p>“For this reason, I request you, dear Mr. von Papen, to take
over this important task, just because you have possessed
and continue to possess my most complete and unlimited
confidence ever since we have worked together in the Cabinet.</p>

<p>“Therefore, I have suggested to the Reichs-President that
you, upon leaving the Reich-Cabinet and upon release from
the office of Commissioner for the Saar, be called on special
mission to the post of the German Minister in Vienna for a
limited period of time. In this position you will be directly
subordinated to me.</p>

<p>“Thanking once more for all that you have at a time done
for the coordination of the Government of the National
Revolution and since then together with us for Germany, I
remain.” (<span class='it'>2799-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The actual mission of von Papen was stated more frankly,
shortly after his arrival in Vienna, in the course of a private
conversation with the American Minister, George S. Messersmith.
Mr. Messersmith has described this meeting:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“When I did call on von Papen in the German Legation, he
greeted me with ‘Now you are in my Legation and I can
control the conversation’. In the baldest and most cynical
manner he then proceeded to tell me that all of Southeastern
Europe, to the borders of Turkey, was Germany’s natural
hinterland, and that he had been charged with the mission
of facilitating German economic and political control over
all this region for Germany. He blandly and directly said
that getting control of Austria was to be the first step. He
definitely stated that he was in Austria to undermine and
weaken the Austrian Government and from Vienna to work
towards the weakening of the Governments in the other
states to the South and South East. He said that he intended
to use his reputation as a good Catholic to gain
influence with certain Austrians, such as Cardinal Innitzer,
towards that end. He said that he was telling me this because
the German Government was bound on this objective
of getting this control of Southeastern Europe and there
was nothing which could stop it and that our own policy and
that of France and England was not realistic.</p>

<p>“The circumstances were such, as I was calling on him in
the German Legation, that I had to listen to what he had to
say and of course I was prepared to hear what he had to
<span class='pageno' title='942' id='Page_942'></span>
say although I already knew what his instructions were. I
was nevertheless shocked to have him speak so baldly to me
and when he finished I got up and told him how shocked I
was to hear the accredited representative of a supposedly
friendly state to Austria admit that he was proposing to
engage in activities to undermine and destroy that Government
to which he was accredited. He merely smiled and said,
of course this conversation was between us and that he
would, of course, not be talking to others so clearly about
his objectives. I have gone into this detail with regard to
this conversation as it is characteristic of the absolute frankness
and directness with which high Nazi officials spoke of
their objectives.” (<span class='it'>1760-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Von Papen proceeded forthwith to accomplish his mission—the
maintenance of an outward appearance of non-intervention
while keeping appropriate contacts useful in the eventual
overthrow of the Austrian government.</span> Throughout the earlier
period of his mission to Austria, von Papen’s activity was characterized
by the assiduous avoidance of any appearance of intervention.
His true mission was reaffirmed with clarity, several
months after its commencement, when he was instructed by
Berlin that “during the next two years nothing can be undertaken
which will give Germany external political difficulties”. Every
“appearance” of German interference in Austrian affairs “must
be avoided” (<span class='it'>1760-PS</span>). As von Papen himself stated to Berger-Waldenegg,
the Austrian Foreign Minister:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Yes, you have your French and English friends now and
you can have your independence a little longer.” (<span class='it'>1760-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Throughout this period, the Nazi movement was gaining strength
in Austria without openly-admitted German intervention, and
Germany needed more time to consolidate its diplomatic position.
These reasons for German policy were frankly expressed by the
German Foreign Minister von Neurath in conversation with the
American Ambassador to France (<span class='it'>L-150</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Von Papen accordingly restricted his public activity to the
normal ambassadorial function of cultivating all respectable elements
in Austria and ingratiating himself in these circles—particularly
if they were well-disposed (but not too obviously) to
notions of Pan-Germanism. In these efforts he was particularly
careful to exploit his background as a former professional officer
and a Catholic (<span class='it'>1760-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, however, the Austrian Nazis continued illegal organization
in anticipation of the possibility of securing their
<span class='pageno' title='943' id='Page_943'></span>
objectives by force if necessary. In these efforts they were aided
by Germany, which permitted the outlawed Austrian Nazis to
meet and perfect their plots within Germany and with German
Nazi assistance; which harbored the Austrian Legion; which
made funds available to National Socialists in Austria; and which
established appropriate contact with them through the Reich
Propaganda Ministry and through “respectable” Austrian “front”
personalities (<span class='it'>1760-PS</span>; <span class='it'>812-PS</span>). (See also Section 3 of Chapter
IX on Aggression Against Austria.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Von Papen was fully aware of the existence and activities of
these groups, and of their potentialities in effecting an Anschluss.
Thus, in a report to Hitler dated 27 July 1935, entitled “Reflections
on the Anniversary of Dollfuss’ Death”, he reviewed the
activities of these illegal groups and concluded that National
Socialism could “certainly become the rallying point of all racially
German units beyond the borders”. In this report he declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Third Reich will be with Austria, or it will not be at all.
National Socialism must win it or it will perish, if it is
unable to solve this task.” (<span class='it'>2248-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These sentiments concerning the role of National Socialism
were something more than idle speculation. Von Papen knew
that the presence of the Austrian Legion in Germany in itself
produced incidents, and that the Austrian Nazi movement was
dependent on German support. He has so testified (at an interrogation
in Nurnberg, 13 October 1945). In fact, despite his
facade of strict non-intervention, he remained in contact with
subversive and potentially subversive elements within Austria.
Thus, in a report to Hitler dated 17 May 1935 he advised concerning
the Austrian Nazi strategy as proposed by Captain
Leopold, leader of the illegal Austrian Nazis (<span class='it'>2247-PS</span>). In
subsequent statements he has revealed his <span class='it'>modus operandi</span> in the
use of his embassy staff. This method provided him with an
opportunity to disclaim responsibility if these activities should
be questioned. Thus, his military attache, Mutz, “maintained
good relations with the Army circles which were inclined towards
National Socialism”. Von Papen’s all-around contact man with
the Austrian Nazis was a member of his staff, Baron von Kettler,
who “had always maintained intimate contact with a group of
young Austrian National Socialists who, as we both agreed, had
a conservative coating and fought for a healthy development
within the Party”. The practical effect of these contacts has
been clarified in questioning of von Papen (at Nurnberg, 8
October 1945):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * A. As I told you, I charged one of my younger
<span class='pageno' title='944' id='Page_944'></span>
people of the Embassy, von Kettler—he was made the go-between
with these Nazi people, to smooth them down and
talk with them. Personally I had not very much to do with
them.</p>

<p>“Q. Well, I know that. That is what you always said. But
the result of your time in Austria was that their interests
were furthered through your office. Whether you did it personally
or somebody working for you did it, I don’t think it
is too important for what we have in mind here tonight; do
you?</p>

<p>“A. No.</p>

<p>“Q. Now, isn’t it a fact that their interests were furthered
through your office, if not through you as an individual
during those years that you were there?</p>

<p>“A. Yes, I wanted to know about their doings, you see. I
must have been informed what was going on.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Conclusion of the Agreement of 11 July 1936 merely constituted
another step towards Anschluss.</span> Prior to 1936, sponsorship
of political subversion was not the only pressure applied
by Germany in its efforts to gain control of Austria. The German
Government in addition had placed certain economic barriers
against trade between German and Austrian subjects, the
most serious of which was the 1000 mark law, which crippled
the Austrian tourist traffic by levying a 1000 RM tax on any
German citizen crossing the border into Austria. The effect of
these pressures was to induce the Austrian Chancellor, Kurt von
Schuschnigg, to seek from Hitler an agreement to “lift the 1000
Mark barrier he had levied against Austria and reassure Austria
that he had no political designs concerning our state, Austria”
(<span class='it'>2994-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The result was the agreement of 11 July 1936 between Germany
and Austria, which was negotiated by von Papen as
Hitler’s representative. The published form of this agreement
provided:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Being convinced that they are making a valuable contribution
towards the whole European development in the direction
of maintaining peace, and in the belief that they are
thereby best serving the manifold mutual interests of both
German States, the Governments of the Federal State of
Austria and of Germany have resolved to return to relations
of a normal and friendly character. In this connection it is
declared—</p>

<p>“(1) The German Government recognizes the full sovereignty
<span class='pageno' title='945' id='Page_945'></span>
of the Federal State of Austria in the spirit of the
pronouncements of the German Fuehrer and Chancellor
of May 21, 1935.</p>

<p>“(2) Each of the two Governments regards the inner political
order (including the question of Austrian National-Socialism)
obtaining in the other country as an internal
concern of that country, upon which it will exercise neither
direct nor indirect influence.</p>

<p>“(3) The Austrian Federal Government will constantly
follow in its policy in general, and in particular towards Germany,
a line in conformity with leading principles corresponding
to the fact that Austria regards herself as a
German State.</p>

<p>“By such a decision neither the Rome Protocols of 1934 and
their additions of 1936, nor the relationships of Austria to
Italy and Hungary as partners in these protocols, are affected.
Considering that the detente desired by both sides
cannot become a reality unless certain preliminary conditions
are fulfilled by the Governments of both countries, the Austrian
Federal Government and the German Government will
pass a number of special measures to bring about the requisite
preliminary state of affairs.” (<span class='it'>TC-22</span>).</p>

</div>

<p>More interesting was the secret part of this agreement, the most
important provisions of which have been summarized by Mr.
Messersmith:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Austria would (1) appoint a number of individuals enjoying
the Chancellor’s confidence but friendly to Germany to
positions in the Cabinet; (2) would devise means to give the
‘National opposition’ a role in the political life of Austria
and within the framework of the Patriotic Front, and (3)
would amnesty all Nazis save those convicted of the most
serious offenses.” (<span class='it'>1760-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Especially interesting was the manner in which this agreement
contained German economic concessions and further solemn assurances
regarding Austrian independence and integrity, on the
one hand, alongside far-reaching political concessions to the
Nazi movement (<span class='it'>2994-PS</span>). The effect was to place Austria
completely at the mercy of German good faith. Von Papen has
correctly described it (in an interrogation at Nurnberg, 8 October
1945) as “the first step” toward preparation for Anschluss, notwithstanding
his clear understanding at the time that the Austrian
government desired and intended to retain its independence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Germans lost no time in making the most of their new
opportunities, solemn assurances notwithstanding. The agreement
<span class='pageno' title='946' id='Page_946'></span>
merely heralded a new era in “legitimizing” the German
fifth column in Austria. Thus, the immediate amnesty to political
prisoners in itself presented serious police problems. The
freedom granted to political demonstrations and organization by
German Nazis made it difficult to police the propagandizing of
Austrians. And the agreement specifically gave the German
Nazis an opening wedge to representation in the Austrian government.
The terroristic activities and pressure of the illegal
Nazis continued without interruption under German sponsorship,
until their hand was strengthened to the point of openly
asking for official recognition (<span class='it'>812-PS</span>; <span class='it'>1760-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2994-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The importance of this agreement to the Germans was underscored
by the promotion of its negotiator from <span class='it'>Gesandter</span> to
<span class='it'>Botschafter</span>, at the time of its signing (Announcement, <span class='it'>Das
Archiv</span>, XXVIII, p. 571).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Von Papen himself participated in this pressure game by
maintaining contact with the illegal Nazis, by trying to influence
appointments to strategic cabinet positions, and by attempting
to secure official recognition of Nazi “front” organizations. Reporting
to Hitler shortly after conclusion of the 11 July 1936
agreement, he succinctly summarized his program for “normalizing”
Austro-German relations under the regime of the new
agreement:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The progress of normalizing relations with Germany at the
present time is obstructed by the continued persistence of
the Ministry of Security, occupied by the old anti-National
Socialistic officials. Changes in personnel are therefore of
utmost importance. But they are definitely not to be expected
prior to the conference on the abolishing of the Control
of Finances [<span class='it'>Finanzkontrolle</span>] at Geneva. The Chancellor
of the League has informed Minister de Glaise-Horstenau,
of his intention, to offer him the portfolio of the
Ministry of the Interior. As a guiding principle [<span class='it'>Marschroute</span>]
I recommend on the tactical side, continued, patient
psychological manipulations, with slowly intensified pressure
directed at changing the regime. The proposed conference
on economic relations, taking place at the end of October
will be a very useful tool for the realization of some of our
projects. In discussion with government officials as well as
with leaders of the illegal party (Leopold and Schattenfreh)
who conform completely with the concordat of July 11, I
am trying to direct the next developments in such a manner
to aim at corporative representation of the movement in the
<span class='pageno' title='947' id='Page_947'></span>
fatherland front [<span class='it'>Vaterlaendischen Front</span>] but nevertheless
refraining from putting National-Socialists in important
positions for the time being. However such positions are to
be occupied only by personalities, having the support and the
confidence of the movement. I have a willing collaborator in
this respect in Minister Glaise-Horstenau.” (<span class='it'>2246-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This activity continued through 1937. In fact, by 14 January
1937 the negotiations with the Austrian Minister of Security
and the development of “front” organizations had proceeded so
far that “a very intensive crisis has arisen for the illegal party”
with respect to its future program. In urging a patient attitude
toward these problems, von Papen appeared less concerned with
the legitimacy of their position under the 11 July 1936 agreement
than with his fear that</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“a too strong and far-reaching connection (with a proposed
conservative ‘German Action’ front organization) would be
understood neither in our own ranks nor could it be of use
to the action itself.” (<span class='it'>2831-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>On the other hand when an Austrian cabinet minister failed to
show sufficient energy to suit von Papen’s purpose, he showed no
hesitancy, under the terms of his 11 July 1936 agreement, to urge
replacement by a more cooperative individual. Thus, von Papen
has summarized his efforts to remove the Austrian Minister of
the Interior (monograph “Austria”):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I had tried to persuade Schuschnigg to appoint another
minister to his cabinet beside Herr von Glaise, who was not
very active. The new minister was to act as trusted liaison
man between the two governments, able to work on innumerable
problems directly without diplomatic intervention. This
simplification would also bring the men on both sides of the
fence closer together.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>By the beginning of 1938, the Nazi hand had been so strengthened
in Austria, and the differences and misunderstandings regarding
the agreement of 11 July had become so serious and
frequent, that Chancellor Schuschnigg found it expedient to
accept von Papen’s invitation to meet Hitler at Berchtesgaden,
notwithstanding serious misgivings on the part of Schuschnigg
(<span class='it'>2995-PS</span>). Von Papen showed no hesitancy in extending this
invitation despite the fact that he knew Hitler’s “idea to swallow
Austria”, despite his knowledge of Schuschnigg’s distrust of
Hitler, and despite his own doubts concerning the value of
Hitler’s word. Notwithstanding the situation, he found it possible
even to urge Schuschnigg that Hitler was a man upon
whom Schuschnigg could rely. And in making these representations,
<span class='pageno' title='948' id='Page_948'></span>
he was fully aware of the extent of German rearmament
and of its possible use as a diplomatic pressure device (according
to interrogations, Nurnberg, 19 September and 8 October 1945).</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 11 February 1938, Schuschnigg left for Berchtesgaden to
meet Hitler. At this meeting the severest pressure was exerted
to extort far-reaching concessions from Austria, including reorganization
of the cabinet, appointment of Seyss-Inquart as Minister
of Security and the Interior, and a general amnesty to Nazis
convicted of crimes (<span class='it'>2995-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2461-PS</span>; <span class='it'>1544-PS</span>; <span class='it'>1780-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was at this meeting that Papen urged upon Hitler the appointment
of Seyss-Inquart as Minister of Security and the Interior
(according to monograph “Austria”).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thoroughly entrenched in the government, the Nazis were now
able to seize upon Schuschnigg’s plebiscite as an excuse to seize
power, and to call for military intervention by Germany
(<span class='it'>812-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2996-PS</span>). (See also Section 3 of Chapter IX on Aggression
Against Austria.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thereafter it was only a matter of hours before Austria became
a province of the Reich—by a law signed by von Papen’s
man, Seyss-Inquart (<span class='it'>2307-PS</span>).</p>

<h3>B. <span class='it'>SEYSS-INQUART USED HIS POSITIONS AND INFLUENCE SO AS TO PROMOTE THE NAZI SEIZURE AND CONSOLIDATION OF CONTROL OVER AUSTRIA.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Seyss-Inquart was a member of the Nazi Party and held
the rank of General in the SS.</span> Seyss-Inquart has admitted that
he became a member of the Nazi Party on 13 March 1938; that
he was made a General in the SS on 15 March 1938, and held both
membership and rank until 8 May 1945. (<span class='it'>2910-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seyss-Inquart, in a letter to Goering, on 14 July 1939, asserted
that he had been a member of the Nazi Party since 1931. The
following is an excerpt from that letter:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Until July 1934, I conducted myself as a regular member of
the Party. And if I had quietly in whatever form paid my
membership dues, the first one according to a receipt, I paid
in December 1931.” (<span class='it'>2219-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='958' id='Page_958'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In a voluntary statement signed by Seyss-Inquart, with the
advice of his counsel, he discussed his affiliation with the Nazi
Party as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I supported also the National Socialist Party as long as it
was legal, because it declared itself with particular determination
in favor of the Anschluss. From 1932 onward I
made financial contributions to this Party, but I discontinued
financial support when it was declared illegal in 1934.”
(<span class='it'>3425-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In contrast with the foregoing assertions of the defendant,
Seyss-Inquart wrote a letter to Heinrich Himmler on 19 August
1939 in which he confirmed the fact that he became a member of
the Nazi Party in 1931 and also stated that he continued his
membership in the Nazi Party even after it was declared illegal
in Austria. The following is an excerpt from that letter:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Concerning my membership in the Nazi Party, I want to
state that I never was asked to enter the Nazi Party but I
asked Dr. Kier in December 1931 to take care of my relation
to the Party. At that time I saw the basis of the solution of
the Austrian question only in the Party. I wrote this already
in the year 1929 to Dr. Neubacher to adjust his hopes which
he had put in the Austria-German Volksbund. After that,
I paid my membership fees and, as I remember, direct to
the Gau Wien. The payments were made even after the
party was forbidden. Some time later, I got in direct touch
with the <span class='it'>Ortsgruppe</span> in Dornbach. The membership fees
were paid by my wife but the Blockwart couldn’t possibly
have any doubt that those payments were for my wife and
myself since the amount of the fees, S 40 [40 Schillings] a
month, was a sure indication of this fact and I was treated
in every respect as a Party member. Besides that, I was,
since 1932, a member of the <span class='it'>Steirischen Heimatschutzes
Kammerhofer</span>. In this organization I made every effort to
absorb the <span class='it'>Steirische Heimatschutz</span> in the Party and mainly
on account of my efforts, von Habicht declared that the
members of the <span class='it'>Steirische Heimatschutz</span> were members of
the Party. That proves that I felt myself, in every respect,
as a member of the Party and I was regarded as belonging
to the Party and as I said before, already in December
1931.” (<span class='it'>3271-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Seyss-Inquart, even before he became a member of the
Nazi Party, belonged to an organization conceived and founded
upon principles which later became those of the Nazi Party.</span>
<span class='pageno' title='959' id='Page_959'></span>
Seyss-Inquart has stated in writing that he had been a member
of a secret organization known as the “German Brotherhood”
(<span class='it'>Deutsche Gemeinschaft</span>). This is evidenced by the following
excerpts from his letter to Himmler of 19 August 1939:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It must be known to you that at the time of the Black-Red
Coalition, there existed an extremely secret organization
under the name of ‘German Community.’ Here met all sorts
of Nationalists and Catholic elements who, at least at that
time, were anti-Semitic and anti-Marxists. Dr. Doelter,
who was my office chief, was one of the leaders of this association
and through him I came into this movement. Dolfuss
was also active here. He was of my age and was a very
active anti-Semitic. It is through success of the activities of
this organization that the Black-Red Coalition was broken
and the Marxists never came back in the government. After
the establishment of National Socialism, this organization
was dissolved.” (<span class='it'>3271-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The secret organization, “German Brotherhood”, (<span class='it'>Deutsche
Gemeinschaft</span>), was organized to promote the anti-Semitic and
anti-Free Mason doctrines later adopted by the Nazi Party. This
fact is evidenced by Seyss-Inquart’s copy of the minutes of a
meeting of this organization on 28 December 1918 and by its
constitution and by-laws, a portion of which appear in the following
quotation:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The purpose of this organization is the liberation of the German
people from Jewish influences, and combat against
Jewry with all available means. The organization is secret.
Since a contact of the organization with the public can’t be
avoided it has to be done under pretense of unsuspicious purposes
and without showing the actual set-up.” (<span class='it'>3400-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>New members of this organization were required to make a sworn
statement, i.e.:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“As a German man, I assure with my honor, as far as I know,
there is no Jewish blood in my descendency. Furthermore, I
am not connected by marriage with a wife or other companion
of Jewish descendency, and I never will have relation
with one of those. I am not a Free Mason, I assure to be forever
a good member of the Deutsche Gemeinschaft and I will
always represent the interest of the German people against
the Jewish people and I am willing to fight the Jewish people
with all my power, any place and at any time. I promise to
obey all orders and decrees of the leadership of the organization
and to preserve complete secrecy about their institution,
<span class='pageno' title='960' id='Page_960'></span>
about the persons of the organization, and the events within
it, as long as I live.” (<span class='it'>3400-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>New members were also asked the question: “In case you will be
accepted, are you willing to employ only Aryan physicians, attorneys,
and businessmen?” (<span class='it'>3400-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Seyss-Inquart, after the Austrian Nazi Party was declared
illegal in July 1934, posed as a non-member of the Nazi Party but
continued to support it in its activities, principles, and objectives
in a subversive manner.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Seyss-Inquart has stated that:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Before the Anschluss, I worked for the legal, political activities
of the Austrian Socialists under the conditions laid down
in the Austrian Constitution. * * * From 1932 onwards
I made financial contributions to this party but I discontinued
financial support when it was declared illegal in 1934. From
July 1934 until the year 1936 I supported individual National
Socialists as lawyer and in collaboration with the welfare
work Langoth in Linz. From July 1936 onwards, I endeavored
to help the National Socialists to regain their legal status
and finally to participate in the Austrian Government.
* * * I was sympathetic towards the efforts of the Austrian
Nazi Party to gain political power and corresponding
influence because they were in favor of the Anschluss. * * *
On 10 March 1938 I suggested to Chancellor Schuschnigg, as
a solution to the difficulties resulting from his plebiscite plan,
that the National Socialists be appointed to the Cabinet, after
I became in May 1937 State Councillor and then on 16-2-1938
Minister of Interior and Security.” (<span class='it'>3425-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Seyss-Inquart was an official in the Austrian Government, yet
he rendered services, and physical and moral support to the illegal
Austrian Nazi Party during those years, knowing that the radical
elements engaged in terroristic acts.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“During this time, particularly after the Party was forbidden
in July 1934, I knew that the radical element of the Party
was engaged in terroristic activities, such as the attacks on
railroads, bridges, telephone communications, etc. I knew
that the governments of both Chancellors Dolfuss and
Schuschnigg, although they held the same total German viewpoint
in principle, were opposed to the Anschluss then because
of the National Socialist regime in the Reich. I was
sympathetic towards the efforts of the Austrian Nazi Party
to gain political power and corresponding influence, because
they were in favor of the Anschluss. On the day of the unsuccessful
<span class='pageno' title='961' id='Page_961'></span>
‘putsch,’ 25 July 1934, I was at my home in Stannern
near Iglau, Czechoslovakia. I learned later that the
murder of Chancellor Dolfuss on that day was the outcome
of a ‘putsch’ plan, in which SS circles were mainly involved,
to arrest the Chancellor and put in an Austrian government
with National Socialist participation. Eight or ten days before
this unsuccessful ‘putsch’ Chancellor Dolfuss sent for
me. We discussed the disturbances and troubled state of affairs
created in Austria by the radical element of the Austrian
National Socialists. I advised Chancellor Dolfuss to
make an arrangement with Hitler because the Austrian National
Socialists and even this radical element would obey
Hitler’s orders. I conjectured—later I found confirmation—that
these terroristic activities had a certain support from
the Reich. Chancellor Dolfuss told me he would think the
matter over and made a tentative future appointment for a
further discussion. I informed among others, also acquaintances,
of this conversation whom I knew had influence among
the Austrian National Socialists. About one week later Chancellor
Dolfuss informed me that at the moment he had no
time for further discussion.” (<span class='it'>3425-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>Seyss-Inquart derived personal benefits and political
power as the result of the subversive manipulations and terroristic
activities of his fellow Nazi collaborators.</span> He was appointed
State Councillor of Austria in May 1937, and Minister of the Interior
and Security of that country as the direct result of Nazi
manipulation. These facts he has admitted:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“My appointment as State Councillor was the result of an
agreement between Austria and Germany on 11-7-1936. My
appointment as Minister of the Interior and Security was one
of the results of the conference between Chancellor Schuschnigg
and Hitler at Berchtesgaden on 12-2-1938.” (<span class='it'>3425-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Another result of the Berchtesgaden conference was that Austrian
Nazis were thereafter allowed openly to demonstrate their
conviction, an advantage which they exploited to the full.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Austrian National Socialists must certainly have taken
my appointment as Minister of Interior and Security as an
indication of their right to activity. Still more, however, the
outcome of the agreement of 12-2-1938 allowed them to
demonstrate their convictions. This right they utilized in
more and more widespread demonstrations.” (<span class='it'>3425-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(5) <span class='it'>Seyss-Inquart used his affiliation with the Nazis to promote
<span class='pageno' title='962' id='Page_962'></span>
the absorption of Austria into the Greater German Reich,
according to plan as conceived by his fellow Nazi conspirators.</span>
Seyss-Inquart had had a continuous and constant interest in the
union of Austria and Germany for twenty years, and during all
that time worked, planned, and collaborated with others until the
union became an accomplished fact.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In 1918 I became interested in the Anschluss of Austria with
Germany. From that year on I worked, planned, and collaborated
with others of a like mind to bring about a union.
* * * It was my desire to effect this union of the two
countries—in an evolutionary manner and by legal means.
Among my Austrian collaborators were Dr. Neubacher, City
Councillor Speiser, the University Professor Hugelmann, and
Dr. Wilhelm Bauer, Professor Wettstein and others. Later,
during the rise of National Socialism, Dr. Friedrich Rainer,
Dr. Jury, Glaise-Horstenau, Major Klausner, Dr. Muehlmann,
Globotschnigg, and others. * * * After I became State
Councillor, I discussed several times with von Papen, the German
Ambassador, the possibilities of an understanding between
the Austrian government and the Austrian National
Socialists, respectively the Reich. We did not talk of the Anschluss
as an actual program. However, we were both of the
opinion that a successful understanding would bring about
in the course of time the Anschluss by evolutionary means in
some form. The last time I spoke to von Papen was in January
1938 in Garmisch where I met him by chance.” (<span class='it'>3425-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Seyss-Inquart contributed his efforts to revive the Austrian
Nazi Party after the unsuccessful “putsch” of July 25, 1934, and
to provide relief for the families of arrested and condemned Nazis.
He has described these activities in the following words:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The effect of the ‘Putsch’ was a complete catastrophe to the
National Socialist Camp. Not merely the leaders, but party
members were arrested in so far as they did not escape; the
confiscation of their fortunes was announced; the revolt
which led to military actions in Steiriermark, Karnten and
Oberoesterreich did cost victims; the political management
was seriously compromised by the Nazis and above all, a most
sinister looking situation was created in regard to foreign
politics. In any case, the idea of a union had suffered a severe
setback. I was in agreement about the effect with Dr.
Neubacher, and it was our desire to assist easing the tension.
Following this situation I felt urged to take up politics beyond
the question of the ‘Anschluss.’ * * * The former
<span class='pageno' title='963' id='Page_963'></span>
National delegate to the ‘Langoth’ in Linz was working with
Rheintaller. Dr. Neubacher and myself contacted this circle
and met there some other men whose names I have forgotten,
but who later did not play a particular role. After some time,
the lawyer applicant from Linz, Dr. Kaltenbrunner, joined
this circle. He was said to be an SS man. The main activities
consisted in organizing an institution to succor the needy
families of those arrested and condemned Nazis. * * *
As matters calmed down, the Austrian National Socialists
collected themselves again into an illegal party, the organization
was built up for better or worse according to the old
schedule, those who returned from the Reich were considered
to be more ‘in the know’ and authoritative. The institution
of succor, ‘Langoth,’ remained outside the party organization.
But here were also men in the Nazi circles who considered an
absolute dependence on the Reich as politically wrong and endeavored
for an independent Austrian National Socialist
Party. In effect, Dr. Rainer from Karnten belonged to those,
and by his influence the future Gauleiter Klausner who is now
dead; also Globotschnigg was in it, though I doubt he was
sincerely convinced, and also others. Dr. Neubacher took a
keener interest in political affairs and entered into relationship
with the proper Party circles.” (<span class='it'>3254-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The defendant submitted his plans to Hitler, Hess, and Goering
for their approval, and contacted other German Nazis.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“After my appointment as State Councillor, Wilhelm Keppler,
the German Secretary of State for Austrian affairs, arranged
a visit for me with Hess and Goering. I explained my intentions
and plans to them, namely, the attainment of the
legal activity for the Austrian National Socialist, independent
of the Reich Party. Hess expressed his interest and said
to me among other things: he regretted that I was not one of
the original ‘old fighters.’ I believe that at that time Goering
had already established direct connections with the Austrian
State Secretary, Guido Schmid. After my appointment as
Minister of Interior and Security of Austria, I went to Berlin
to visit Hitler. I arrived in Berlin on 17-2-1938 where
I was met by Keppler who took me to Himmler. This visit
was not anticipated in my program. Himmler wanted to talk
over police matters, I informed him, however, that I was not
conversant to speak about them. I did not follow the suggestions
which he made. I greeted Hitler with raised hand—permissible
after the agreement of 12-2—advised him, however,
<span class='pageno' title='964' id='Page_964'></span>
immediately that as Austrian Minister, my responsibility
lay with Austria. I explained to Hitler my plans,
namely: I was to be the living guaranty for Dr. Schuschnigg
of the evolutionary way. The Austria National Socialists
must only conduct their activities according to the Austrian
Constitution and on those lines find their way to the Reich;
they must not make any totalitarian claim nor conduct a
cultural struggle. The leadership of the Austrian National
Socialists must be independent of the Reich and remain responsible
to Austria. I would have, as Minister of Security,
to oppose any kind of illegal activity. Against this the Austrian
National Socialist would be permitted full freedom of
activity to work for the closest cooperation of Austria and
Germany. Hitler agreed to my plans but expressed certain
doubts whether Dr. Schuschnigg would be willing to go so
far. During my conference with Hitler, Keppler and Ribbentrop
waited in the ante-room of Hitler’s office.” (<span class='it'>3425-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Seyss-Inquart’s fellow Nazi conspirators regarded his position
as Councillor of State in the Austrian Government as most important
to them, because he had a mandate from the German
Nazis in power, which he was attempting to carry out. Because
his negotiations with Chancellor Schuschnigg seemed to be running
aground, Seyss-Inquart sent a report of that fact to Keppler
by courier, stating that he felt compelled to return his mandate,
and expressing a desire to discuss the matter before acting accordingly.
Keppler immediately sought advice from Goering in a
letter dated 6 January 1938. On that same day Goering’s secretary
was instructed to telephone instructions to Keppler to do anything
to avoid the resignations of Councillor of State Dr. Seyss-Inquart
and State Minister Glaise von Horstenau. Keppler received
this telephone message on 7 January 1938, and on 8 January
1938 wrote a letter to Seyss-Inquart informing him of Goering’s
instructions and relaying Goering’s request not to give up
the mandate under any circumstances without discussing the
matter with Goering. (<span class='it'>3473-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3397-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Despite assertions, in statements since his arrest and indictment,
to the effect that he desired a union of Austria and Germany
in an evolutionary manner and by legal means, Seyss-Inquart
has on other occasions made statements to the contrary.
His letter of 14 July 1939 to Goering is particularly illuminating
on this point:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I told myself in July 1934 that we must fight this clerical
regime on its own ground in order to give the Fuehrer a
chance to use whatever method he desires. I told myself that
<span class='pageno' title='965' id='Page_965'></span>
this Austria was worth a mass. I have stuck to this attitude
with an iron determination because I and my friends have
had to fight against the whole political church, and Free
Masonry, the Jewry, in short, against everything in Austria.
The slightest weakness which we might have displayed
would undoubtedly have led to our political annihilation; it
would have deprived the Fuehrer of the means and tools to
carry out his ingenious political solution for Austria as became
evident in the days of March 1938. I have been fully
conscious of the fact that I am following a path which is not
comprehensible to the masses and also not to my party comrades.
I have followed it calmly and would without hesitation
follow it again because I am satisfied that at one point I
could serve the Fuehrer as a tool in his work, even though
my former attitude, even now, gives occasion to very worthy
and honorable Party comrades to doubt my trustworthiness.
I have never paid attention to such things because I am satisfied
with the opinion which the Fuehrer and the men close to
him have of me.” (<span class='it'>2219-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Another statement of the defendant, which throws some light
on this point, is found in his letter to Himmler dated 19 August
1939:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“On November 8, 1938, the Fuehrer invited several political
leaders for supper. The Fuehrer asked me to be next to him.
We discussed the situation in Ostmark. I told him that in
accordance with his order, we started to dissolve the competence
of the Austrian government by giving the powers partly
to the Gauen and partly to the central leaders. But there still
would remain certain affairs which would be common for all
Gauen.” (<span class='it'>3271-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Furthermore, Seyss-Inquart has made the following statement:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I was happy that the Anschluss of Austria with the German
Reich had come at last after so many vain endeavors
since 1918 because I was in favor of the Anschluss of Austria
with the Reich under many conditions. I was aware at
least to a certain extent of the harshness of the National
Socialist regime, but I was of the opinion that these two German
countries belonged together and that the German people
should solve their own internal affairs and difficulties. I
was convinced that the harshness of the National Socialist
regime chiefly because of its achievement of the National
aim—cancellation of discriminatory peace treaties and
achievement of the right of self-determination—would in
time be surmounted.” (<span class='it'>3425-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='966' id='Page_966'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The subversive machinations of the Austrian Nazis to bring
about the absorption of Austria by the Greater German Reich
was described in detail by Dr. Friedrich Rainer, a leading Austrian
Nazi and a collaborator of Seyss-Inquart who became one
of Hitler’s Gauleiters, in a report prepared by him and forwarded
to Buerckel. A copy of this report accompanied by a letter of
transmittal was later sent to Seyss-Inquart by Dr. Rainer. In
substance, the report related how the Nazi party lost a parliamentary
battle in 1933, continued its efforts to force admission of
its representatives into the Austrian government, and finally flowered
into the unsuccessful “Putsch” of July 1934, which, in effect,
destroyed the Nazi organization. Following the unsuccessful
“Putsch”, Hitler liquidated the first stage of the battle, and instructed
Franz von Papen to restore normal relationships between
the two countries. Accordingly, a new method of political penetration
was adopted. The result was that Hinterleitner, an Austrian
Nazi got in touch with the lawyer Seyss-Inquart, who had
connections with Dr. Wachter originating from Seyss-Inquart’s
support of the July uprising. Seyss-Inquart also had a good position
in the legal field and especially well established relations with
Christian Social politicians. Dr. Seyss-Inquart came from the
ranks of the “Styrian Heimatschutz” and had become a Nazi
party member when the entire “Styrian Heimatschutz” was incorporated
in the NSDAP. The reason for utilizing Seyss-Inquart
appears in the following excerpt from the covering letter which
accompanied Dr. Rainer’s report to Reich Commissar Gauleiter
Josef Buerckel, dated 6 July 1939:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I think the main reason for the fact that the person of Dr.
Seyss-Inquart seemed to Hitler and to public opinion to have
stepped in the limelight in those March days, was that no
position existed in the party which one might have presented
oneself to the public, and that there was no man who had the
guts to let himself be presented. The actual reason was that
the party leadership had to remain secret during the whole
illegal fight, secret even from the Reich German public.”
(<span class='it'>812-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Thus it is clear why Seyss-Inquart was surreptitiously a member
of the Austrian Nazi Party after it was declared illegal in 1934.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Rainer goes on to report that full recognition of the party
leadership was given by Seyss-Inquart and also that the defendant
was in permanent contact with Captain Leopold, who became
a member of the staff of Hess. After Hinterleitner was arrested,
Dr. Rainer became his successor as leader of the Austrian Nazi
Party, and, on 16 July 1936, Dr. Rainer and Globocnik visited
<span class='pageno' title='967' id='Page_967'></span>
Hitler at Obersalzburg, where they received a clear explanation
of the situation and the wishes of the Fuehrer. Subsequently, on
17 July 1936, all illegal Gauleiters met in Anif near Salzburg,
where they received a complete report from Dr. Rainer on the
statement of the Fuehrer and his political instructions for carrying
out the fight. After the agreement between Germany and
Austria on 11 July 1936, Hitler appointed Wilhelm Keppler as
Chief of a mixed commission to supervise the execution of the
agreement. At the same time Keppler was given full authority
for the Nazi Party in Austria. (<span class='it'>812-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(6) <span class='it'>The activities of Seyss-Inquart and his fellow Nazi conspirators
and collaborators forced the then Austrian government
into a critical situation and a struggle for survival.</span> As the result
of the plans, maneuvers, and disturbances created by the Nazis
in Austria, Schuschnigg, Chancellor of Austria, accompanied by
his State Secretary, Guido Schmid, conferred with Hitler at
Berchtesgaden on 12 February 1938. Dr. Muehlmann was also
present but not as a member of the Schuschnigg delegation. At
this meeting the possibilities for military action by Germany
against Austria were demonstrated to the Chancellor. The ultimate
result was that Chancellor Schuschnigg had no choice but
to accept the demands of Hitler that the Austrian Nazi Party be
legalized; that amnesty be granted to Austrian Nazis already
convicted for illegal activities; and that Seyss-Inquart be appointed
Minister of the Interior and Security in the Austrian
cabinet, (<span class='it'>2995-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3254-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3425-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2469-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2464-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few days after the Berchtesgaden meeting of Hitler and
Schuschnigg, and immediately after his appointment as Minister
of the Interior and Security of Austria, Seyss-Inquart went to
Berlin for a conference with Hitler. Upon arrival in Berlin he
was met by Keppler, Hitler’s special delegate on Austrian affairs,
who took him to Himmler. After a short conference with Himmler,
the defendant was conducted to Hitler, to whom he gave the
Nazi salute and with whom he had a conference lasting two hours
and ten minutes. Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop and Keppler
waited in the ante-chamber during the conference. Seyss-Inquart
first offered Hitler an explanation for greeting him with the Hitler
salute, by saying: “I consider him as the Fuehrer of the German
people who led us out of the discriminations of the peace
treaties.” During the conference, he rendered a report to Hitler
concerning the Austrian situation since June of 1934 and presented
his own program for Hitler’s approval. Hitler expressed
his approval of the plan but told Seyss-Inquart that he doubted
<span class='pageno' title='968' id='Page_968'></span>
whether Chancellor Schuschnigg would be willing to go so far.
It seems clear that Hitler’s doubt concerning Schuschnigg’s approval
of the Seyss-Inquart plan referred solely to Seyss-Inquart’s
proposal to allow Austrian Nazis to “conduct their activities according
to the Austrian Constitution and on those lines find their
way to the Reich,” because all other portions of his plan had
previously been adopted as a result of the Berchtesgaden Agreement.
(<span class='it'>3254-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3425-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2484-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seyss-Inquart has asserted that, upon his return to Vienna
after his conference with Hitler, he reported to Chancellor
Schuschnigg the content of his discussion and urged the Chancellor
to make a decision about the Austrian National Socialist question.
He then attended rallies of the Austrian National Socialists
held in various places in Austria to inform them of the content of
his conference with Hitler. Two of the principal meetings were
held at Graz and Linz (<span class='it'>3425-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3254-PS</span>). Considerable doubt
is cast upon the truth of Seyss-Inquart’s assertions that he reported
the contents of his conference with Hitler to Chancellor
Schuschnigg and in public meetings of the Austrian Nazis, by a
statement contained in a letter written by Seyss-Inquart to Himmler
on 19 August 1939. The statement is as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I had a conversation of over two hours with the Fuehrer on
February 17, 1938, in which I explained to him my point of
view. I would only be able to make statements about the content
of this conversation if the Fuehrer would grant me permission.
I left this discussion as a very sincere man and
with a feeling of great happiness to be of help to the
Fuehrer.” (<span class='it'>3271-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(7) <span class='it'>Finally Chancellor Schuschnigg determined to go before
the people for a decision on the question of Austrian independence.</span>
Chancellor Schuschnigg planned to hold a plebiscite on that
precise question and fixed 13 March 1938 as a date upon which the
plebiscite would be held. The Chancellor took Seyss-Inquart into
his confidence and discussed the matter of the plebiscite with him.
The Chancellor requested Seyss-Inquart to keep the matter a secret
until noon of the next day, and the defendant promised to do
so. Thereafter, Seyss-Inquart prepared a letter to Schuschnigg
objecting to the plebiscite on constitutional grounds and alleging
that the manner in which the plebiscite was to be held would not
allow the Austrians to express their own desires. Seyss-Inquart
admits that a copy of his letter was delivered to Hitler in Berlin
by Globotschnigg. (<span class='it'>3254-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3425-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 9 March 1938, a meeting of the Austrian Nazis was held because
<span class='pageno' title='969' id='Page_969'></span>
they had learned, through an illegal information service,
that a plebiscite was to be held. Dr. Rainer describes this meeting
in the following language:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The ‘<span class='it'>Landesleitung</span>’ received word about the planned plebiscite
through illegal information services on 9 March 1938 at
10 a. m. At the session, which was called immediately afterwards,
Seyss-Inquart explained that he had known about this
information only a few hours, but that he could not talk
about it because he had given his word to keep silent on this
subject. But during the talks he made us understand that
the illegal information we received was based on truth, and
that in view of the new situation, he had been cooperating
with the ‘<span class='it'>Landesleitung</span>’ from the very first moment. Klausner,
Jury, Rainer, Globotschnigg, and Seyss-Inquart were
present at the first talks which were held at 10 a. m. There
it was decided that first, the Fuehrer had to be informed immediately;
secondly, the opportunity for the Fuehrer to intervene
must be given to him by way of an official declaration
made by Minister Seyss-Inquart to Schuschnigg; and thirdly,
Seyss-Inquart must negotiate with the government until clear
instructions and orders were received from the Fuehrer.
Seyss-Inquart and Rainer together composed a letter to
Schuschnigg, and only one copy of it was brought to the
Fuehrer by Globocnik, who flew to him on the afternoon of
9 March 1938.” (<span class='it'>812-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Seyss-Inquart himself admits that he attended this meeting,
which was held at the Regina Hotel, Vienna (<span class='it'>3425-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3254-PS</span>).
The defendant was informed at this meeting that he would receive
a letter from Hitler by messenger the next morning.
(<span class='it'>3425-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3254-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Early on the morning of 11 March 1938, Seyss-Inquart received
Hitler’s letter. He describes it as having contained several erroneous
statements and containing a demand that a decision
should be arrived at before noon; that in case of rejection the
Reich Government would denounce the agreement of 12 February
1938 and military action must be understood. According to Seyss-Inquart,
Hitler also gave expression to his belief that there would
be disturbances in Austria if Chancellor Schuschnigg would not
relent and that the Reich would come to the help of Austria if
Austria demanded so. Glaise-Horstenau arrived by plane in
Vienna early that same morning with the information that Berlin
was greatly excited and that military steps were in preparation.
(<span class='it'>3254-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3425-PS</span>)
<span class='pageno' title='970' id='Page_970'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(8) <span class='it'>Seyss-Inquart then proceeded to carry out Hitler’s orders
and to fulfill the plans made by himself and his fellow Nazi conspirators.</span>
Dr. Rainer in his report to Reich Commissar Gauleiter
Josef Buerckel, and in his covering letter dated 6 July 1939, related
his version of the sequence of events during this period and
described the precise role of Seyss-Inquart, as he viewed it. He
complained about the fact that Hitler and the general public
seemed to give Seyss-Inquart all the credit for the annexation of
Austria by Germany. The following quotation from this letter
and report is significant:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Soon after taking over in Austria, Klausner, Globocnik, and
I flew to Berlin to report to Hitler’s deputy, Hess, about the
events which led to our taking over the government. We did
this because we had the impression that the general opinion,
perhaps also Hitler’s own, was that the liberation depended
more on Austrian matters of state rather than the Party.
To be more exact, Hitler especially mentioned Dr. Seyss-Inquart
alone; and public opinion gave him alone credit for
the change and thus believed him to have played the sole
leading role.” (<span class='it'>812-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Rainer then proceeded to describe just what happened in
those critical days, and outlined the final instructions given by
him for Friday, 11 March 1938. He explained that three situations
might develop within the following days:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“1st Case: The plebiscite will not be held. In this case, a
great demonstration must be held.</p>

<p>“2nd Case: Schuschnigg will resign. In this case, a demonstration
was ordered in taking over the government power.</p>

<p>“3rd Case: Schuschnigg will take up the fight. In this
case, all party leaders were ordered to act upon their own
initiative, using all means to capture the position of power.”
(<span class='it'>812-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Seyss-Inquart took part in these talks with the Gauleiters.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“On Friday, 11 March, the Minister Glaise-Horstenau arrived
in Vienna after a visit with the Fuehrer. After talks
with Seyss-Inquart he went to see the chancellor. At 11:30
a. m. the ‘<span class='it'>Landesleitung</span>’ had a meeting at which Klausner,
Rainer, Globocnik, Jury, Seyss-Inquart, Glaise-Horstenau,
Fishboeck and Muehlmann participated. Dr. Seyss-Inquart
reported on his talks with Dr. Schuschnigg which had ended
in a rejection of the proposal of the two ministers.</p>

<p>“In regard to Rainer’s proposal, von Klausner ordered that
the government be presented with an ultimatum, expiring
at 1400 hours, signed by legal political, ‘Front’ men, including
<span class='pageno' title='971' id='Page_971'></span>
both ministers and also State Councillors Fishboeck and
Jury, for the establishment of a voting date in three weeks
and a free and secret ballot in accordance with the constitution.</p>

<p>“On the basis of written evidence which Glaise-Horstenau
had brought with him, a leaflet, to be printed in millions of
copies, and a telegram to the Fuehrer calling for help, were
prepared.</p>

<p>“Klausner placed the leadership of the final political actions
in the hands of Rainer and Globocnik. Schuschnigg called
a session of all ministers for 2:00 p. m. Rainer agreed with
Seyss-Inquart that Rainer would send the telegram to the
Fuehrer and the statement to the population at 3:00 p. m.
and at the same time he would start all necessary actions to
take over power unless he received news from the session
of the ministers’ council before that time. During this time
all measures had been prepared. At 2:30 Seyss-Inquart
’phoned Rainer and informed him that Schuschnigg had been
unable to take the pressure and had recalled the plebiscite
but that he had refused to call a new plebiscite and had
ordered the strongest police measures for maintaining order.
Rainer asked whether the two ministers had resigned, and
Seyss-Inquart answered: ‘No.’ Rainer informed the ‘Reichskanzlei’
through the German Embassy, and received an answer
from Goering through the same channels that the
Fuehrer will not consent to partial solutions and that
Schuschnigg must resign. Seyss-Inquart was informed of
this by Globocnik and Muehlmann; talks were had between
Seyss-Inquart and Schuschnigg: Schuschnigg resigned.
Seyss-Inquart asked Rainer what measures the party wished
taken. Rainer’s answer: Reestablishment of the government
by Seyss-Inquart, legalization of the party, and calling
up of the SS and SA as auxiliaries to the police force.
Seyss-Inquart promised to have these measures carried out,
but very soon the announcement followed that everything
might be threatened by the resistance of Miklas. Meanwhile
word arrived from the German Embassy that the Fuehrer
expected the establishment of a government under Seyss-Inquart
with a national majority, the legalization of the
party, and permission for the legion to return, all within
the specified time of 7:30 p. m.; otherwise, German troops
would cross the border at 8:00 p. m. At 5:00 p. m. Rainer
and Globocnik, accompanied by Muehlmann, went to the
Chancellor’s office to carry out this errand.
<span class='pageno' title='972' id='Page_972'></span></p>

<p>“Due to the cooperation of the above-mentioned people with
group leader Keppler and other officials of the Reich and
due to the activities of other contact-men in Austria, it was
possible to obtain the appointment of Seyss-Inquart as
‘<span class='it'>Staatsrat</span>’ [councillor of State] in July 1937. Due to the
same facts, the Chancellor Dr. Schuschnigg was forced to
take a new so-called ‘satisfactory action’. Through all this
a new and stronger political position was won in the Austrian
system. The National-Socialist Party became acceptable
again in the political field and became a partner
with whom one had to negotiate, even when it was not officially
incorporated into internal Austrian political developments.
This complicated political maneuver, accompanied
by the steadily increasing pressure from the Reich, led to
talks between the Fuehrer and Schuschnigg at the Obersalzberg.
Here Gruppenfuehrer Keppler presented the concrete
political demands of the fighting underground movement,
which he estimated according to his personal experiences
and the information he received. The results of these talks
were the right of a free acknowledgment of the National
Socialist movement on the one hand and the recognition of
an independent Austrian state on the other hand, as well as
the appointment of Seyss-Inquart as Minister of Interior
and Public Safety, as a person who will guarantee to both
sides the proper carrying out of the agreements. In this
way Seyss-Inquart occupied the key position and was in the
center of all obvious political actions. A legal base in the
government was won for the party. This resulted in a
paralysis of the ‘system apparates’ [Schuschnigg government]
at a time when a revolution needed to be carried out.
Through this, the basis for a new attack on the Schuschnigg
government was won.</p>

<p>“Situation: Miklas negotiated with Ender for the creation
of a government which included, blacks, reds and National
Socialists, and proposed the post of Vice-Chancellor to Seyss-Inquart.
The latter rejected it and told Rainer that he was
not able to negotiate by himself because he was personally
involved, and therefore a weak and unpleasant political situation
might result. Rainer negotiated with Zernette. Director
of the cabinet Huber, Guido Schmid, Glaise-Horstenau, Legation
Councillor Stein, Military Attache General Muffe, and
the ‘Gruppenfuehrer’ Keppler, who had arrived in the meantime,
were also negotiating. At 7:00 Seyss-Inquart entered
the negotiations again. Situation at 7:30 p. m.: Stubborn
<span class='pageno' title='973' id='Page_973'></span>
refusal of Miklas to appoint Seyss-Inquart as Chancellor;
appeal to the world in case of a German invasion.</p>

<p>“Gruppenfuehrer Keppler explained that the Fuehrer did
not yet have an urgent reason for the invasion. This reason
must first be created. The situation in Vienna and in
the country is most dangerous. It is feared that street fighting
will break out any moment because Rainer ordered the
entire party to demonstrate at 3 o’clock. Rainer proposed
storming and seizing the government palace in order to force
the reconstruction of the government. The proposal was
rejected by Keppler but was carried out by Rainer after he
discussed it with Globocnik. After 8:00 p. m. the SA and SS
marched in and occupied the government buildings and all
important positions in the city of Vienna. At 8:30 p. m.
Rainer, with the approval of Klausner, ordered all Gauleiters
of Austria to take over power in all eight ‘gaus’ of Austria,
with the help of the SS and SA and with instructions that
all government representatives who try to resist should be
told that this action was taken on order of Chancellor
Seyss-Inquart.</p>

<p>“With this, the revolution broke out, and this resulted in the
complete occupation of Austria within three hours and the
taking over of all important posts by the party * * *.</p>

<p>“The seizure of power was the work of the party supported
by the Fuehrer’s threat of invasion and the legal standing
of Seyss-Inquart in the government. The national result in
the form of the taking over of the government by Seyss-Inquart
was due to the actual seizure of power by the party
on one hand, and the political efficiency of Dr. Seyss-Inquart
in his territory on the other; but both factors may be considered
only in the relation to the Fuehrer’s decision on 9
March 1938 to solve the Austrian problem under any circumstances
and the orders consequently issued by the
Fuehrer.” (<span class='it'>812-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Seyss-Inquart’s own story of the events on 11 March 1938 is
not fundamentally different, although he does show a marked
tendency to minimize his role in the planning, precipitating, and
accomplishment of the annexation of Austria by Germany, in a
statement signed by him after his arrest and indictment:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“At 10 o’clock in the morning Glaise-Horstenau and I went
to the Bundes Chancellery and conferred for about two hours
with Dr. Schuschnigg. We told him of all that we knew,
particularly about the possibility of disturbances and preparations
by the Reich. The Chancellor said that he would
<span class='pageno' title='974' id='Page_974'></span>
give his decision by 1400 hours. While I was with Glaise-Horstenau
and Dr. Schuschnigg, I was repeatedly called to
the telephone to speak to Goering. He informed me, (the
demands of the Reich steadily increasing) that the agreement
of 12-2 had been cancelled, and demanded Dr.
Schuschnigg’s resignation and my appointment as Chancellor.
I delivered this information verbally to Dr. Schuschnigg and
withdrew from the conference.</p>

<p>“In the meantime Keppler arrived from Berlin and had a
conference in the Bundes Chancellery, I believe also with
President Miklas. The latter refused to concede to the demands
and sought to find various other solutions. When
Keppler arrived from Berlin he showed me the contents of a
telegram which I, as leader of the provisional Austrian Government,
was to send to Hitler and in which I was to request
sending of German troops to Austria to put down disorders.
I refused as I did not want to establish myself as head of a
provisional government, and there were no disorders in
Austria. Keppler repeatedly urged me about the telegram.
Around 6 p. m. I told him that he knew my standpoint and
should do what he wished with Berlin. Keppler, as I have
been able to confirm from records available, understood my
answer and did not send off the telegram at that time.
Around 7:30 p. m. a frontier police post announced that
German troops were crossing the frontier. Thereupon Dr.
Schuschnigg gave his well known farewell speech over the
radio. Upon requests from various sides I followed with a
speech over the radio, stating that I was still functioning as
Minister of Interior and Security, requesting preservation
of peace and order, and gave directions that no resistance
should be offered the German troops.</p>

<p>“As I am able to gather from the records available, I was
again requested about 10 p. m. to give my sanction to another
somewhat altered telegram, about which I informed President
Miklas and Dr. Schuschnigg. Finally President Miklas
appointed me Chancellor and a little while later he approved
of my proposed ministers.” (<span class='it'>3425-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>However, Seyss-Inquart displayed undue modesty in this statement.
His letter to Himmler indicates how active he was on 11
March 1938, and reveals that he was not satisfied with making
demands upon Chancellor Schuschnigg, but also handed an ultimatum
to President Miklas:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“It is only possible that Buerckel made a statement that in
the critical hours it was hard to find me. After I had handed
<span class='pageno' title='975' id='Page_975'></span>
an ultimatum to Miklas which was respited until 5:45 p. m.
I took a recess of about a half hour to catch some fresh air.
I conceded that I was, in a way, exhausted from the things
which happened just a few hours before that and I tried to
find recreation in the fresh air. Besides that I planned to
take a look at the situation on the streets. Furthermore, I
wanted to make a phone call to Berlin, not from the Chancellery,
but from some other place. Phone calls from the Chancellery
were always tapped whereas they were only sometimes
tapped from other places. I was sure they didn’t need
me until 5:30 p. m., because the men of the old system would
not make a decision a second earlier than they had to.”
(<span class='it'>3271-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A stenographic transcript of Goering’s telephone conversation
with Seyss-Inquart confirms the fact that Seyss-Inquart was ordered
to demand Chancellor Schuschnigg’s resignation and the
appointment of himself as Chancellor. (<span class='it'>2949-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>This stenographic record of Goering’s conversations also reveals
that Seyss-Inquart had an agent keep in contact with
Goering during the negotiations with Chancellor Schuschnigg.
Seyss-Inquart was given an order by Goering through this agent
to report by 7:30 p. m., 11 March 1938, that he had formed a new
government. He was informed that the foreign political aspect
would be handled exclusively by Germany and that Hitler would
talk with him about this matter at a future date. (<span class='it'>2949-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition the stenographic transcript of these telephone conversations
show that the selection of individual members of the
cabinet of the new government to be established by Seyss-Inquart
was to be made by the Nazi conspirators in Berlin. (<span class='it'>2949-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>At 1726 hours on the night of 11 March 1938, Seyss-Inquart
reported to Goering by telephone as ordered. He reported that
President Miklas had accepted the resignation of Chancellor
Schuschnigg but wanted to appoint a man like Ender to the Chancellorship.
He further reported his suggestion to the President
that the Chancellorship be entrusted to him—Seyss-Inquart—and
also reported that “We have ordered the SA and the SS to take
over police duties.” Thereupon Goering ordered Seyss-Inquart to
go with Lt. Gen. Muff to President Miklas and inform him that if
the demands were not met immediately German troops, already
advancing to the frontier, would invade Austria that night and
Austria would cease to exist. An audience with the President
was to be demanded. The invasion would be stopped only if President
Miklas entrusted Seyss-Inquart with the Chancellorship.
Seyss-Inquart was also instructed to call out the National Socialists
<span class='pageno' title='976' id='Page_976'></span>
of Austria all over the country, because Austrian Nazis should
even then be in the streets. Seyss-Inquart was to report again
at 7:30 p. m. (<span class='it'>2949-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The telegram, already prepared, asking Hitler to send German
troops into Austria, over the defendant Seyss-Inquart’s signature,
was transmitted as ordered and agreed upon. (<span class='it'>2463-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even before Seyss-Inquart received his appointment as Chancellor
of Austria he dispatched a telegram using that title. An
affidavit of August Eigruber states as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“On the evening of 11 March 1938 at between 8 and 9 o’clock
p. m. he received two telegrams; one of which came from
Dr. Seyss-Inquart, as Bundes Chancellor of Austria, and the
other from one Dr. Rainer; that the telegram from Dr. Seyss-Inquart
appointed the affiant as temporary <span class='it'>Landeshauptmann</span>
in Upper Austria; and that the telegram from Dr. Rainer appointed
the affiant temporary leader of the National Socialist
Party in Upper Austria.” (<span class='it'>2909-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Schuschnigg presented his resignation, which was accepted by
President Miklas. The appointment of Seyss-Inquart as Chancellor
came late on the evening of 11 March 1938. (<span class='it'>2465-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(9) <span class='it'>Having infiltrated into the Austrian Government of Chancellor
Schuschnigg according to plan, Seyss-Inquart exploited his
opportunities to carry out the plan to its ultimate conclusion,
i.e. German annexation of Austria.</span> The first act of Seyss-Inquart
as the new Chancellor of Austria was to hold a telephone
conversation with Hitler early in the morning of 12 March 1938.
He has described the substance of this telephone conversation as
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“During the morning of 12 March I held a telephone conversation
with Hitler in which I suggested that while German
troops were entering Austria, Austrian troops as a symbol
should march into the Reich. Hitler agreed to this suggestion
and we agreed to meet in Linz, Upper Austria, later on
that same day.” (<span class='it'>3425-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thereafter, on 12 March 1938, Seyss-Inquart greeted Hitler on
the balcony of the City Hall of Linz, Upper Austria. In his ensuing
speech, Seyss-Inquart announced that Article 88 of the Treaty
of St. Germain, which provided that “the independence of Austria
is inalienable otherwise than with the consent of the Council of
the League of Nations,” was no longer operative.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I then flew to Linz with Himmler, who had arrived in Vienna
from Berlin. I greeted Hitler on the balcony of the City Hall,
<span class='pageno' title='977' id='Page_977'></span>
and said that Article 88 of the Treaty of St. Germain was
now inoperative.” (<span class='it'>3425-PS</span>; <span class='it'>L-231</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In his memorandum entitled “The Austrian Question” Seyss-Inquart
describes his meeting with Hitler as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>“In the afternoon, I flew with Himmler to Linz and drove
then to meet Hitler. Hitler entered Linz in the evening. I
never saw such an enthusiasm. The welcome was spontaneous
and of no precedence. In my (welcome) speech I declared
that Article 88 of the St. Germain Treaty was no longer binding.”
(<span class='it'>3254-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2485-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Seyss-Inquart then drove back to Vienna on the morning of 13
March 1938. His Secretary of State for Security begged that he be
allowed to resign, a decision he reached as a result of a conversation
with Himmler, which had caused him to fear for his own personal
welfare. Seyss-Inquart then nominated Kaltenbrunner for
State Secretary for Security, and the nomination was accepted
by President Miklas. About noon State Under Secretary Stuckart
of the German Reich Ministry of the Interior brought a proposal
for a reannexation act uniting Austria to Germany, and announced
Hitler’s wish for prompt execution of it. Seyss-Inquart then called
a meeting of his Council of Ministers, and on his proposal the
council adopted the act. (<span class='it'>3254-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seyss-Inquart, realizing that if the President of Austria resigned
his office, then he, Seyss-Inquart, would be the successor,
went to President Miklas with the information about the action of
the Council of Ministers. Seyss-Inquart describes this meeting
with President Miklas as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the case where the Bund President would, for any reason,
either have resigned his functions or be, for some time,
impeded in fulfilling them, his prerogatives were to go over
to the Bund Chancellor, I went to the Bund President with
Dr. Wolff. The President told me that he did not know
whether this development would be of welfare to the Austrian
Nation, but that he did not wish to interfere and preferred to
resign his functions, so that all rights would come into my
hands, according to the Constitution. The possibility of my
dismissal or resignation were only slightly mentioned and
recognized as inopportune in the prevailing situation.”
(<span class='it'>3254-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>President Miklas then resigned and Seyss-Inquart succeeded to
his office. (<span class='it'>2466-PS</span>)
<span class='pageno' title='978' id='Page_978'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Thereafter Seyss-Inquart signed the Act uniting Austria with
Germany and hurried back to Linz to report this news to Hitler:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Then there were some letters exchanged between the Bund
President and myself, confirming our conversation and his
retirement. Thereafter I drove to Linz, where I arrived
around mid-night and reported to the Fuehrer the accomplishment
of the Anschluss Law. Hitler was very much impressed
by it; for a while he remained quiet, then tears dropped from
his eyes down his cheeks. He said then that he was especially
happy because his Motherland had achieved her annexation
to the Reich without any shedding of blood.” (<span class='it'>3254-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On 14 March 1938 Hitler entered Vienna. On 15 March 1938
there was a public demonstration in Vienna and Hitler introduced
Seyss-Inquart as “Reich <span class='it'>Statthalter</span> for Austria.” Hitler then
put him in charge of the Civil Administration of Austria, while
political matters were assigned to Gauleiter Josef Buerckel, who
shortly thereafter was made Reich Commissar for the Anschluss.
(<span class='it'>3425-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(10) <span class='it'>Despite Seyss-Inquart’s modesty since arrest and indictment,
his fellow Nazi conspirators recognized the importance of
his part in the Austrian Anschluss.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Goering made a speech in Vienna on 26 March 1938 in which he
said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“At this moment [announcement of the plebiscite in Austria]
it has been established that now the decision really came. A
complete unanimity between the Fuehrer and the N. S. confidants
inside of Austria existed. According to their opinion
also the hour of action had come, but they thought they could
not use any more democratic methods in negotiations and
they took the law of action in their own strong hands and
forced the others to retreat. If the N. S. rising succeeded so
quickly and thoroughly without bloodshed, it is first of all
due to the intelligent and decisive firmness of the present
Reichsstatthalter Seyss-Inquart and his confidants. But this
too proved the correctness of the previous continued politics
because if our confidants had not been in the government,
this whole course of events would not have been possible.”
(<span class='it'>3270-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>According to Dr. Rainer, Hitler and the general public gave
Seyss-Inquart credit for playing the leading role in the annexation
of Austria by Germany. This is evidenced by the covering
letter written by Dr. Rainer, dated 6 July 1939, to Reich Commissar
Gauleiter Josef Buerckel:
<span class='pageno' title='979' id='Page_979'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“We had the impression that the general opinion, perhaps
also Hitler’s own, was that the liberation depended more upon
Austrian matters of state rather than the Party. To be more
exact, Hitler especially mentioned Seyss-Inquart alone; and
public opinion gave him alone credit for the change and thus
believed him to have played the sole leading role.” (<span class='it'>812-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>In his report to Reich Commissar Buerckel, Dr. Rainer said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“But as a result of the agreement at Berchtesgaden and the
statement of the Fuehrer made to him during his state visit
to Berlin, Seyss-Inquart was the personal trustee of the
Fuehrer and directly responsible to him for the illegal
NSDAP in Austria within the confines of his political sphere.
* * * The seizure of power was the work of the party
supported by the Fuehrer’s threat of invasion and the legal
standing of Seyss-Inquart in the government.</p>

<p>“The national result in the form of the taking over of the
government by Seyss-Inquart was due to the actual seizure
of power by the Party on one hand and the political efficiency
of Dr. Seyss-Inquart in his territory on the other.” (<span class='it'>812-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Hans Frank recognized the importance of the services rendered
by Seyss-Inquart to the Nazi cause in Austria. When Seyss-Inquart
was about to leave Poland to become Reich commissar of
the Occupied Netherlands Territories, Frank extolled him as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“But your name without that is shining like a light through
the history of the Third Reich, since you are the creator of
the National Socialist Austria.” (<span class='it'>3465-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(11) <span class='it'>The Nazi conspirators within the German Reich evidenced
their intentions of annexing Austria in many ways.</span> Hitler,
on the first page of Chapter 1 of <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>, said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Today it seems to me providential that Fate should have
chosen Braunau on the Inn as my birthplace. For this little
town lies on the boundary between two German states which
we of the younger generation at least have made it our life
work to reunite by every means at our disposal.</p>

<p>“German-Austria must return to the great German Mother
Country, and not because of any economic considerations.
No, and again no: even if such a union were unimportant
from an economic point of view; yes, even if it were harmful,
it must nevertheless take place. One blood demands one
Reich. Never will the German Nation possess the moral
right to engage in Colonial politics until, at least, it embraces
its own sons within a single state. Only when the Reich
<span class='pageno' title='980' id='Page_980'></span>
borders include the very last German, but can no longer
guarantee his daily bread, will the moral right to acquire foreign
soil arise from the distress of our own people. Their
sword will become our plow, and from the tears of war the
daily bread of future generations will grow.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Seyss-Inquart devoted his efforts to legalize the sale and circulation
of <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> in Austria. His letter to Keppler, German
Secretary of State for Austrian Affairs, contained the following
passage.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The <span class='it'>Teinfaltstrasse</span> is very well informed even if not in detail
about my efforts regarding the re-permission of the book
‘Mein Kampf’.” (<span class='it'>3392-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Goering and Schacht both told an American diplomat that it
was Germany’s determination to annex Austria and Sudetenland
to the Reich. (<span class='it'>L-151)</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the missions of von Papen, as German Ambassador to
Austria, was to effect a change in the personnel of the Austrian
Cabinet headed by Chancellor von Schuschnigg and to eliminate
anti-Nazi opposition, particularly in the Ministry of Interior and
Security. (<span class='it'>2246-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German Reich applied economic pressure upon Austria.
One of the means adopted was the law of 24 March 1933, which
required payment of 1,000 Reichs Marks by every German crossing
the border into Austria (<span class='it'>3467-PS</span>). Kurt von Schuschnigg,
former Chancellor of Austria, in his affidavit of 19 November
1945, described this economic pressure upon Austria by Germany
in the following words:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * During my tenure of office as Federal Chancellor
of Austria, more particularly on the 11th day of July, 1936,
I negotiated with the then existing government of the German
Reich, and with Adolf Hitler, an Agreement more particularly
known as the Agreement of 11 July 1936.</p>

<p>“I further depose and say that prior to the consummation of
the aforesaid Agreement, the German Government had placed
certain economic barriers against trade between Germany
and Austria such as—to-wit—the 1,000 mark barrier which
said barrier provided that any German citizen who crosses
the border of Germany into Austria is obliged to pay to the
German Government the sum of 1,000 German Reichs Marks
for the privilege thereof—Austria had been accustomed before
this edict of the German Government to receive into
Austria some one hundred thousand visitors from Germany
annually.</p>

<p>“I further state that the aforesaid barrier placed against
<span class='pageno' title='981' id='Page_981'></span>
Austria was extremely injurious to Austrian agriculture and
industrial interests.” (<span class='it'>2994-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Jodl stated in his diary that in 1938 the aim of German policy
was the elimination of Austria and Czechoslovakia. The will of
resistance in both countries was undermined by pressure on the
government as well as by propaganda and the fifth column. At
the same time German military preparations for attack were
worked out (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>). (“Case Otto” was the code name for the
Austrian campaign, and “Case Green” was the code name for
the battle plans against Czechoslovakia.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jodl also stated in his diary that when Chancellor von Schuschnigg
announced the proposed plebiscite for 13 March 1938, Hitler
was determined to intervene. Goering, General Reichenau, and
Minister Glaise-Horstenau were called before Hitler. “Case
Otto” was to be prepared, and the mobilization of army units and
air forces was ordered on 10 March 1938. The march into Austria
took place on 11 March 1938. (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(12) <span class='it'>Hitler and the Nazi conspirators completed the annexation
of Austria by decree.</span> On 11 March 1938 Hitler issued a directive
regarding “Case Otto” addressed to the German armed
forces, classified Top Secret, in which he stated that, if other
measures proved useless, his intentions were to invade Austria
with armed force. The directive prescribed operational duties
and assigned objectives. It further provided that resistance was
to be broken up ruthlessly with armed force. (<span class='it'>C-102</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later on that same day, at 8:45 p. m., Hitler issued a second
directive, which stated in substance, that the demands of the German
ultimatum to Austria had not been fulfilled, and for that reason
the entry of German armed forces into Austria would commence
at daybreak on 12 March 1938. He directed that all objectives
were to be reached by exerting all forces to the full as
quickly as possible. (<span class='it'>C-182</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 13 March 1938 Germany in violation of Article 80 of the
Treaty of Versailles, formally incorporated Austria into the Reich
by decree and declared it to be a province of the German Reich.
(<span class='it'>2307-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Officials of the Province of Austria were then required by decree
to take an oath of personal obedience to Hitler. Jews were
barred from taking this oath, and thus could not retain offices and
positions previously held. (<span class='it'>2311-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Members of the Austrian Army were required to take an oath
of personal allegiance to Hitler as their Supreme Commander.
(<span class='it'>2936-PS</span>)
<span class='pageno' title='982' id='Page_982'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Compulsory military service was instituted in Austria by law,
which provided the Greater German Reich with additional manpower
for its armed forces. (<span class='it'>1660-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(13) <span class='it'>Seyss-Inquart participated in the execution of the plans
for aggression against Czechoslovakia.</span> In an official report to
Viscount Halifax, Basil Newton, an official of the British Government,
related some of the “gangster methods employed by the
Reich to obtain its ends in Czecho-Slovakia.” The part played by
Seyss-Inquart was described in this report in the following words:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“On M. Sidor’s return to Bratislava, after he had been entrusted
with the Government in place of Mgr. Tiso, Herr
Buerckel, Herr Seyss-Inquart and five German generals came
at about 10 pm on the evening of Saturday, the 11th March,
into a Cabinet meeting in progress at Bratislava, and told
the Slovak Government that they should proclaim the independence
of Slovakia. When M. Sidor showed hesitation,
Herr Buerckel took him on one side and explained that Herr
Hitler had decided to settle the question of Czecho-Slovakia
definitely. Slovakia ought, therefore, to proclaim her independence
because Herr Hitler would otherwise disinterest
himself in her fate. M. Sidor thanked Herr Buerckel for this
information, but said that he must discuss the situation with
the Government at Prague.” (<span class='it'>D-571</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler expressed his intention to crush Czechoslovakia in the
following language:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“ ‘At Munich I did not take Bohemia and Moravia into the
German territorial sphere [“<span class='it'>Lebensraum</span>”]. I left the Czechs
only another five months, but for the Slovaks I have some
sympathy. I approved the Award of Vienna in the conviction
that the Slovaks would separate themselves from the
Czechs and declare their independence, which would be under
German protection. That is why I have refused Hungarian
demands in respect of Slovakia. As the Slovaks appear to
be agreeing with the Czechs it looks as though they have not
respected the spirit of the Vienna Award. This I cannot
tolerate. To-morrow at mid-day I shall begin military action
against the Czechs, which will be carried out by General
Brauchitsch’ (who was present and to whom he
pointed). ‘Germany,’ he said, ‘does not intend to take
Slovakia into her “<span class='it'>Lebensraum</span>,” and that is why you must
either immediately proclaim the independence of Slovakia
or I will disinterest myself in her fate. To make your choice
<span class='pageno' title='983' id='Page_983'></span>
I give you until to-morrow mid-day, when the Czechs will
be crushed by the German steam-roller.’ ” (<span class='it'>D-571</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Ribbentrop and von Neurath also participated in the execution
of the Nazi plot to obliterate Czechoslovakia as a nation. (<span class='it'>D-571</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The use of pressure, fifth columnists, and propaganda to undermine
resistance in Czechoslovakia, and the preparation of military
plans for the attack upon that country were all noted by
Jodl in his diary. (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the annexation of Austria by Germany Seyss-Inquart
was in communication and contact with Konrad Henlein, the
leader of the Sudeten German Nazis in Czechoslovakia. On 29
December 1937 Seyss-Inquart wrote a letter to Henlein in encouraging
terms and extended his warmest sympathy and hope
for the success of the Sudeten Germans (<span class='it'>3523-PS</span>). Henlein
thereafter replied in a letter to Seyss-Inquart dated a few days
after the German annexation of Austria had been accomplished.
In this letter Henlein expressed his pride in the fact that Seyss-Inquart,
born a Sudeten German, had fulfilled the task determined
by the Fuehrer in the most decisive hour of German history.
He also thanked Seyss-Inquart for the effect and influence
the developments in Austria would have in the Sudetenland.

<h3>C. <span class='it'>SEYSS-INQUART PARTICIPATED IN THE POLITICAL PLANNING AND PREPARATION OF THE NAZI CONSPIRATORS FOR WARS OF AGGRESSION AND WARS IN VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL TREATIES, AGREEMENTS, AND ASSURANCES SET FORTH IN COUNTS ONE AND TWO OF THE INDICTMENT.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>The German Reichstag came under the control of the Nazi conspirators
with the advent of Hitler into the German Government
and became a willing tool in the hands of Hitler and the conspirators.
(See Sections 2, 3, and 4 of chapter VII on the acquisition
and consolidation of totalitarian political control, and terrorization
of political opponents.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The members of the Reich Cabinet were the accomplices, aiders
and abettors of Hitler and his closest Nazi lieutenants in the
political planning and preparation for Wars of Aggression and
Wars in Violation of International Treaties, Agreements and
Assurances. (See section 3 of chapter XV on the Reich Cabinet.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seyss-Inquart was a member of the Reichstag and of the Reich
Cabinet before the invasion of Poland, and occupied those positions
until the unconditional surrender of Germany. Thus he is
<span class='pageno' title='984' id='Page_984'></span>
equally responsible for the acts and decisions of the members of
those governmental bodies concerning the political planning and
preparation of the Nazi Conspirators for Wars of Aggression
and Wars in Violation of International Treaties, Agreements and
Assurances set forth in Counts One and Two of the Indictment.

<h3>D. <span class='it'>SEYSS-INQUART AUTHORIZED, DIRECTED, AND PARTICIPATED IN THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT WAR CRIMES AS SET FORTH IN THE INDICTMENT.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Austria.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) <span class='it'>Position and authority of Seyss-Inquart.</span> Seyss-Inquart
was appointed Reich Governor of Austria by Hitler on 15 March
1938, and was put in charge of the Civil Administration. Austria
had then ceased to exist as an independent nation and was a
province of the German Reich. (<span class='it'>2910-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3425-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Goering, as Delegate for the Four-Year Plan, commissioned
Seyss-Inquart, who was then <span class='it'>Reichsstatthalter</span> in Austria, jointly
with the Plenipotentiary of the Reich, to consider and take any
steps necessary for the “Aryanization of business and economic
life, and to execute this process in accordance with our laws”
(Laws of the Reich). (<span class='it'>3460-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seyss-Inquart participated in the drafting of laws for the
sequestration and confiscation of property of the so-called “enemies
of the people and State.” Evidence of this fact is found in
the correspondence between Seyss-Inquart and Dr. Lammers,
Chief of the Reichs Chancellery. On 24 October 1938 Seyss-Inquart
wrote a letter to Dr. Lammers stating in substance that
the law providing for the sequestration and confiscation of the
property of enemies of the State was almost completed and ready
for the signature of the Fuehrer, and expressing hope that the
signature would be obtained soon. Dr. Lammers replied to Seyss-Inquart
that the decree would be issued by the Reichsministerof
the Interior, a copy of which had been submitted to Hitler, who
had expressed no objections. (<span class='it'>3448-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3447-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The power and authority of Seyss-Inquart with respect to the
sequestration and confiscation of the property of “enemies of the
State” stemmed from a decree empowering the <span class='it'>Reichsstatthalter</span>
in Vienna, or the office designated by him, to confiscate property
of persons or societies which had promoted efforts inimical to the
people of the State. This decree also attempted to legalize the
confiscation of property ordered by the Secret State Police prior
to the issuance of the decree. (<span class='it'>3450-PS</span>) This decree appeared
<span class='pageno' title='985' id='Page_985'></span>
to be a secret law, because it was not published. Yet its existence
as law is evidenced by a letter written to the Reichsfuehrer SS
and Chief of the German Police, Himmler, in January 1939, which
shows that the decree was in fact issued on 18 November 1938.
(<span class='it'>3449-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) <span class='it'>Murder and illtreatment of civilians.</span> Seyss-Inquart was
aware that so-called enemies of the State were imprisoned in concentration
camps. His knowledge of this matter is evidenced by
his claim of credit for the transfer of his predecessor—Chancellor
of Austria, von Schuschnigg—from one concentration camp to
another in south Germany which was in the path of the armed
forces of the United States. (<span class='it'>3254-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the most notorious concentration camps was Mauthausen,
located in Austria and in existence while Seyss-Inquart
was the Reich Governor of the Province of Austria. As has
already been shown, this camp became noted as an extermination
center. (<span class='it'>2176-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) <span class='it'>Plunder of public and private property.</span> Even before the
issuance of the above decree for the sequestration and confiscation
of the property of the so-called enemies of the State, Seyss-Inquart
wrote a letter to Hitler indicating that he had come into
possession of from 700 to 900 valuable tapestries. Seyss-Inquart
offered to display the most beautiful pieces so that the Fuehrer
might make a selection. In this same letter Seyss-Inquart expressed
his pride and wonder over the manner in which Hitler had
“solved the Sudeten problem.” (<span class='it'>3391-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>While Seyss-Inquart was Reich Governor of the Province of
Austria a large quantity of valuable property, including works of
art, belonging to the so-called enemies of the State, was seized,
sequestered, and confiscated. A partial list of such property is
found in a memorandum which referred to a report of the Reich
Fuehrer SS and Chief of the German Police submitted with a letter
dated 10 August 1938 and received in Berlin 26 September
1938. This inventory listed a total of 162 cases of confiscation,
of which 113 cases had a value of some 93,366,358.24 marks. It
is significant that the former owners of this property were Jews
and political opponents of the Nazis. (<span class='it'>3446-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Poland.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) <span class='it'>Position and authority.</span> Seyss-Inquart was appointed
Deputy Governor General of the Polish Occupied Territory by
Hitler’s decree of 12 October 1939, which also appointed Hans
Frank Governor General of the Polish Occupied Territory. The
official title of the government of Poland under the Nazi conspirators
<span class='pageno' title='986' id='Page_986'></span>
was the “General Government” (<span class='it'>3147-PS</span>). Prior to his
appointment as Deputy Governor General of the Polish Occupied
Territory from the early part of September 1939 to 12 October
1939, Seyss-Inquart was Chief of the Civil Administration of
South Poland (<span class='it'>2910-PS</span>). Seyss-Inquart as Deputy Governor
General of the Polish Occupied Territory was second only to the
Governor General, Frank. (<span class='it'>2233-CC-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Chief of the Office of the Governor General of the Polish
Occupied Territory and the Higher SS and Police Leaders were
directly subordinate to the Governor General and his representative.
In turn the leaders of the General and Security Police were
subordinated to the Higher SS and Police Leaders. (<span class='it'>3468-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to Hans Frank, Seyss-Inquart organized the General
Government of Poland. When Seyss-Inquart was about to depart
to assume his new duties as Reich Commissar for the Occupied
Netherlands, Frank eulogized Seyss-Inquart as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“In the construction of the General-Government, your name
will forever take a place of honor as originator of this organization

of all SS organizations and the whole police force of the General-Government,

<p class='pindent'>During November 1939 Seyss-Inquart made a tour of inspection
in Poland. While on this tour he gave lectures to the German
officials of the General Government of Poland concerning their
duties and German administrative policy in that country. He
told these officials that the only principal aim of that policy was
to satisfy the interests of the Reich and that they should promote
everything of use to the Reich and hamper all that might damage
the Reich. He instructed the officials that the German Government
must utilize the General Government of Poland for German
economic purposes. (<span class='it'>2278-PS</span>)</p>

to Seyss-Inquart that all criminals found in the penitentiaries
were shot. The executions, however, were conducted in
closed-off wooded areas and not in public. (<span class='it'>2278-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his report concerning his tour of inspection Seyss-Inquart
<span class='pageno' title='987' id='Page_987'></span>
stated that the intellectuals of Poland were to a greater part
locked up. He also passed on the suggestion made by District
Governor Schmidt to use the “moorish” country around Cychov,
Poland, as a reservoir for Jews because this measure might have
a decimating effect upon the Jewish population of Poland.
(<span class='it'>2278-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hans Frank, in his capacity as Governor General of the Polish
Occupied Territory, made an official report to Hitler in which he
stated that, in the course of time, the German rule had led to a
substantial deterioration in the “attitude” of the entire Polish
people due to malnutrition, mass arrests, mass shootings, and
rigorous methods used to obtain forced labor. In this report it
was admitted that before 1939 the food supply of the Polish people
was quite adequate to sustain them. (<span class='it'>437-PS</span>)</p>

tour of inspection Seyss-Inquart ordered the seizure of all
soap stocks, and informed the German officials that the seizure
of soap and tea was to be regarded as most important. In addition
he ordered a marshalling of goods such as oil, salt, manures,
etc., in monopolies such as cooperative societies. He also directed
that the Polish unemployment fund in a considerable amount be
diverted to the repair of damaged buildings. (<span class='it'>2278-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frank in his report to Hitler stated that there had been a confiscation
of a great part of Polish estates, together with encroachments
upon and confiscation of the assets of industries, trades,
professions, and other private property. (<span class='it'>437-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>d</span>) <span class='it'>Conscription of civilian labor.</span> Seyss-Inquart, as Deputy
Governor General of the Polish Occupied Territory, attended
most staff meetings held by Frank, the Governor General. Among
the subjects discussed and decided upon at those meetings was
the conscription and deportation of vast numbers of Polish nationals
to the Reich for forced labor. Some of these deportees
were employed in instruments of war production in violation of
Articles 6, 23h, 46, and 52 of the Hague Regulations 1907, as
well as the Prisoner of War Convention (Geneva 1929). On 11
January 1940 one Frauendorfer reported in the presence of
Seyss-Inquart that daily transports, each carrying 1,000 workers,
were going to the Reich. Thus Seyss-Inquart aided and abetted
in these violations. (<span class='it'>2233-B-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to Frank approximately 160,000 agricultural workers
and 50,000 industrial workers were conscripted and deported
from Poland to the Reich up to and including 21 April 1940. Because
the total quota had been fixed at 500,000 and because there
were not enough “voluntary enlistments”, solution to the problem
<span class='pageno' title='988' id='Page_988'></span>
was sought in the use of coercive measures. Seyss-Inquart
participated actively in the discussions on this matter, and thus
aided materially in the solution of the problem. (<span class='it'>2233-N-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>e</span>) <span class='it'>Germanization of occupied territories.</span> The Nazi government
of the Polish Occupied Territory was determined to make
Poland entirely German. (Evidence of this intention is discussed
in Chapter XIII.) In addition, Frank in his report to Hitler reported
that there had been an expropriation of property and expulsion
of Polish nationals therefrom for German settlements in
Poland. (<span class='it'>437-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>The Netherlands.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) <span class='it'>Position and authority of Seyss-Inquart.</span> Seyss-Inquart
was appointed Reich Commissar for the occupied Netherlands
territories by decree of Hitler dated 18 May 1940. This decree
made Seyss-Inquart “guardian of the interests of the Reich”
and invested him with “supreme civil authority.” Seyss-Inquart
was made responsible only to Hitler, and empowered to promulgate
laws by decree for the occupied Netherlands territories.
(<span class='it'>1376-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2910-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) <span class='it'>Abrogation and modification of Netherlands legislation
not justified by military necessity.</span> In his capacity as Reich Commissar
of the occupied Netherlands territories Seyss-Inquart authorized
and directed the abrogation or modification of Netherlands
legislation not demanded or justified by military exigency.
This action was in violation of Article 43 of the Hague Regulations,
1907.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The acts abolished included Provincial and Municipal Laws.
(<span class='it'>3340-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3342-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ordinary criminal laws not in conflict with the permissible
objectives of the occupying power were abrogated, suspended, or
radically changed. Administrative courts martial were established
by decree of Seyss-Inquart as Reich Commissar which empowered
the Leader of the Superior SS and the Police and Special
Agents appointed by the Reich Commissar to deviate from existing
law. This decree also prescribed harsh penalties for misdemeanors,
extending from 10 years to life imprisonment, and
include the death penalty (i) for participation in “activities
likely to disturb or endanger public order and security” and (ii)
for intentional violation of the orders of the Reich Commissar.
(<span class='it'>2111-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Existing marriage laws were amended by Seyss-Inquart so as
to require approval of the Reich Commissar instead of the consent
of parent or guardian in the case of Dutch girls. The statutory
<span class='pageno' title='989' id='Page_989'></span>
waiting period was also abolished. Thus, intermarriage of
Germans with female persons of Netherlands nationality were
facilitated and promoted. (<span class='it'>3339-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Existing legislation concerning Netherlands nationality was
modified by Seyss-Inquart so as to favor Germany. (<span class='it'>3341-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Additional decrees not justified or demanded by the military
interests of the occupant were issued by Seyss-Inquart as Reich
Commissar. These decrees amended or superseded and distorted
existing laws concerning press, education, social services, corporate
life, trade unionism, medical care, art, science, and divers
phases of the political, social, economic, and industrial life of
the Netherlands. Some of these enactments, including the discriminatory
decrees against the Jews, are considered in greater
detail hereafter. (<span class='it'>1726-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>c</span>) <span class='it'>Germanization of Netherlands Territory.</span> Seyss-Inquart
in his capacity as Reich Commissar for the occupied Dutch Territory,
took affirmative steps to assimilate the territory under his
jurisdiction politically, culturally, socially, and economically into
the German Reich. This action violated Articles 43, 46, 55, and 56
of the Hague Regulations, 1907, the laws and customs of war, the
general principles of criminal law, the internal penal laws of
the countries in which such crimes were committed, and Article
6 (b) of the Charter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The more offensive crimes in the above category, such as
economic exploitation and enforced conscription are considered in
detail elsewhere in this section. Other “Germanization” measures,
such as the decrees promoting marriage between German
males and female Netherlanders, and altering citizenship laws in
favor of Germany, have been previously adverted to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he assumed office on 29 May 1940, Seyss-Inquart said in
a speech at The Hague:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“We neither will oppress this land and its people imperialistically
nor will we impose on them our political convictions.
We will bring this about in no other way—only through our
deportment and our example.” (<span class='it'>3430-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>bona fides</span> of the above statement is belied by a public
statement made by Seyss-Inquart two years later. In a speech
at Hengelo on 19 May 1943 he revealed his true purpose:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Several times it has been held against me that I have let
national socialism come to the fore in all phases in public
life. As far as I am concerned that is no reproach, it is a
historical mission, which I have to fulfill here.” (<span class='it'>3430-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Full disclosure of Seyss-Inquart’s intentions and actions with
respect to nazification and exploitation of Holland was made in
<span class='pageno' title='990' id='Page_990'></span>
a Top Secret report prepared by him and sent to Berlin covering
the situation in the Netherlands during the period 29 May to 19
July 1940. This report was forwarded by Lammers of the Reich
Chancellery to Rosenberg. Seyss-Inquart prefaces the report by
describing his mission as not merely the guarding of Reich interests
and maintaining order, but also the building of close economic
ties between the Netherlands and the Reich. The report
catalogues in considerable detail the measures initiated by Seyss-Inquart,
discusses the building up of the NSDAP in the Netherlands,
and adverts to the proposed creation of Nazi para-military
and corresponding organizations. It also mentions the efforts
made to bring about an assimilation of interests between Holland
and Germany in the fields of economics and agriculture, culture,
art, and science. The report points out that the allocation of
supplies made, and financial and currency arrangements prescribed,
were favorable to the Reich; that such transactions were
signed by Dutch officials so that the “appearance of being voluntary”
was preserved. (<span class='it'>997-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>d</span>) <span class='it'>Spoliation of property.</span> In his capacity as Reich Commissar
for the Occupied Netherlands territory Seyss-Inquart authorized,
directed, and participated in the exploitation of the
material resources of the Occupied Netherlands territory for
purposes unrelated to the needs of the Army of Occupation.
These acts were all in violation of Article 6 (b) of the Charter
and Articles 43, 46-49, 52 of the Hague Regulations, 1907.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These crimes, for which Seyss-Inquart is responsible not only
by virtue of his position as the dominant civil representative of
the Reich Government in the Occupied Netherlands territory but
also because of his direct participation in the initiation and execution
of such criminal policies, took the following form:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Control and exploitation of the Netherlands economy in the interest
of the German total war effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Levy of excessive occupation charges on the Netherlands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Exaction of large sums of money and gold as “external occupation
costs,” or “contributions to the war against Bolshevism.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Requisitioning of gold and foreign exchange of Dutch nationals
for purposes unrelated to the needs of the occupation army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Use of German reichsmarks as currency in the Netherlands for
purposes unrelated to the needs of the occupation army, with
compulsory free exchange of such Reichsmarks for gulden by the
Netherlands Bank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(Evidence of the foregoing methods of exploitation of the occupied
Netherlands and correlative enrichment of the Reich is discussed
in Chapter XIII.)
<span class='pageno' title='991' id='Page_991'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi conspirators were measurably aided in executing the
foregoing policies in Holland by the cooperation of a local Nazi,
Rost van Tonnigen, who was appointed President of the Netherlands
Bank and Treasurer in the Netherlands Ministry of Finance
by Seyss-Inquart in the spring of 1941. The cooperative spirit
with which van Tonnigen discharged his responsibilities in these
posts was disclosed in the following excerpt from a report of the
German Commissar of the Netherlands Bank:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The new President of the Netherlands Bank, Mr. Rost van
Tonnigen, is, in contrast to a large part of the leadership,
penetrated in his movements and his official acts by the
greater German thought, and convinced of the necessity of
the creation of a greater European economic space. This
ideological attitude in itself gives him the correct position on
financial and monetary policy questions for his country in
relation to the greater German economic space. Furthermore
it makes easier cooperation with my office, a fact which
deserves special mention in consideration of the frequently
observed impossible conduct of the Netherlands agencies before
the entrance into office of the new President. I consider
as a fortunate solution the fact that the Reichskommissar
for the Occupied Dutch Areas has also entrusted Mr. Rost
van Tonnigen with the Treasury of the Ministry of Finance
[<span class='it'>Schatzamt des Finanzministeriums</span>]. Mr. Rost van Tonnigen
took over this office at the end of the month of April.
Thus there is a guarantee that the financial and monetary
policy of the country will be conducted according to unified
points of view.” (<span class='it'>ECR-174</span>; see also <span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt</span>, No.
22, 24 August 1940 (Fourth Order of the Reich Commissar
for the Occupied Netherlands concerning certain Administrative
Measures); <span class='it'>Lemkin</span>, “Axis Rule in Occupied Europe,”
pp. 455-456.)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to the responsibility which attaches to Seyss-Inquart
as a result of his dominant position in the Netherlands, his
appointment of Nazi-minded individuals to key positions, and his
complete knowledge of and acquiescence in illegal Nazi policies,
there is conclusive evidence of his initiation of such policies. In
April 1942 “at the instigation of the Reich Commissar Seyss-Inquart”
the Netherlands began to pay a “voluntary contribution
to the war against Bolshevism” of 50,000,000 gulders per month,
retroactive to 1 July 1941, of which ten million per month was
paid in gold. (<span class='it'>ECR-195</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>By 31 March 1944, this contribution amounted to 2,150,000,000
RM. (<span class='it'>EC-86</span>)
<span class='pageno' title='992' id='Page_992'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The alleged “voluntary” character of the contribution is to be
taken with considerable reserve in view of the admission contained
in Seyss-Inquart’s Top Secret report of 29 May to 19 July
1940, that the voluntary nature of previous financial and economic
measures was in reality fictional. (<span class='it'>997-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, the question whether or not the contribution is to
be deemed at the direction of Seyss-Inquart or was in fact “voluntary”
is immaterial. It is manifest that the then President of
the Netherlands Bank and Treasurer in the Ministry of Finance,
van Tonnigen, acted in the German interest and to the detriment
of the Netherlands. His acts are attributable to the responsible
head of the German Civil Administration in the Netherlands and
the individual to whom he owed his appointment, Seyss-Inquart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>e</span>) <span class='it'>Participation in activities of Einsatzstab Rosenberg.</span>
Seyss-Inquart, in his capacity as Reich Commissar for the Occupied
Netherlands territory, also cooperated with and acquiesced
in the activities of the <span class='it'>Einsatzstab Rosenberg</span> in the territory under
his jurisdiction. He is therefore responsible for his actions
in this regard, which constituted crimes under Article 6 (b) of
the Charter and violations of Articles 46, 47, and 56 of the Hague
Regulations, 1907.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(The <span class='it'>Einsatzstab Rosenberg</span>, which commenced as a research
library project, developed into a systematic program for the
wholesale looting of art treasures and cultural objects in the conquered
territories. Its activities are discussed in Chapter XIV.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Implication of Seyss-Inquart in the criminal activities of the
<span class='it'>Einsatzstab Rosenberg</span> is revealed in a detailed progress report
of its chief Netherlands representative, Schimmer. The first
paragraph of this report states as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Working Group Netherland of the <span class='it'>Einsatzstab Reichsleiter
Rosenberg</span> began its work in agreement with the competent
representative of the Reichkommissar during the first
days of September 1940. The execution of the post, conforming
with the Fuehrer’s orders, coordinated itself with
the liquidation, that is confiscation, according to civil law, of
the various subversive institutions—as set forth in the circulars
of the OKW, dated 5 July 1940, and of the Chief of
the OKW to the Commander in Chief of the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> in
France, dated 17 September 1940, as well as to the Commander
in Chief of the OKW in the Netherlands, dated 30
October 1940. The screening of the material of the various
Masonic lodges was taken care of primarily, and the library
and the archives of the following lodges were sifted and all
useful material was packed.” (<span class='it'>176-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='993' id='Page_993'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>There follows the specification of some 92 Masonic IOOF
Lodges and Rotary Clubs which were screened and yielded 470
cases of valuable objects. Also, a large number of libraries and
scientific and cultural institutions were listed with the statement
that all books and archives contained therein were being catalogued
preparatory to shipment to Germany. (<span class='it'>176-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The report concludes with the following statement indicating
close integration in the Netherlands between Rosenberg’s program
of grand larceny and Seyss-Inquart’s anti-Jewish program, viz:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Working Group, in executing the afore-mentioned
tasks, is bound strictly to the pace set by the Reichskommissar
for the handling of the Jewish questions and that of
the international organizations. This pace again is determined
by the political evolution which is taking shape according
to decisions made on a higher level, and which must
not be hampered by individual acts.” (<span class='it'>176-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Other documents captured from Rosenberg’s files remove any
doubt whatever as to Seyss-Inquart’s full knowledge of the criminal
activities of the <span class='it'>Einsatzstab Rosenberg</span> in Holland and his
participation therein. On 11 September 1944 Rosenberg informed
Seyss-Inquart by letter that orders had been issued for the seizure
and transportation to Germany of the library of the Social Institute
in Amsterdam. (<span class='it'>091-PS</span>; see also <span class='it'>1621-PS</span>, a secret letter
from Reichsfuehrer SS (Himmler) ordering SS Gen. Rauter in
the Hague to seize medical apparatus at the Universities of Leyden
and Utrecht with the aid of Seyss-Inquart.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>f</span>) <span class='it'>Conscription of civilian labor.</span> In his capacity as Reich
Commissar for the occupied Netherlands territories Seyss-Inquart
authorized and directed the deportation of vast numbers of
Netherlands nationals to the Reich for forced labor in the instruments
of German war production. These acts were all in
violation of Articles 6 (b) and (c) of the Charter; Articles 6, 23h,
46, and 52 of the Hague Regulations, 1907 (<span class='it'>3737-PS</span>); and the
Prisoner of War Convention, Geneva, 1929. (<span class='it'>3738-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The deportation program in the Netherlands was initiated on
20 June 1940, five weeks after the occupation of that country.
The Germans at first deported only the unemployed, threatening
them with curtailment of their dole for refusal. Thereafter in
1942 measures were taken to draft employed workmen. Dutch
business concerns were combed in “Sauckel-actions” for available
workers, who were forced to register at the labor offices.
Workmen who refused were prosecuted by the SD, committed to
one of the prisoners’ camps in the Netherlands, and eventually
put to work in Germany. By the end of April 1942 the program
<span class='pageno' title='994' id='Page_994'></span>
was in full operation, and not less than 22,000 workers were
deported that month. Many Belgian concerns not considered essential
were closed down to release manpower for deportation
to Germany or for work in Dutch industries deemed essential to
the German war effort. New measures of a drastic nature were
inaugurated in the spring of 1943. All males between 18 and
35 were forced to register for “<span class='it'>arbeitseinsatz</span>” (war effort),
which was synonymous with deportation. As time elapsed and
the German military situation deteriorated, the measures taken
became increasingly more ruthless. Whole sections of a town
were lined off and people were seized in the streets or in their
homes and transported to Germany. A total of approximately
431,500 Netherlands workers were deported to Germany and
other foreign countries. (<span class='it'>1726-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Illustrative of the participation of Seyss-Inquart in the slave
labor program are four proclamations which he caused to be
issued, calling up Dutch civilians between certain ages for forced
labor and threatening them with shooting in the case of noncompliance.
(<span class='it'>1162-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sauckel, General Plenipotentiary for the Employment of Labor,
on 5 October 1945 disclosed, under oath, the part played by Seyss-Inquart
in the forced recruitment of Dutch workers for German
war production. The following is an excerpt from an interrogation
of Sauckel:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Q. For a moment I want to turn our attention to Holland.
It is my understanding that the quotas for the workers for
Holland were agreed upon, and then the numbers given to
the Reichskommissar Seyss-Inquart to fulfill. Isn’t that
correct?</p>

<p>“A. Yes, that is correct.</p>

<p>“Q. After the quota was given to Seyss-Inquart, it was his
mission to fulfill it with the aid of your representatives, was
it not?</p>

<p>“A. Yes. This was the only possible thing for me to do and
the same applied to the other countries.” (<span class='it'>3722-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Seyss-Inquart has himself acknowledged under oath his active
participation in deporting 250,000 Netherlands workmen between
the ages of 17 and 42 toward the end of 1944, although he attempted
to shift responsibility by stating that the order was
issued by the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> and that “I can’t intervene against the
<span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span>.” However, he admitted:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I didn’t oppose it. I helped to carry it out in my province.”
(<span class='it'>Transcript of Interrogation of Seyss-Inquart</span>, afternoon

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='995' id='Page_995'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>g</span>) <span class='it'>Murder and ill-treatment of civilian population, including
killing of hostages.</span> Seyss-Inquart, in his capacity as Reich Commissar
for the Occupied Netherlands Territory, authorized and
directed the exaction of collective penalties, murder, and ill-treatment
of the civilian population of the Netherlands, and the
killing of hostages. All these actions constituted war crimes and
crimes against humanity within the meaning of Article 6 (b) and
(c) of the Charter, and violated (i) the Hague Regulations, 1907,
Articles 46 and 50, (ii) the laws and customs of war, (iii) the
general principles of criminal law as derived from the criminal
laws of all civilized nations and (iv) the internal penal laws of
Netherlands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Public utterances of Seyss-Inquart reveal his determination to
resort to ruthless measures for the purpose of intimidating and
repressing the civilian population. In a speech commemorating
the 10th Anniversary of Germany’s coming into power, at Weert
on 29 January 1943, before workers and trades of the NSDAP,
he spoke in part as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I will give my instructions. They must be executed by all.
In the present situation a refusal to execute such instructions
could be regarded only as sabotage. It is also clear, now
more than ever, that every resistance which is directed
against this fight for existence must be suppressed. Some
time ago the representatives of the churches had written to
the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> commander and to me, and they presented
their conception against the execution of death sentences
which the Wehrmacht commanders announced in the meantime.
To this I can only say the following: The moment in
which our men, fathers and sons with iron determination
look towards their fate in the east and unflinchingly and
steadfastly perform their highest pledge, it is unbearable to
tolerate conspiracies whose goal is to weaken the rear of this
eastern front. Whoever dares this must be annihilated. We
must be severe and become even more severe against our
opponents, this is the command of a relentless sequence of
events, and for us perhaps humanly hard, but our holy duty.
We remain human because we do not torture our opponents,
we must remain firm by annihilating them.” (<span class='it'>3430-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Endorsement of the policy of holding innocent persons responsible
for the misconduct of others beyond their control is implicit
in the following public statement of Seyss-Inquart made at Weert
on 8 January 1945:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I have given orders to suppress all appearances with a severeness
<span class='pageno' title='996' id='Page_996'></span>
corresponding to the brutality of the crime. If in
connection with these measures Dutch citizens are affected
and have to undergo difficulties and limitations of special nature,
then they have to seek the cause therefor solely in these
eruptions of the anarchistic mental attitude of a few culprits
and the just-as-criminal-tolerance or apathy within their
own circles.” (<span class='it'>3430-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Evidence of Seyss-Inquart’s application of this doctrine of vicarious
responsibility is contained in a poster signed by him and
warning the Dutch population to expect reprisals in the event of
sabotage. The poster reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>“NOTICE</p>

<p>“I consider all inhabitants responsible for the destruction or
damage to railroad installations, waterways with their installations,
telephone cables and Post Offices occurring within
the boundaries of their locality.</p>

<p>“The population of such localities may therefore expect reprisals
in the form of seizure of property and destruction of
houses or groups of houses.</p>

<p>“I therefore advise the population to protect the means of
transportation and communications by means of patrols or
other appropriate measures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another poster issued by the Superior SS and Police Chief publicized

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In an interrogation under oath Seyss-Inquart has acknowledged
that Netherlanders were shot as hostages without trial. While he
sought to shift responsibility to the SS he admitted that upon one
<span class='pageno' title='997' id='Page_997'></span>
occasion the SS called on him to furnish 50 hostages and that he
gave five instead, all of whom were shot. (<span class='it'>Transcript of Interrogation
of Seyss-Inquart</span>, 18 September 1945, p. 20)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other crimes against humanity are documented in the statement
of the Dutch Government. The vastness of the scale of the
commission of such crimes and the necessary notoriety thereof
clearly implicate Seyss-Inquart as the responsible civil head of
the German Government in the Netherlands territory. (<span class='it'>1726-PS</span>)</p>

<h3>E. <span class='it'>SEYSS-INQUART PARTICIPATED IN THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY AS SET FORTH IN THE INDICTMENT.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Austria.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>a</span>) <span class='it'>Persecution of the Jews.</span> While Seyss-Inquart was the
Reich Governor of the Province of Austria, laws were issued
against Jews and against those who opposed the Nazi Regime
politically. As has been shown, this usually took the form of
decrees providing for the sequestration and confiscation of the
property of these so-called “enemies of the State.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the early days of November 1938, pogroms against the Jews
took place all over the German Reich, including Austria. These
pogroms resulted from the killing of von Rath, a diplomatic official
at the German Embassy in Paris, by a young Jew named
Grynszpan. Jewish synagogues, homes and shops were smashed
and destroyed by fire. Large numbers of Jews were arrested,
jailed, or placed in concentration camps. A partial report as to
what occurred during the 9th and 10th of November 1938 is found
in a letter written by the Reich Commissar for the Reunion of
Austria with the German Reich, Josef Buerckel, to Goering, dated
18 November 1938. This report reveals that the fire department
was not utilized to control the flames consuming Jewish homes,
stores, shops, and synagogues. The school children in Vienna
were given an opportunity to participate in the demonstration
“according to the order.” Buerckel’s report also discloses that
enormous quantities of valuables, jewelry, and merchandise were
stolen from the Jews during these pogroms. (<span class='it'>2237-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>A more detailed description of what happened in Vienna during
the 9th and 10th of November 1938 is found in the stenographic
report of a meeting on “The Jewish Question” under the Chairmanship
of Goering (<span class='it'>1816-PS</span>). This meeting was held on 12
November 1938. It appears from this report that altogether 101
synagogues were destroyed by fire, 76 synagogues demolished, and
7,500 stores ruined in the Reich, including Austria. In this same
<span class='pageno' title='998' id='Page_998'></span>
meeting, a member of the official family of Seyss-Inquart (Reich
Governor of the Province of Austria) related the efficiency with
which the Civil Administration in Austria dealt with the so-called
“Jewish Question.” This official was Fischboeck, and in his
verbal report to Goering he said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“Your Excellency,</p>

<p>“In this matter we have already a very complete plan for
Austria. There are 12,000 Jewish artisans and 5,000 Jewish
retail shops in Vienna. Before the National Revolution, we
had already a definite plan for tradesmen, regarding this
total of 17,000 stores. Of the shops of the 12,000 artisans
about 10,000 were to be closed indefinitely and 2,000 were to
be kept open. 4,000 of the 5,000 retail stores should be closed
and 1,000 should be kept open, that is, were to be Aryanized.
According to this plan, between 3,000 and 3,500 of the total
of 17,000 stores would be kept open, all others closed. This
was decided following investigations in every single branch
and according to local needs, in agreement with all competent
authorities, and is ready for publication as soon as we receive
the law which we requested in September; this law shall empower
us to withdraw licenses from artisans quite independently
from the Jewish Question.” (<span class='it'>1816-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>To this Goering replied:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I shall have this decree issued today.” (<span class='it'>1816-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The stenographic report of this meeting further reveals that the
solution of the so-called “Jewish Problem” adopted in Austria by
Seyss-Inquart and his official family was most efficient from the
viewpoint of Nazi objectives. The plan adopted in Austria became
a model for the entire Reich. (<span class='it'>1816-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>A report of the Bureau of Statistics for the Provinces of Austria
on the Jewish population in Vienna and in Austria, dated 15
December 1939, shows that after the Nazi conspirators assumed
power in Austria, the Jewish population in that country decreased
approximately 100,000. (<span class='it'>1949-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the reasons for the decreases in the Jewish population of
Austria would seem to be obvious, yet tangible evidence of at least
one reason is provided by Seyss-Inquart himself in a letter written
by him to Himmler, dated 4 November 1939. In substance
Seyss-Inquart, while Deputy Governor General of the Polish Occupied
Territory, stated that an official in Cracow had informed
him that there was a plan to send Jews from Vienna to Poland,
whereupon he gave instructions that such action should be carried
<span class='pageno' title='999' id='Page_999'></span>
out only in cooperation with the SD and by the SD, since he would
not permit wild-cat actions. (<span class='it'>3398-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(<span class='it'>b</span>) <span class='it'>Persecution on political grounds.</span> Seyss-Inquart has supplied
evidence that the SS in Austria was responsible for the murder
of Chancellor Dolfuss on 25 July 1934. (<span class='it'>3425-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seyss-Inquart has also supplied evidence that his predecessor as
Chancellor of Austria, von Schuschnigg, had been confined in a
concentration camp after his forced resignation from office.
(<span class='it'>3254-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Poland.</span> The manner is which Polish Jews were treated
and given “special handling” by the Nazi conspirators, although
a matter of common knowledge, was described in detail in the
“Black Book of Poland.” This document tells of the establishment
of special reservations for the Jews as well as ghettos in
various parts of Poland. The report also relates how the Jews
were starved and exterminated in large numbers. A great portion
of these crimes were committed in Poland by the Nazis while
Seyss-Inquart occupied the position of Deputy Governor General
of the Polish Occupied Territory. (<span class='it'>2613-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the time that Seyss-Inquart held this high office in the
Nazi government of Poland, a special decree was issued by Frank,
dated 26 October 1939, which required compulsory labor for Jews
domiciled in the General Government of Poland. The decree was
to take effect immediately and the Jews were to be formed in
forced labor groups. The execution of the decree was placed in
the hands of the Higher SS and Police Leaders. (<span class='it'>2613-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>The Netherlands.</span> Seyss-Inquart, in his capacity as Reich
Commissar of the occupied Dutch territory, bears full individual
responsibility for the execution in the Netherlands of the Nazi
program of persecution of Jews. Acts against the Jews authorized,
directed, or condoned by Seyss-Inquart, which constitute
war crimes and crimes against humanity as defined in Article 6
(b) and (c) of the Charter, included: stigmatization; disfranchisement;
denial of civil rights, personal liberty, and economic
freedom; religious and cultural persecution; use of organized
“spontaneous violence” against persons and property of Jews;
ghettoization; starvation; enforced labor; enslavement; mass deportation,
and annihilation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The intentions of Seyss-Inquart with respect to treatment of
the Jews is a matter of record. In a speech before a gathering of
all workers and trades of the NSDAP at Amsterdam on 13 March
1941 he left no doubt as to where he stood on the Jewish question.
<span class='pageno' title='1000' id='Page_1000'></span>
He said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Jews are the enemy of national socialism and the national
socialistic Reich. From the moment of their emancipation,
their methods were directed to the annihilation of the
common and moral worth of the German people and to replace
national and responsible ideology with international
nihilism. The fatal meaning of Judaism became completely
clear to the German people during the years of the world
war. It was really they, who stuck the knife in the back of
the German army which broke the resistance of the Germans,
and in the year 1918, it was they who wanted to dissolve and
decompose all national tradition and also moral and religious
beliefs of the German people. The Jews for us are not Dutchmen.
They are those enemies with whom we can neither
come to an armistice nor to peace. This applies here, if you
wish, for the duration of the occupation. Do not expect an
order from me which stipulates this, except regulations concerning
police matters. We will beat the Jews wherever we
meet them, and those who join them must bear the consequences.
The Fuehrer declared that the Jews have played
their final act in Europe, and therefore they played their final
act.” (<span class='it'>3430-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Following his assumption of office in the Netherlands on 29
May 1940, Seyss-Inquart, pursuant to the authority vested in him
as Reich Commissar Of the Netherlands by the Fuehrer decree of
18 May 1940, systematically promulgated decrees designed to implement
the Nazi program of persecution and elimination of Jews.
He promulgated a law which prohibited the Jewish ritual
slaughter of animals in the Netherlands Occupied Territories,
thus making it impossible for devout orthodox Jews to live in
accordance with their religious dietary laws. (<span class='it'>2705-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other anti-Semitic decrees of a like nature, all of which were
signed by Seyss-Inquart and published in the <span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt
fuer die besetzen niederlandischen Gebiete</span> (VOBL), may be summarized

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg1014a'>20. CONSTANTIN VON NEURATH</h2>

<h3>A. <span class='it'>POSITIONS AND HONORS HELD BY VON NEURATH.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>He was a member of the Nazi Party from 30 January 1937 until
1945, and was awarded the Golden Party Badge on 30 January
1937.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was General in the SS. He was personally appointed <span class='it'>Gruppenfuehrer</span>
by Hitler in September 1937, and was promoted to
<span class='it'>Obergruppenfuehrer</span> on 21 June 1943.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was Reich Minister of Foreign Affairs under the Chancellorship
of von Papen from 2 June 1932, and under the Chancellorship
of Hitler from 30 January 1933 until he was replaced by
von Ribbentrop on 4 February 1938.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was Reich Minister from 4 February 1938 until May 1945.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was President of the Secret Cabinet Council, to which he
was appointed on 4 February 1938.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a member of the Reich Defense Council.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was Reichs Protector for Bohemia and Moravia from 18
March 1939 until he was replaced by Frick on 25 August 1943.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was awarded the <span class='it'>Adlerorden</span> by Hitler at the time of his
appointment as Reich Protector. Ribbentrop was the only other
German to receive this decoration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These facts are collected in a document signed by von Neurath
and his counsel (<span class='it'>2972-PS</span>). Von Neurath comments on certain
of these matters. He says that the award of the Golden Party
Badge was made on 30 January 1937 against his will and without
his being asked. Yet he not only refrained from repudiating
<span class='pageno' title='1015' id='Page_1015'></span>
the allegedly unwanted honor, but after receiving it attended
meetings at which wars of aggression were planned, actively participated
in the forcible annexation of Austria, and tyrannized
over Bohemia and Moravia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He also contends that his appointment as SS <span class='it'>Gruppenfuehrer</span>
was also against his will and without his being asked. But in this
connection, his wearing of the SS uniform, his receipt of the further
promotion to <span class='it'>Obergruppenfuehrer</span>, and the actions against
Bohemia and Moravia must be considered. In addition, von Neurath
says that his appointment as Foreign Minister was by Reichspresident
von Hindenburg. Yet President von Hindenburg died
in 1934, and von Neurath continued as Foreign Minister until
1938, under the chancellorship first of von Papen and then of
Hitler. He further claims that he was an inactive Minister from
4 February 1938 until May 1945. His activities in this connection
will be mentioned below, particularly with regard to Bohemia
and Moravia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Von Neurath next alleges that the Secret Cabinet Council never
sat or conferred. This Council, of which von Neurath was president,
has been authoritatively described as a select committee of
the Cabinet for the deliberation of foreign affairs, directly subordinated
to the Fuehrer for counsel and assistance (<span class='it'>1774-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“A Privy Cabinet Council, to advise the Fuehrer in the basic
problems of foreign policy, has been created by the decree of
4 February 1938 * * * This Privy Cabinet Council is
under the direction of Reich-Minister v. Neurath, and includes
the Foreign Minister, the Air Minister, the Deputy
Commander for the Fuehrer, the Propaganda Minister, the
Chief of the Reich-Chancellery, the Commanders-in-Chief of
the Army and Navy and the Chief of the Supreme Command
of the Armed Forces. The Privy Cabinet Council constitutes
a select staff of collaborators of the Fuehrer which consists
exclusively of members of the Government of the Reich; thus,
it represents a select committee of the Reich Government for
the deliberation on foreign affairs.” (<span class='it'>1774-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The formal composition of this body is shown in 2031-PS. Von
Neurath held himself out as a member of this body by communicating
with the British Ambassador on Secret Cabinet Council
stationery. (<span class='it'>3287-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Von Neurath, finally, objects that he was not a member of the
Reich Defense Council. This Council was set up soon after Hitler’s
accession to power, on 4 April 1933 (<span class='it'>2261-PS</span>). In an affidavit
by Frick (<span class='it'>2986-PS</span>), this Council is described as follows:
<span class='pageno' title='1016' id='Page_1016'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * We were also members of the Reich Defense Council,
which was supposed to plan preparations in case of war
which later on were published by the Ministerial Council for
the Defense of the Reich.” (<span class='it'>2986-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The membership of this Council included the Minister for Foreign
Affairs, who was then von Neurath. This is shown by a
document giving the composition of the Reich Defense Council,
and including among permanent members the Minister for Foreign
Affairs (<span class='it'>EC-177</span>). That document is dated “Berlin, 22 May
1933,” which was during von Neurath’s tenure of that office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The functioning of the Reich Defense Council, with a representative
of von Neurath’s ministry, von Buelow, present, is
shown by the minutes of the 12th meeting on 14 May 1936 (<span class='it'>EC-407</span>).
Under the secret law of 4 September 1938 von Neurath
was a member of the Reich Defense Council by virtue of his presidency
of the Secret Cabinet Council. This fact is shown by the
enclosure of a copy of that law in a letter addressed to von Neurath
as Reich Protector for Bohemia and Moravia on 6 September
1939 (<span class='it'>2194-PS</span>). It is curious that the Reich Protector for
Bohemia and Moravia denies his membership in the Council when
the letter enclosing the law is one addressed to him. This law
describes the tasks of the Council as follows:</p>

<p class='noindent'>“The task of the Reich Defense Council consists, in peace-time,
of the decision on all measures for the preparation of
Reich defense, and the gathering together of all forces and
means of the nation according to the directions of the Leaders
and Reich Chancellor. The tasks of the Council in wartime
will be especially determined by the Leader and Reich
Chancellor.” (<span class='it'>2194-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The law also lists the permanent members of the Council, and the
seventh one is the President of the Secret Cabinet Council, who
was von Neurath.</p>

<h3>B. <span class='it'>VON NEURATH’S PART, AS FOREIGN MINISTER, IN THE CONSPIRACY FOR THE BREACH OF TREATY OBLIGATIONS.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>In assuming the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs in Hitler’s
Cabinet, von Neurath assumed charge of a foreign policy
committed to breach of treaties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nazi Party had repeatedly and for many years made known
its intention to overthrow Germany’s international commitments,
even at the risk of war. Sections 1 and 2 of the Party Program
(<span class='it'>1708-PS</span>), which was published year after year, declared:
<span class='pageno' title='1017' id='Page_1017'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“1. We demand the unification of all Germans in the Greater
Germany on the basis of the right of self-determination of
peoples.</p>

<p>“2. We demand equality of rights for the German people in
respect to the other nations; abrogation of the peace treaties
of Versailles and St. Germain.” (<span class='it'>1708-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>An even clearer statement of these goals is contained in Hitler’s
speech at Munich on 15 March 1939, in which he said:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“My foreign policy had identical aims. My program was to
abolish the Treaty of Versailles. It is futile nonsense for the
rest of the world to pretend today that I did not reveal this
program until 1933 or 1935 or 1937. Instead of listening to
this foolish chatter of emigres, these gentlemen would have
been wiser to read what I have written thousands of times.”
(<span class='it'>2771-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>If it is “futile nonsense” for foreigners to raise that point, it
would be still more futile for Hitler’s Foreign Minister to suggest
that he was ignorant of the aggressive designs of Nazi policy.
The acceptance of force as a means of solving international problems
and achieving the objectives of Hitler’s foreign policy must
have been known to anyone as closely in touch with Hitler as was
von Neurath. This doctrine, for example, is constantly reiterated
in <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> (<span class='it'>D-660</span>). (See Section 6 of Chapter IX on Aggression
as a Basic Nazi Idea.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hence, by the acceptance and implementation of this foreign
policy, von Neurath assisted and promoted the realization of the
illegal aims of the Nazi Party.</p>

<h3>C. <span class='it'>VON NEURATH’S PART, AS FOREIGN MINISTER, IN THE CONSPIRACY TO CONSOLIDATE NAZI CONTROL OVER GERMANY IN PREPARATION FOR AGGRESSIVE WAR.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>In his capacity as Minister of Foreign Affairs von Neurath
directed the international aspects of the first phase of the Nazi
conspiracy, the consolidation of control in preparation for war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From his close connection with Hitler von Neurath must have
known the cardinal points of Hitler’s policy leading up to the outbreak
of World War II, as outlined in retrospect by Hitler in his
speech to his military leaders on 23 November 1939 (<span class='it'>789-PS</span>).
This policy had two facets: internally, the establishment of rigid
control; externally, the program to release Germany from its international
commitments. The external program had four points:</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='1018' id='Page_1018'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>1.</span><p class='listPara'>Secession from the disarmament conference;</p>
</div>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>2.</span><p class='listPara'>The order to re-arm Germany;</p>
</div>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>3.</span><p class='listPara'>The introduction of compulsory military service; and</p>
</div>

<div class='listEntry'>
<span class='listTag'>4.</span><p class='listPara'>The remilitarization of the Rhineland.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>These points were set out in Hitler’s address of 23 November
1939, after the invasion of Poland:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * I had to reorganize everything beginning with
the mass of the people and extending it to the armed forces.
First, reorganization of the interior, abolishment of appearance
of decay and defeatist ideas, education to heroism.
While reorganizing the interior, I undertook the second task,
to release Germany from its international ties. Two particular
characteristics are to be pointed out: secession from
the League of Nations and denunciation of the disarmament
conference. It was a hard decision. The number of prophets
who predicted that it would lead to the occupation of the
Rhineland was large, the number of believers was very
small. I was supported by the nation, which stood firmly
behind me, when I carried out my intentions. After that,
the order for rearmament. Here again there were numerous
prophets who predicted misfortunes, and only a few believers.
In 1935 the introduction of compulsory armed service.
After that, militarization of the Rhineland, again a
process believed to be impossible at that time. The number
of people who would trust in me were very small. Then the
beginning of the fortification of the whole country, especially
in the West.” (<span class='it'>789-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler thus summarized his pre-war foreign policy in four
points. Von Neurath participated directly and personally in accomplishing
each of these four points, at the same time officially
proclaiming that these measures did not constitute steps toward
aggression. The first is a matter of history. When Germany left
the disarmament conference von Neurath sent telegrams, dated
14th October 1933, to the President of the Conference announcing
Germany’s withdrawal (Documents of German Politics, 1933,
vol. I, p. 94). Similarly, von Neurath made the announcement of
Germany’s withdrawal from the League of Nations on 21 October
1933. (Documents of German Politics, 1933, vol. I). At
the same time, the German government was undertaking far-reaching
military preparation (<span class='it'>C-140</span>; <span class='it'>C-153</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second point regarding German rearmament: When von
Neurath was Foreign Minister, on 10 March 1935, the German
Government officially announced the establishment of the German
air force (<span class='it'>TC-44</span>). On 21 May 1935, Hitler announced a
purported unilateral repudiation of the Naval, Military, and Air
<span class='pageno' title='1019' id='Page_1019'></span>
clauses of the Treaty of Versailles and the Treaty for the Restoration
of Friendly Relations with the United States (<span class='it'>2288-PS</span>). On
the same day the Reich Cabinet, of which von Neurath was a
member, enacted the secret Reich Defense Law creating the office
of Plenipotentiary General for War Economy (<span class='it'>2261-PS</span>), afterwards
described by the <span class='it'>Wehrmacht</span> armament expert as “the cornerstone
of German rearmament” (<span class='it'>2353-PS</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The latter orders were decreed in the Reich defense law
of 21 May 1935, which was supposed to be published only in
case of war, and was already declared valid for carrying out
war preparations. As this law fixed the duties of the armed
forces and the other Reich authorities in case of war, it was
also the fundamental ruling for the development and activity
of the war economy organization.” (<span class='it'>2353-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The third point is the introduction of compulsory military
service. On 16 March 1935 von Neurath signed the law for the
organization of the armed forces, which provided for universal
military service and anticipated a vastly expanded German army
(<span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>, 1935, I, p. 369) (<span class='it'>1654-PS</span>). This was described
by Keitel as the real start of the large-scale rearmament
program which followed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fourth point was the remilitarization of the Rhineland. The
Rhineland was reoccupied on 7 March 1936. This action was announced
by Hitler (<span class='it'>2289-PS</span>), who had also previously given the
order for “Operation Schulung,” directing the military action
which was to be taken if necessary (<span class='it'>C-139</span>). These were acts for
which von Neurath shared responsibility from his position and
from the steps which he took. Some time later he summed up his
views on the actions detailed above in a speech to Germans
abroad, on 29 August 1937:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The unity of the racial and national will created through
Nazism with unprecedented elan has made possible a foreign
policy through which the bonds of the Versailles Treaty were
slashed, freedom to arm regained, and the sovereignty of
the whole nation reestablished. We have again become master
in our own home, and we have produced the means of
power to remain henceforth that way for all times. The
world should notice from Hitler’s deeds and words that his
aims are not aggressive war.” (<span class='it'>D-449</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='1020' id='Page_1020'></span></p>

<h3>D. <span class='it'>VON NEURATH’S PART, AS FOREIGN MINISTER AND ADVISOR TO THE FUEHRER, IN THE PLANNING OF WARS OF AGGRESSION.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Both as Minister of Foreign Affairs and as one of the inner
circle of the Fuehrer’s advisors on foreign political matters, von
Neurath participated in the political planning and preparation
for acts of aggression against Austria, Czechoslovakia, and other
nations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>The von Neurath technique.</span> If von Neurath’s policy may
be described in a sentence it may be summarized as breaking one
treaty only at a time. He himself put it slightly more pompously
but to the same effect in a speech before the Academy of German
Law on 30 October 1937:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * Out of the acknowledgment of these elementary
facts the Reich Cabinet has always interceded in favor of
treating every concrete international problem within methods
especially suited for it, not to complicate it unnecessarily by
amalgamation with other problems, and as long as problems
between only two powers are concerned to choose the way
for an immediate understanding between these two powers.
We are in a position to state that this method has fully
proved itself good not only in the German interest, but also
in the general interest.” (<span class='it'>D-471</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The only countries whose interests von Neurath failed to mention
in that speech are the other parties to the various treaties
that were dealt with in that way. The working out of that policy
can be seen from a brief summary of the actions of von Neurath
when he was Foreign Minister, and those of his immediate successor
when von Neurath still purported to have influence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1935 action was directed against the Western Powers, in
the form of the rearmament of Germany. When that was going
on another country had to be reassured. At that time it was
Austria, which still had—up to 1935—the support of Italy. Hence,
the fraudulent and clearly false assurance, the essence of the
technique in that case, given by Hitler, on 21 May 1935. (<span class='it'>TC-26</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, in 1936, action was again taken against the Western
Powers in the occupation of the Rhineland. Another fraudulent
assurance was made to Austria in the Treaty of 11 July of that
year, (<span class='it'>TC-22</span>) the deceitful nature of which is shown by letters
from von Papen. (<span class='it'>2246-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2247-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, in 1937 and 1938, the Nazis moved on a step and action
was directed against Austria. That action was absorption, finally
planned, at the latest, at the meeting on 5 November 1937 (<span class='it'>386-PS</span>).
<span class='pageno' title='1021' id='Page_1021'></span>
The action was taken on 11 March 1938. Reassurance had
to be given to the Western Powers; hence the assurance to Belgium
on 13 October 1937. (<span class='it'>TC-34</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Less than a year later the object of the aggressive action was
Czechoslovakia. The Sudetenland was obtained in September
1938, and the whole of Bohemia and Moravia was absorbed on
15 March 1939. At that time it was necessary to reassure Poland;
so an assurance to Poland was given by Hitler oh 20 February
1938 (<span class='it'>2357-PS</span>), and repeated up to 26 September 1938 (<span class='it'>2358-PS</span>).
The falsity of that assurance is shown in Section 8 of Chapter
IX on Aggression Against Poland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, when the Nazis decided to take action for the conquest
of Poland in the next year, assurance had to be given to Russia.
Hence, a non-aggression pact was entered into with the U.S.S.R.
on 23 August 1939. (<span class='it'>TC-25</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>With regard to the foregoing summary, the Latin tag, <span class='it'>res ipsa
loquitur</span> is apposite. But a frank statement from von Neurath
with regard to the earlier part of it is found in the account of his
conversation with the United States Ambassador, Mr. Bullitt, on
18 May 1936 (<span class='it'>L-150</span>):</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Von Neurath said that it was the policy of the German
Government to do nothing active in foreign affairs until ‘the
Rhineland had been digested.’ He explained that he meant
that, until the German fortifications had been constructed on
the French and Belgian frontiers, the German Government
would do everything possible to prevent rather than encourage
an outbreak by the Nazis in Austria and would pursue
a quiet line with regard to Czechoslovakia. ‘As soon as our
fortifications are constructed and the countries of Central
Europe realize that France cannot enter German territory
at will, all those countries will begin to feel very differently
about their foreign policies and a new constellation will develop,’
he said.” (<span class='it'>L-150</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The conversation between von Papen as Ambassador and Mr.
Messersmith is much to the same effect. (<span class='it'>1760-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Austria.</span> At the time of the aggression against Austria von
Neurath was Foreign Minister. This included the preliminary
stages, during the early Nazi plottings against Austria in 1934.
In this period occurred the Nazi murder of Chancellor Dolfuss
and the ancillary acts which were afterwards so strongly approved
by the German Government. (See Section 3 of Chapter
IX on Aggression Against Austria.) Von Neurath was also Foreign
Minister when the false assurance was given to Austria on
<span class='pageno' title='1022' id='Page_1022'></span>
21 May 1935 (<span class='it'>TC-26</span>) and the fraudulent treaty was made on 11
July 1936 (<span class='it'>TC-22</span>). And von Neurath was Foreign Minister when
his ambassador to Austria, von Papen, was carrying on his subterranean
intrigue in the period from 1935 to 1937. (<span class='it'>2247-PS</span>;
<span class='it'>2246-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Von Neurath was present when Hitler declared, in a highly
confidential circle, on 5 November 1937, that the German question
could only be solved by force, and that his plans were to conquer
Austria and Czechoslovakia (<span class='it'>386-PS</span>). Hitler expressed his designs
on Austria as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * For the improvement of our military political position,
it must be our first aim in every case of entanglement
by war to conquer Czechoslovakia and Austria simultaneously,
in order to remove any threat from the flanks in case
of a possible advance westwards.” (<span class='it'>386-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>It is impossible for von Neurath, after that meeting, to say that
he was not acting except with his eyes completely open and with
complete comprehension as to what was intended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the <span class='it'>Anschluss</span> von Neurath received a note from the
British Ambassador dated 11 March 1938 (<span class='it'>3045-PS</span>). In reply
von Neurath uttered two obvious untruths. The first:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“* * * It is untrue that the Reich used forceful pressure
to bring about this development, especially the assertion,
which was spread later by the former Chancellor Schuschnigg,
that the German Government had presented the Federal
President with a conditional ultimatum. It is a pure invention.”
(<span class='it'>3287-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>According to the German ultimatum, Schuschnigg had to appoint
a proposed candidate as Chancellor and form a Cabinet conforming
to the proposals of the German Government. Otherwise the
invasion of Austria by German troops was held in prospect. (See
Section 3 of Chapter IX on Aggression Against Austria.) The
second untruth:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The truth of the matter is that the question of sending
military or police forces from the Reich was only brought
up when the newly formed Austrian Cabinet addressed a
telegram, already published by the press, to the German Government,
urgently asking for the dispatch of German troops
as soon as possible, in order to restore peace and order and
to avoid bloodshed. Faced with the immediately threatening
danger of a bloody civil war in Austria the German Government
then decided to comply with the appeal addressed to
it.” (<span class='it'>3287-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='1023' id='Page_1023'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>(As to the inspired nature of the Austrian telegram, see Section
3 of Chapter IX on Aggression Against Austria.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>All that can be said is that it must have given von Neurath a
certain macabre sort of humor to write that note (<span class='it'>3287-PS</span>)
when the truth was the opposite, as shown by the report of
Gauleiter Rainer to Buerckel (<span class='it'>812-PS</span>), the transcripts of Goering’s
telephone conversations with Austria (<span class='it'>2949-PS</span>), and the
entries in Jodl’s diary for 11, 13, and 14 February. (<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to Jodl’s diary—the entry for 10 March:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“At 13.00 hours General Keitel informs Chief of Operational
Staff and Admiral Canaris. Ribbentrop is being detained
in London. Neurath takes over the Foreign Office.”
(<span class='it'>1780-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>It is inconceivable when von Neurath had taken over the Foreign
Office, was dealing with the matter and was co-operating with
Goering to suit the susceptibilities of the Czechs, that he should
have been so ignorant of the truth of events as to write that letter
(<span class='it'>3287-PS</span>) in good faith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Von Neurath’s position is shown equally clearly by the account
which is given of him in the affidavit of Messersmith (<span class='it'>2385-PS</span>).
Von Neurath’s style of activity at this crisis is described as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I should emphasize here in this statement that the men
who made these promises were not only the dyed-in-the-wool
Nazis, but more conservative Germans who already had begun
to willingly lend themselves to the Nazi program.</p>

<p>“In an official dispatch to the Department of State from
Vienna, dated October 10, 1935, I wrote as follows:</p>

<p>“ ‘Europe will not get away from the myth that Neurath,
Papen, and Mackensen are not dangerous people and that
they are diplomats of the old school. They are in fact servile
instruments of the regime, and just because the outside
world looks upon them as harmless they are able to work
more effectively. They are able to sow discord just because
they propagate the myth that they are not in sympathy with
the regime’.” (<span class='it'>2385-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Czechoslovakia.</span> At the time of the occupation of Austria,
von Neurath gave the assurance to M. Mastny, the Ambassador
of Czechoslovakia to Berlin, regarding the continued independence
of Czechoslovakia (<span class='it'>TC-27</span>). M. Jan Masaryk, Czechoslovakian
Foreign Minister, describes the circumstances as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“I have in consequence been instructed by my Government
to bring to the official knowledge of His Majesty’s Government
<span class='pageno' title='1024' id='Page_1024'></span>
the following facts: Yesterday evening (the 11th
March) Field-Marshal Goering made two separate statements
to M. Mastny, the Czechoslovak Minister in Berlin,
assuring him that the developments in Austria will in no
way have any detrimental influence on the relations between
the German Reich and Czechoslovakia, and emphasizing the
continued earnest endeavor on the part of Germany to improve
those mutual relations.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“M. Mastny was in a position to give him [Goering] definite
and binding assurances on this subject [Czech mobilization]
and today spoke with Baron von Neurath, who, among other
things, assured him on behalf of Herr Hitler that Germany
still considers herself bound by the German-Czechoslovak
Arbitration Convention concluded at Locarno in October
1925.” (<span class='it'>TC-27</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>In view of von Neurath’s presence at the meeting on 5 November
1937, four months previously, where he had heard Hitler’s views
on Czechoslovakia (<span class='it'>386-PS</span>), and that it was only six months before
the treaty was disregarded, von Neurath’s assurance is an
excellent example of the technique of diplomacy developed by von
Neurath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 28 May 1938 Hitler held a conference of important leaders,
including Beck, von Brauchitsch, Raeder, Keitel, Goering, and
Ribbentrop, at which Hitler affirmed that preparations should be
made for military action against Czechoslovakia by October
(<span class='it'>388-PS</span>; <span class='it'>2360-PS</span>). It is believed, although not confirmed, that
von Neurath attended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 4 September 1938 the Government of which von Neurath
was a member enacted a new Secret Reich Defense Law which
defined various official responsibilities, in clear anticipation of
war. This law provided, as did the previous Secret Reich Defense
Law, for a Reich Defense Council as a supreme policy board
for war preparations (<span class='it'>2194-PS</span>). Then came the Munich agreement
of 29 September 1938, in spite of which, on 14 March 1939,
German troops marched into Czechoslovakia. (<span class='it'>TC-50</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 16 March 1939 the German Government, of which von Neurath
was still a member, promulgated the Decree of the Fuehrer
and Reich Chancellor on the Establishment of the Protectorate
of Bohemia and Moravia. (<span class='it'>TC-51</span>) During the following week,
von Ribbentrop signed a treaty with Slovakia (<span class='it'>1439-PS</span>), Article
2 of which reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“For the purpose of making effective the protection undertaken
by the German Reich, the German armed forces shall
<span class='pageno' title='1025' id='Page_1025'></span>
have the right at all times to construct military installations
and to keep them garrisoned in the strength they deem necessary,
in an area delimited on its western side by the frontiers
of the State of Slovakia, and on its eastern side by a
line formed by the eastern rims of the Lower Carpathians,
the White Carpathians, and the Javornik Mountains.</p>

<p>“The Government of Slovakia will take the necessary steps
to assure that the land required for these installations shall
be conveyed to the German armed forces. Furthermore, the
Government of Slovakia will agree to grant exemption from
custom duties for imports from the Reich for the maintenance
of the German troops and the supply of military installations.”
(<span class='it'>1439-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The ultimate objective of Hitler’s policies, disclosed at the meeting
at which von Neurath was present on 5 November 1937
(<span class='it'>386-PS</span>), is obvious from the terms of this treaty. It was the
resumption of the <span class='it'>drang</span> for <span class='it'>lebensraum</span> in the East.</p>

<h3>E. <span class='it'>VON NEURATH’S PART, AS PROTECTOR FOR BOHEMIA AND MORAVIA, IN THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT WAR CRIMES AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>By accepting and occupying the position of Reich Protector of
Bohemia and Moravia, von Neurath personally adhered to the
aggression against Czechoslovakia. As Protector he further actively
participated in the conspiracy for world aggression, and
assumed a position of leadership in the execution of policies involving
violations of the laws of war and the commission of
crimes against humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Von Neurath’s responsibility for these crimes derives from the
legal position which he assumed. Von Neurath assumed the position
of Protector under a sweeping grant of powers. Article V
of the act creating the Protectorate provided:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“1. As trustee of Reich interests, the Leader and Chancellor
of the Reich shall nominate a Reich Protector in Bohemia
and Moravia. His seat of office will be Prague.</p>

<p>“2. The Reich Protector, as representative of the Leader and
Chancellor of the Reich and as Commissioner of the Reich
Government, is charged with the duty of seeing to the observance
of the political principles laid down by the Leader and
Chancellor of the Reich.</p>

<p>“3. The members of the Government of the Protectorate
shall be confirmed by the Reich Protector. The confirmation
may be withdrawn.
<span class='pageno' title='1026' id='Page_1026'></span></p>

<p>“4. The Reich Protector is entitled to inform himself of all
measures taken by the Government of the protectorate and
to give advice. He can object to measures calculated to harm
the Reich and, in case of danger, issue ordinances required
for the common interest.</p>

<p>“5. The promulgation of laws, ordinances and other legal announcements
and the execution of administrative measures
and legal judgments shall be annulled if the Reich Protector
enters an objection.” (<span class='it'>2119-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At the very outset of the Protectorate, von Neurath’s supreme
authority was implemented by a series of basic decrees. These
established the alleged legal foundation for the policy and program
which resulted, all aimed toward the systematic destruction
of the national integrity of the Czechs. Among these decrees
were:</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) The decree granting “Racial Germans” in Czechoslovakia
a supreme order of citizenship (<span class='it'>2119-PS</span>);</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) An act concerning the representation in the Reichstag of
Greater Germany of German Nationals Resident in the Protectorate
(13 April 1939);</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) An order concerning the acquisition of German citizenship
by former Czechoslovakian citizens of German origin (20 April
1939).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another series of decrees granted “Racial Germans” in Czechoslovakia
a preferred status at law and in the courts:</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) An order concerning the Exercise of Criminal Jurisdiction
in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (14 April 1939);</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) An order concerning the Exercise of Jurisdiction in Civil
Proceedings (14 April 1939);</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) An order concerning the Exercise of Military Jurisdiction
(8 May 1939).</p>

<p class='noindent'>The Ordinance on Legislation in the Protectorate (7 June 1939)
also granted to the Protector broad powers to change by decree
the autonomous law of the Protectorate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, the Protector was authorized, with the Reich Leader
SS and the Chief of the German Police (Himmler) “to take, if
necessary, such (police) measures which go beyond the limits
usually valid for police measures.” It is difficult to imagine what
can be police measures “beyond the limits usually valid for police
measures” in view of the police measures in Germany between
1933 and 1939. (See Section 4 of Chapter VII on Purge of Political
Opponents and Section 6 of Chapter XV on the Gestapo
and SD.) But presumably such increase was believed to be possible,
<span class='pageno' title='1027' id='Page_1027'></span>
and was given to von Neurath to use for coercion of the
Czechs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The declared basic policy of the Protectorate was to destroy
the identity of the Czechs as a nation and to absorb their territory
into the Reich. This is borne out by a memorandum signed by
Lt. Gen. of Infantry Frederici (<span class='it'>862-PS</span>), which is headed “The
Deputy General of the Armed Forces with the Reich Protector in
Bohemia and Moravia”. It is marked Top Secret and dated 15
October 1940. That was practically a year before von Neurath
went on leave, as he puts it, on 27 September 1941. The memorandum
discusses “Basic Political Principles in the Protectorate,”
and copies went to Keitel and Jodl. The memorandum states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“On 9 October of this year [1940] the office of the Reich protector
held an official conference in which State Secretary SS
Lt. General K. H. Frank spoke about the following:</p>

<p>“Since creation of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia,
party agencies, industrial circles, as well as agencies of the
central authorities of Berlin, have had difficulties about the
solution of the Czech problem.</p>

<p>“After ample deliberation, the Reich Protector expressed his
view about the various plans in a memorandum. In this,
three ways of solution were indicated:</p>

<p>“A. German infiltration of Moravia and <span class='it'>reduction of the
Czech nationality to a residual Bohemia</span>.</p>

<p>“This solution is considered as unsatisfactory, because the
Czech problem, even if in a diminished form, will continue
to exist.</p>

<p>“B. Many arguments can be brought up against the most
radical solution, namely, the deportation of all Czechs.
Therefore the memorandum comes to the conclusion that it
can not be carried out within a reasonable space of time.</p>

<p>“C. Assimilation of the Czechs, i.e. absorption of about half
of the Czech nationality by the Germans, insofar as this is of
importance by being valuable from a racial or other standpoint.
This will take place among other things, also by increasing
the <span class='it'>Arbeitseinsatz</span> of the Czechs in the Reich territory,
with the exception of the Sudeten German border district;
in other words, by dispersing the closed Czech nationality.
The other half of the Czech nationality must be deprived
of its power, eliminated and shipped out of the country
by all sorts of methods. This applies particularly to the
racially mongoloid part, and to the major part of the intellectual
class. The latter can scarcely be converted ideologically,
<span class='pageno' title='1028' id='Page_1028'></span>
and would represent a burden by constantly making
claims for leadership over the other Czech classes, and thus
interfering with a rapid assimilation.</p>

<p>“Elements which counteract the planned Germanization are
to be handled roughly and should be eliminated.</p>

<p>“The above development naturally presupposes an increased
influx of Germans from the Reich territory into the Protectorate.</p>

<p>“After a discussion, the Fuehrer has chosen Solution C (assimilation)
as a directive for the solution of the Czech problem,
and decided that, while keeping up the autonomy of the
Protectorate on the surface, the Germanization will have to
be carried out in a centralized way by the office of the Reich
Protector for years to come. From the above no particular
conclusions are drawn by the Armed Forces. This is the direction
which has always been represented from here.</p>

<p>“In this connection, I refer to my memorandum which was
sent to the Chief of the Supreme Command of the Armed
Forces, dated 12 July 1939, entitled ‘The Czech Problem’.”
(<span class='it'>862-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>That view of the Reich Protector was accepted and formed a basis
of his policy. The result was a program of consolidating German
control over Bohemia and Moravia by the systematic oppression
of the Czechs through the abolishment of civil liberties, and the
systematic undermining of the native political, economic, and cultural
structure by a regime of terror. The only protection given
by von Neurath was a protection to the perpetrators of innumerable
crimes against the Czechs. (Proof of this aspect of von Neurath’s
responsibility was left for development by the Soviet prosecuting
staff.)</p>

<h3>F. <span class='it'>CONCLUSION.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Von Neurath received many honors and rewards as his worth.
It even appears that Hitler showered more honors on von Neurath
than on some of the leading Nazis who had been with the
Party since the very beginning. His appointments as President
of the newly created Secret Cabinet Council in 1938 was in itself
a new and singular distinction. On 22 September 1940 Hitler
awarded him the War Merit Cross, First Class, as Reich Protector
for Bohemia and Moravia. He was also awarded the Golden Badge
of the Party, and was promoted by Hitler personally from the
rank of <span class='it'>Gruppenfuehrer</span> to <span class='it'>Obergruppenfuehrer</span> in the SS, on 21
June 1943. Von Neurath and Ribbentrop were the only two Germans
<span class='pageno' title='1029' id='Page_1029'></span>
to be awarded the <span class='it'>Adlerorden</span>, a distinction normally reserved
for foreigners. Von Neurath’s seventieth birthday, 2 February
1943, was made the occasion for most of the German newspapers
to praise his many years of service to the Nazi regime.
This service, in the view of the prosecution, may be summed up
in two ways:</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) He was an internal fifth columnist among Conservative
political circles in Germany. They had been anti-Nazi but were
converted in part by seeing one of themselves, in the person of
von Neurath, wholeheartedly with the Nazis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) His previous reputation as a diplomat made public opinion
abroad slow to believe that he would be a member of a cabinet
which did not stand by its words and assurances. It was most
important for Hitler that his own readiness to break every treaty
or commitment should be concealed as long as possible, and for
this purpose he found in von Neurath his handiest tool.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='pg1035a'>21. HANS FRITZSCHE</h2>

<h3>A. <span class='it'>POSITIONS HELD BY FRITZSCHE IN THE NAZI STATE.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Fritzsche’s Party membership and his various positions in the
propaganda apparatus of the Nazi State are shown in two affidavits
made by himself (<span class='it'>2976-PS</span>; <span class='it'>3469-PS</span>). Fritzsche became
a member of the Nazi Party on 1 May 1933, and continued to be
a member until Germany’s collapse in 1945.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fritzsche began his service with the staff of the Reich Ministry
for People’s Enlightenment and Propaganda (hereinafter referred
to as the Propaganda Ministry) on 1 May 1933, he remained
within the Propaganda Ministry until the Nazi downfall
in the spring of 1945.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the Nazis seized political power in Germany, and beginning
in September 1932, Fritzsche was head of the Wireless News
Service (<span class='it'>Drahtloser Dienst</span>), an agency of the Reich Government,
which at that time was the government of von Papen. After the
Wireless News Service was incorporated into Dr. Goebbels’
Propaganda Ministry in May 1933, Fritzsche continued as its
head until 1938. Upon entering the Progapanda Ministry in May
1933, Fritzsche also became head of the news section of the Press
Division of the Propaganda Ministry. He continued in this position
until 1937. In the summer of 1938 Fritzsche was appointed
deputy to Alfred Ingemar Berndt, who was then head of the German
Press Division. (The German Press Division, in the Indictment,
<span class='pageno' title='1036' id='Page_1036'></span>
is called the “Home Press Division.” Since “German Press
Division” seems to be a more literal translation, it is referred to
as the German Press Division throughout this section. It is sometimes
otherwise known as the Domestic Press Division.) This
Division, as will be later shown, was the major section of the
Press Division of the Reich Cabinet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In December 1938 Fritzsche succeeded Berndt as the head of
the German Press Division. Between 1938 and November 1942,
Fritzsche was promoted three times. He advanced in title from
Superior Government Counsel to Ministerial Counsel, then to
<span class='it'>Ministerialdirigent</span>, and finally to <span class='it'>Ministerialdirektor</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In November 1942 Fritzsche was relieved of his position as
head of the German Press Division by Dr. Goebbels. In its place
he accepted from Dr. Goebbels a newly created position in the
Propaganda Ministry, that of Plenipotentiary for the Political
Organization of the Greater German Radio. At the same time he
also became head of the Radio Division of the Propaganda Ministry.
He held both these positions in radio until the Nazi downfall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are two allegations in the Indictment concerning Fritzsche’s
positions for which no proof is available. The first unsupported
allegation states that Fritzsche was Editor-in-Chief of the
official German News Agency, <span class='it'>Deutsche Nachrichten Buero</span>. The
second unsupported allegation states that Fritzsche was head of
the Radio Division of the Propaganda Department of the Nazi
Party. Fritzsche, in his affidavit, denies having held either of
these positions, and these two allegations must fall for want of
other proof.</p>

<h3>B. <span class='it'>FRITZSCHE’S PART IN THE CONSPIRACY TO CONSOLIDATE NAZI CONTROL OVER GERMANY AND TO LAUNCH WARS OF AGGRESSION.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>In one of his affidavits (<span class='it'>3469-PS</span>), which contains numerous
statements in the nature of self-serving declarations, Fritzsche
states that he first became a successful journalist in the service
of the Hugenberg Press, the most important chain of newspaper
enterprises in pre-Nazi Germany. The Hugenberg concern owned
papers of its own, but it was important primarily because it
served newspapers which principally supported the so-called
“national” parties of the Reich, including the NSDAP.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In paragraph 5 of this affidavit (<span class='it'>3469-PS</span>), Fritzsche relates
that in September 1932, when von Papen was Reich Chancellor,
he was made head of the Wireless News Service, replacing an official
<span class='pageno' title='1037' id='Page_1037'></span>
who was politically unbearable to the Papen regime. The
Wireless News Service was a government agency for spreading
news by radio. Fritzsche began making radio broadcasts at about
this time, with a success which Goebbels recognized and later exploited
on behalf of the Nazi conspirators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the evening of the day when the Nazis seized power, the 30
January 1933, two emissaries from Goebbels visited Fritzsche.
One of them was Dressler-Andrees, head of the Radio Division of
the NSDAP; the other was an assistant of Dressler-Andrees
named Sadila-Mantau. These two emissaries notified Fritzsche
that although Goebbels was angry with Fritzsche for writing an
article critical of Hitler, still Goebbels recognized Fritzsche’s public
success on the radio. They stated further that Goebbels desired
to retain Fritzsche as head of the Wireless News Service on
certain conditions: (1) that Fritzsche discharge all Jews; (2)
that he discharge all other personnel who would not join the
NSDAP; (3) that he employ with the Wireless News Service the
second Goebbels’ emissary, Sadila-Mantau. Fritzsche refused all
these conditions except the hiring of Sadila-Mantau. (<span class='it'>3469-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fritzsche continued to make radio broadcasts during this period
in which he supported the national National Socialist coalition
government then still existing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In early 1933 SA troops several times called at the Wireless
News Service and Fritzsche prevented them, with some difficulty,
from making news broadcasts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In April 1933 Goebbels called Fritzsche to him for a personal
audience. At paragraph 9 of his affidavit (<span class='it'>3469-PS</span>) Fritzsche
has described his prior relationship with Dr. Goebbels:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“I was acquainted with Dr. Goebbels since 1928. Apparently
he had taken a liking to me, besides the fact that in my press
activities I had always treated the National Socialists in a
friendly way until 1931. Already before 1933, Goebbels,
who was the editor of the ‘<span class='it'>Attack</span>’ [“<span class='it'>Der Angriff</span>”] a Nazi
newspaper, had frequently made flattering remarks about
the form and content of my work, which I did as contributor
of many ‘National’ newspapers and periodicals, among which
were also reactionary papers and periodicals.” (<span class='it'>3469-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Establishment of complete Nazi control over press and
radio.</span> At the first Goebbels-Fritzsche discussion in early April
1933, Goebbels informed Fritzsche of his decision to place the
Wireless News Service within the Propaganda Ministry as of
1 May 1933. He suggested that Fritzsche make certain rearrangements
in the personnel so as to remove Jews and other
<span class='pageno' title='1038' id='Page_1038'></span>
persons who did not support the NSDAP. Fritzsche debated
with Goebbels concerning some of these steps. During this
period Fritzsche made some effort to place Jews in other jobs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a second conference with Goebbels shortly thereafter,
Fritzsche informed Goebbels about the steps he had taken in reorganizing
the Wireless News Service. Goebbels thereupon informed
Fritzsche that he would like to have him reorganize and
modernize the entire news services of Germany within the controls
of the Propaganda Ministry. On 17 March 1933, approximately
two months before this time, the Propaganda Ministry
had been created by decree. (<span class='it'>2029-PS</span>) Fritzsche was intrigued
by the Goebbels offer. He proceeded to conclude the Goebbels-inspired
reorganization of the Wireless News Service and, on
1 May 1933, together with the remaining members of his staff,
he joined the Propaganda Ministry. On this same day he joined
the NSDAP and took the customary oath of unconditional loyalty
to the Fuehrer (<span class='it'>3469-PS</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>From this time on, whatever reservations Fritzsche may have
had, either then or later, to the course of events under the Nazis,
Fritzsche was completely within the Nazi camp. For the next 13
years he assisted in creating and in using the propaganda devices
which the conspirators successfully employed in each of the
principal phases of the conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From 1933 until 1942 Fritzsche held one or more positions
within the German Press Division. For four years, from 1938
to 1942—the period when the Nazis undertook military invasions
of neighboring countries—he headed this Division. By virtue of
its functions, the German Press Division became an important
and unique instrument of the Nazi conspirators, not only in dominating
the minds and psychology of Germans, but also as an
instrument of foreign policy and psychological warfare against
other nations. Thus, the already broad jurisdiction of the Propaganda
Ministry was extended as follows by a Hitler decree of
30 June 1933:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The Reich Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda
has jurisdiction over the whole field of spiritual indoctrination
of the nation, of propagandizing the State, of
cultural and economic propaganda, of enlightenment of the
public at home and abroad. Furthermore, he is in charge
of the administration of all institutions serving those purposes.”
(<span class='it'>2030-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>An exposition of the general functions of the German Press
Division of the Propaganda Ministry is contained in an excerpt
from a book by George Wilhelm Mueller, a Ministerial Director
<span class='pageno' title='1039' id='Page_1039'></span>
in the Propaganda Ministry. (<span class='it'>2434-PS</span>) Paragraphs 14, 15 and
16 of Fritzsche’s affidavit contain an exposition of the functions
of the German Press Division, a description which confirms and
adds to the exposition in Mueller’s book. Concerning the German
Press Division, Fritzsche’s affidavit (<span class='it'>3469-PS</span>) states:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“During the whole period from 1933 to 1945 it was the task
of the German Press Division to supervise the entire domestic
press and to provide it with directives by which this
division became an efficient instrument in the hands of the
German State leadership. More than 2,300 German daily
newspapers were subject to this control. The aim of this
supervision and control, in the first years following 1933,
was to change basically the conditions existing in the press
before the seizure of power. That meant the coordination
into the New Order of those newspapers and periodicals
which were in the service of capitalistic special interests or
party politics. While the administrative functions, wherever
possible, were exercised by the professional associations and
the Reich Press Chamber, the political leadership of the
German press was entrusted to the German Press Division.
The head of the German Press Division held daily press
conferences in the Ministry for the representatives of all
German newspapers. Hereby all instructions were given
to the representatives of the press. These instructions were
transmitted daily, almost without exception, and mostly by
telephone, from headquarters by Dr. Otto Dietrich, Reich
Press Chief, in a fixed statement, the so-called ‘Daily Parole
of the Reich Press Chief.’ Before the statement was fixed
the head of the German Press Division submitted to him—Dietrich—the
current press wishes expressed by Dr. Goebbels
and by other Ministries. This was the case especially
with the wishes of the Foreign Office, about which Dr.
Dietrich always wanted to make decisions personally or
through his representatives at the headquarters, Helmut
Suendermann and chief editor Lorenz. The practical use of
the general directions in detail was thus left entirely to the
individual work of the individual editor. Therefore, it is
by no means true that the newspapers and periodicals were
a monopoly of the German Press Division or that essays and
leading articles through it had to be submitted to the Ministry.
Even in war times this happened in exceptional cases
only. The less important newspapers and periodicals which
were not represented at the daily press conferences received
their information in a different way—by providing them
<span class='pageno' title='1040' id='Page_1040'></span>
either with ready-made articles and reports, or with a confidential
printed instruction. The publications of all other
official agencies were directed and coordinated likewise by
the German Press Division. To enable the periodicals to get
acquainted with the daily political problems of newspapers
and to discuss these problems in greater detail, the <span class='it'>Informationskorrespondenz</span>
was issued especially for periodicals.
Later on it was taken over by the Periodical Press Division.
The German Press Division likewise was in charge of pictorial
reporting in so far as it directed the employment of
pictorial reporters at important events. In this way, and
conditioned by the current political situation, the entire German
Press was made a permanent instrument of the Propaganda
Ministry by the German Press Division. Thereby,
the entire German Press was subordinate to the political aims
of the Government. This was exemplified by the timely measuring
and the emphatic presentation of such press polemics
as appeared to be most useful, as shown for instance in the
following themes: the class struggle of the system era; the
leadership principle and the authoritarian state; the party
and interest politics of the system era; the Jewish problem;
the conspiracy of World Jewry; the Bolshevistic danger;
the plutocratic Democracy abroad; the race problem generally;
the church; the economic misery abroad; the foreign
policy; and living space [<span class='it'>lebensraum</span>].” (<span class='it'>3469-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This description of Fritzsche’s establishes clearly that the German
Press Division was the instrument for subordinating the
entire German press to the political aims of the Nazi Government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fritzsche’s early activities within the German Press Division
on behalf of the conspirators are described in his affidavit
(<span class='it'>3469-PS</span>). In a conference with Goebbels the following occurred:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“At this time Dr. Goebbels suggested to me, as a specialist
on news technique, the establishment and direction of a section
‘News,’ within the Press Division of his Ministry, in
order to organize fully and to modernize the German news
agencies. In executing this assignment given to me by Dr.
Goebbels I took for my field the entire news field for the
German Press and the radio in accordance with the directions
given by the Propaganda Ministry, at first with the
exception of the DNB, German News Agency.” (<span class='it'>3469-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The reason why the DNB was excepted from Fritzsche’s field at
this time is that it did not come into existence until 1934.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later on in his affidavit Fritzsche mentions the sizeable funds
<span class='pageno' title='1041' id='Page_1041'></span>
put at his disposal in building up the Nazi news services. Altogether,
the German news agencies received a ten-fold increase
in their budget from the Reich, an increase from 400,000 to
4,000,000 marks. Fritzsche himself selected and employed the
Chief Editor for the Transocean News Agency and also for the

<p class='noindent'>“* * * directions of the Propaganda Ministry which I
had to follow were * * * increase of German news copy

National Socialistic System. * * *” (<span class='it'>3469-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>About the summer of 1934 Funk, then Reich Press Chief,
achieved the fusion of the two most important domestic news
agencies, the Wolff Telegraph Agency and the Telegraph Union,
and thus formed the official German news agency known as
DNB. Although Fritzsche held no position with DNB at any
time, nevertheless as head of the news section of the German
Press Division, Fritzsche’s duties gave him official jurisdiction
over the DNB, which was the official domestic news agency of the
Reich after 1934. Fritzsche admits that he coordinated the work
of the various foreign news agencies</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“within the inland Europe and overseas foreign countries
with each other and in relationship to DNB” (<span class='it'>3469-PS</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The Wireless News Service was headed by Fritzsche from 1930
to 1937. After January 1933 the Wireless News Service was the
official instrument of the Nazi government in spreading news
over the radio. During the same time that Fritzsche headed the
Wireless News Service, he personally made radio broadcasts to
the German people. These broadcasts were naturally subject to
the controls of the Propaganda Ministry and reflected its purposes.
The influence of Fritzsche’s broadcasts to the German
people, during this period of consolidation of control by the
Nazi conspirators, is all the more important since Fritzsche was
concurrently head of the Wireless News Service, and thus in
control of all radio news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Use of propaganda to prepare the way for aggressions</span>.
The use made by the Nazi conspirators of psychological warfare
is well known. Before each major aggression, with some few
exceptions based on expediency, they initiated a press campaign
calculated to weaken their victims and to prepare the German
people psychologically for the attack. They used the press, after
their earlier conquests, as a means for further influencing foreign
<span class='pageno' title='1042' id='Page_1042'></span>
politics and in maneuvering for the next following aggression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the time of the occupation of the Sudetenland on 1 October
1938, Fritzsche had become deputy head of the entire German
Press Division. Fritzsche states that the role of German propaganda
before the Munich Agreement on the Sudetenland was
directed by his immediate chief, Berndt, head of the German
Press Division. Fritzsche describes Berndt’s propaganda as
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“He exaggerated minor events very strongly, used sometimes
old episodes as new—and there even came complaints
from the Sudetenland itself that much of the news reported
by the German press was untrustworthy. As a matter of
fact, after the great foreign political success at Munich in
September 1938, there came a noticeable crisis in confidence
of the German people in the trustworthiness of its press.
This was one reason for the recalling of Berndt, in December
1938 after the conclusion of the Sudeten action and for
my appointment as head of the German Press Division. Beyond
this, Berndt, by his admittedly successful but still
primitive military-like orders to the German Press, had lost
the confidence of the German editors.” (<span class='it'>3469-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Fritzsche was accordingly made head of the German Press Division
in place of Berndt. Between December 1938 and 1942,
Fritzsche, as head of the German Press Division, personally gave
to the representatives of the principal German newspapers the
“daily parole of the Reich Press Chief.” During this period he
was the principal conspirator directly concerned with the manipulations
of the press.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first important foreign aggression after Fritzsche became
head of the German Press Division was the incorporation of
Bohemia and Moravia. Fritzsche describes the propaganda
action surrounding the incorporation of Bohemia and Moravia
as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The action for the incorporation of Bohemia and Moravia,
which took place on 15 March 1939, while I was head of the
German Press Division, was not prepared for such a long
period as the Sudeten action. According to my memory,
it was in February that I received the order from the Reich
Press Chief, Dr. Dietrich, which was repeated as a request
by the envoy Paul Schmidt of the Foreign Office, to bring
the attention of the press to the efforts for independence
of Slovakia and to the continued anti-German coalition
politics of the Prague government. I did this. The daily
<span class='pageno' title='1043' id='Page_1043'></span>
paroles of the Reich Press Chief and the press conference
minutes at that time show the wording of the corresponding
instructions. These were the typical headlines of leading
newspapers and the emphatic leading articles of the German
daily press at that time: (1) the terrorizing of Germans
within the Czech territory by arrest, shooting of Germans
by the state police, destruction and damaging of German
homes by Czech gangsters; (2) the concentration of Czech
forces on the Sudeten frontier; (3) the kidnaping, deporting,
and persecuting of Slovakian minorities by the Czechs; that
the Czechs must get out of Slovakia; (4) secret meetings of
Red functionaries in Prague. Some few days before the
visit of Hacha, I received the instruction to publish in the
press very emphatically the incoming news on the unrest in
Czechoslovakia. Such information I received only partly
from the German News Agency, DNB. Mostly it came from
the Press Division of the Foreign Office and some of it came
from big newspapers with their own news services. Among
the newspapers offering information was above all the ‘<span class='it'>Voelkischer
Beobachter</span>’ which, as I learned later on, received its
information from the SS Standartenfuehrer Gunter D’Alquen.
He was at this time in Pressburg. I had forbidden
all news agencies and newspapers to issue news on unrest
in Czechoslovakia before I had seen it. I wanted to avoid a
repetition of the very annoying results of the Sudeten action
propaganda, and I did not want to suffer a loss of prestige
caused by untrue news. Thus, all news checked by me was
admittedly full of tendency [<span class='it'>voller Tendenz</span>] however, not
invented. After the visit of Hacha in Berlin and after the
beginning of the invasion of the German Army, which took
place on 15 March 1939, the German press had enough material
for describing those events. Historically and politically
the event was justified with the indication that the declaration
of independence of Slovakia had required an interference
and that Hacha with his signature had avoided a
war and had reinstated a thousand-year union between
Bohemia and the Reich.” (<span class='it'>3469-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The propaganda campaign of the press preceding the invasion of
Poland on 1 September 1939 bears again the handiwork of
Fritzsche and his German Press Division. Fritzsche speaks of
the conspirators’ treatment of this episode as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Very complicated and changing was the press and propagandists
treatment in the case of Poland. Under the influence
of the German-Polish agreement, it was generally
<span class='pageno' title='1044' id='Page_1044'></span>
forbidden in the German press for many years to publish
anything on the situation of the German minority in Poland.
This remained also the case when in the Spring of 1939 the
German press was asked to become somewhat more active
as to the problem of Danzig. Also, when the first Polish-English
conversations took place, and when the German
press was instructed to use a sharper tone against Poland,
the question of the German minority still remained in the
background. But during the summer this problem was
picked up again and created immediately a noticeable sharpening
of the situation, namely, each larger German newspaper
had for quite some time an abundance of material on
complaints of the Germans in Poland without the editors
having had a chance to use this material. The German papers,
from the time of the minority discussion at Geneva, still had
correspondents of free collaborators in Kattewitz, Bromberg,
Posen, Thorn, etc. Their material now came forth with a
bound. Concerning this the leading German newspapers,
upon the basis of directions given out in the so-called ‘daily
parole’ brought out the following publicity with great emphasis:
(1) cruelty and terror against Germans and the
extermination of Germans in Poland; (2) forced labor of
thousands of German men and women in Poland; (3)
Poland, land of servitude and disorder; the desertion of
Polish soldiers; the increased inflation in Poland; (4) provocation
of frontier clashes upon direction of the Polish Government;
the Polish lust to conquer; (5) persecution of
Czechs and Ukrainians by Poland. The Polish Press replied
particularly sharply.” (<span class='it'>3469-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The press campaign preceding the invasion of Yugoslavia followed
the conventional pattern. The customary definitions, lies,
incitement, and threats, and the usual attempt to divide and
weaken the victim, are contained in Fritzsche’s description of this
propaganda action:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“During the period immediately preceding the invasion of
Yugoslavia, on the 16th of April 1941, the German press
emphasized by headlines and leading articles the following
topics: (1) the planned persecution of Germans in Yugoslavia,
including the burning down of German villages by
Serbian soldiers; also the confining of Germans in concentration
camps and also the physical mishandling of German-speaking
persons; (2) the arming of Serbian bandits by
the Serbian Government; (3) the incitement of Yugoslavia
by the plutocrats against Germany; (4) the increasing anti-Serbian
<span class='pageno' title='1045' id='Page_1045'></span>
feeling in Croatia; (5) the chaotic economic and
social conditions in Yugoslavia.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Since Germany had a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union,
and because the conspirators wanted the advantage of surprise,
there was no special propaganda campaign immediately preceding
the attack on the U.S.S.R. Fritzsche’s affidavit discusses
the propaganda line which was given the German people in justification
of this aggressive war:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“During the night from the 21st to the 22nd of June 1941,
Ribbentrop called me in for a conference in the Foreign
Office Building at about 5 o’clock in the morning, at which
representatives of the domestic and foreign press were
present. Ribbentrop informed us that the war against the
Soviet Union would start that same day and asked the German
press to present the war against the Soviet Union as a
preventative war for the defense of the Fatherland, as a
war which was forced upon us through the immediate danger
of an attack of the Soviet Union against Germany. The
claim that this was a preventative war was later repeated
by the newspapers which received their instructions from
me during the usual daily parole of the Reich Press Chief.
I, myself, have also given this presentation of the cause of
the war in my regular broadcasts.” (<span class='it'>3469-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Fritzsche, throughout his affidavit, constantly refers to his expert
technical assistance to the apparatus of the Propaganda Ministry.
In 1939, apparently becoming dissatisfied with the efficiency of
the existing facilities of the German Press Division, he established
a new instrument for improving the effectiveness of Nazi
propaganda:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“About the summer of 1939 I established within the German
Press Division a section called ‘Speed-Service.’ * * * At
the start it had the task of checking the correctness of news
from foreign countries. Later on, about the Fall of 1939,
this section also elaborated on collecting materials which
were put at the disposal of the entire German press. For
instance, dates from the British Colonial policy, from
political statements of the British Prime Minister in former
times, descriptions of social distress in hostile countries, etc.
Almost all German newspapers used such material as a basis
for their polemics. Hereby was achieved a great unification
within the fighting front of the German press. The title
‘Speed Service’ was chosen because materials for current
comments were supplied with unusual speed.” (<span class='it'>3469-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Throughout this entire period preceding and including the
<span class='pageno' title='1046' id='Page_1046'></span>
launching of aggressive wars, Fritzsche made regular radio
broadcasts to the German people under the program titles of
“Political Newspaper Review,” “Political and Radio Show,” and
later “Hans Fritzsche Speaks.” His broadcasts naturally reflected
the polemics and the controls of his Ministry and thus
of the conspiracy. Fritzsche, the most eminent member of Goebbels’
propaganda team, helped substantially in making possible,
both within Germany and without, the conspirators’ plans for
aggressive war.</p>

<h3>C. <span class='it'>FRITZSCHE’S USE OF PROPAGANDA TO FURTHER THE CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT ATROCITIES AND EXPLOIT OCCUPIED TERRITORIES.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Fritzsche incited atrocities and encouraged a ruthless occupation
policy. The results of propaganda as a weapon of the
Nazi conspirators reaches into every aspect of this conspiracy,
including the atrocities and ruthless exploitation in occupied
countries. It is likely that many ordinary Germans would never
have participated in or tolerated the atrocities committed
throughout Europe, had they not been conditioned and goaded by
the constant Nazi propaganda. The callousness and zeal of the
people who actually committed the atrocities was in large part
due to the constant and corrosive propaganda of Fritzsche and
his official associates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) <span class='it'>Persecution of the Jews.</span> With respect to Jews, the Department
of Propaganda within the Propaganda Ministry had a
special branch for the “Enlightenment of the German people and
of the world as to the Jewish question, fighting with propagandistic
weapons against enemies of the State and hostile ideologies.”
This quotation is taken from a book written in 1940 by
Ministerial Director Mueller, entitled “The Propaganda Ministry.”
(<span class='it'>2434-PS</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his radio broadcasts Fritzsche took a particularly active
part in this “enlightenment” concerning the Jewish question.
These broadcasts were full of provocative libels against Jews, the
result of which was to inflame Germans to further atrocities
against Jews. Even Streicher, the master Jew-baiter of all time,
could scarcely outdo Fritzsche in some of his anti-Jewish incitements.
Broadcasts by Fritzsche which were monitored and
translated by the British Broadcasting Corporation are quite revealing
(<span class='it'>3064-PS</span>). These radio speeches of Fritzsche were
broadcast during the period 1941-1945, which was a period of
intensified anti-Jewish measures.
<span class='pageno' title='1047' id='Page_1047'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>For instance, in a broadcast on 18 December 1941, Fritzsche
declared:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The fate of Jewry in Europe has turned out as unpleasant
as the Fuehrer predicted in the case of a European war.
After the extension of the war instigated by Jews, this unpleasant
fate may also spread to the New World, for you can
hardly assume that the nations of this New World will
pardon the Jews for the misery of which the nations of the
Old World did not absolve them.” (<span class='it'>3064-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>On 18 March 1941 Fritzsche broadcast as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“But the crown of all wrongly-applied Rooseveltian logics is
the sentence ‘There never was a race and there never will
be a race which can serve the rest of mankind as a master.’
Here too we can only applaud Mr. Roosevelt. Precisely
because there exists no race which can be the master of the
rest of mankind, we Germans have taken the liberty to
break the domination of Jewry and of its capital in Germany,
of Jewry which believed to have inherited the Crown of
secret world domination.” (<span class='it'>3064-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>On 9 October 1941 Fritzsche declared over the radio:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“We know very well that these German victories, unparalleled
in history, have not yet stopped the source of
hatred, which, for a long time, has fed the war mongers
and from which this war originated. The international
Jewish-Democratic Bolshevistic campaign of incitement
against Germany still finds cover in this or that fox’s lair or
rat-hole. We have seen only too frequently how the defeats
suffered by the war mongers only doubled their senseless
and impotent fury.” (<span class='it'>3064-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And on 8 January 1944 Fritzsche broadcast the following:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“It is revealed clearly once more that not a system of Government,
not a young nationalism, not a new and well applied
Socialism brought about this war. The guilty ones are
exclusively the Jews and the Plutocrats. If discussion on
the post-war problems brings this to light so clearly, we welcome
it as a contribution for later discussions and also as a
contribution to the fight we are waging now, for we refuse
to believe that world history will confide its future developments
to those powers which have brought about this war.
This clique of Jews and Plutocrats have invested their money
in armaments and they had to see to it that they would get
their interests and sinking funds; hence they unleashed this
war.” (<span class='it'>3064-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='1048' id='Page_1048'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>Finally, in a broadcast on 13 January 1945, Fritzsche stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“If Jewry provided a link between divergent elements as
Plutocracy and Bolshevism and if Jewry was first able to
work successfully in the Democratic countries in preparing
this war against Germany, it has by now placed itself unreservedly
on the side of Bolshevism which, with its entirely
mistaken slogans of racial freedom against racial hatred,
has created the very conditions the Jewish race requires in
its struggle for domination over other races.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“Not the last result of German resistance on the fronts, so
unexpected to the enemy, is the fruition of a development
which began in the pre-war years, the process of subordinating
British policy to far-reaching Jewish points of view.
It began long before this when Jewish emigrants from Germany
started their war-mongering against us from British
and American soil.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“This whole attempt aiming at the establishment of Jewish
world domination, now increasingly recognizable, has come
to a head at the very moment when the people’s understanding
of their racial origins has been far too much awakened
to promise success to the undertaking.” (<span class='it'>3064-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>All this was designed not only as a justification of prior anti-Jewish
actions, but also as an invitation to further persecution
of the Jews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) <span class='it'>Ruthless treatment of peoples of the USSR.</span> Fritzsche
also incited and encouraged ruthless measures against the peoples
of the USSR.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his regular broadcasts Fritzsche’s incitements against the
peoples of the USSR were often linked to, and were certainly
as inflammatory as, his rantings against the Jews. It is ironic
that his propaganda ascribing atrocities to the peoples of the
USSR are accurate descriptions of some of the many atrocities
committed by the German invaders. Shortly after the invasion
of the USSR in June 1941 Fritzsche broadcast as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“The evidence of letters reaching us from the front, of P. K.
[<span class='it'>Propaganda Kompanie</span>] reporters and soldiers on leave
demonstrates that, in this struggle in the East, not one
political system is pitted against another, not one view of
life is fighting another, but that culture, civilization, and
human decency make a stand against the diabolical principle
of a sub-human world.”
<span class='pageno' title='1049' id='Page_1049'></span></p>

<p>“It was only the Fuehrer’s decision to strike in time that
saved our homeland from the fate of being overrun by those
sub-human creatures, and our men, women, and children
from the unspeakable horror of being their prey.” (<span class='it'>3064-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p>In his broadcast on 10 July 1941 Fritzsche spoke of the alleged
inhuman deeds committed in various areas by the Soviet Union,
and he states that upon seeing the evidence of those deeds one is</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p>“* * * finally to make the holy resolve to give his aid
in the final destruction of those who are capable of such
dastardly acts.”</p>

<p> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“The Bolshevist agitators make no effort to deny that in
towns, thousands, in the villages, hundreds, of corpses of
men, women and children have been found, who had been
either killed or tortured to death. Yet the Bolshevik agitators
allege that this was not done by Soviet Commissars but
by German soldiers. Now we Germans know our soldiers.
No German woman, father, or mother requires proof that
their husband or their son cannot have committed such
atrocious acts.” (<span class='it'>3064-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Evidence to be offered by the Soviet prosecuting staff will prove
that representatives of the Nazi conspirators did not hesitate to
exterminate Soviet soldiers and civilians by scientific mass
methods. The incitements by Fritzsche make him an accomplice
in these crimes. His labeling of the Soviet peoples as members
of a “sub-human world” seeking to “exterminate” the German
people, and similar talk, helped fashion the psychological atmosphere
of unreason and hatred which not only made possible these
atrocities in the East, but made them appear a holy duty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) <span class='it'>Exploitation of occupied territories.</span> Fritzsche encouraged
and glorified the policy of the Nazi conspirators in ruthlessly exploiting
the occupied countries. In his radio broadcast of 9 October
1941 he stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Today we can only say: Blitzkrieg or no—this German
thunderstorm has cleansed the atmosphere of Europe. It is
quite true that the dangers threatening us were eliminated
one after the other with lightning speed; but in these lightning
blows which shattered England’s allies on the Continent,
we saw not a proof of the weakness, but a proof of
the strength and superiority of the Fuehrer’s gift as a statesman
and military leader; a proof of the German peoples’
force; we saw the proof that no opponent can stand up to
the courage, discipline, and readiness for sacrifice displayed
<span class='pageno' title='1050' id='Page_1050'></span>
by the German soldier; and we are particularly grateful for
these lightning, unmatched victories, because—as the Fuehrer
emphasized last Friday—they give us the possibility of
embarking on the organization of Europe and of lifting of
the treasures of this old continent, already now in the middle
of war, without it being necessary for millions and millions
of German soldiers to be on guard, fighting day and night
along this or that threatened frontier; and the possibilities
of this continent are so rich that they suffice for any need
of peace or war.” (<span class='it'>3064-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>In his affidavit, Fritzsche admits having encouraged the exploitation
of foreign countries:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“The utilization of the productive capacity of the occupied
countries for the strengthening of the war potential, I have
openly and gloriously praised, chiefly because the competent
authorities put at my disposal much material, especially on
the voluntary placement of manpower.” (<span class='it'>3469-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>(4) <span class='it'>Control of German radio.</span> In addition to continuing as the
head of the German Press Division until after the conspirators
had begun the last of their aggression, Fritzsche was also the
high commander of the entire German radio system. In November
1942 Goebbels created a new position, that of Plenipotentiary
for the Political Organization of the Greater German Radio, a
position which Fritzsche was the first and the last to hold. In
his affidavit, Fritzsche narrates how the entire German Radio
and Television System was organized under his supervision:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“My office practically represented the high command of
German radio.” (<span class='it'>3469-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As special Plenipotentiary for the Political Organization of
the Greater German Radio, Fritzsche issued orders to all the
Reich propaganda offices by teletype. These were used in conforming
the entire radio apparatus of Germany to the desires of
the conspirators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Goebbels customarily held an eleven o’clock conference with
his closest collaborators within the Propaganda Ministry. When
both Goebbels and his undersecretary, Dr. Naumann, were absent,
Goebbels, after 1943, entrusted Fritzsche with the holding
of this eleven o’clock press conference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Goebbels’ introduction to a book by Fritzsche, called “War
to the War Mongers,” he took occasion to praise Fritzsche’s
broadcasts in this fashion:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'>“Nobody knows better than I how much work is involved in
those broadcasts, how many times they were dictated within
<span class='pageno' title='1051' id='Page_1051'></span>
the last minutes to find some minutes later a willing ear by
the whole nation.” (<span class='it'>3255-PS</span>)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is clear from Goebbels himself that the entire German nation
was prepared to lend willing ears to Fritzsche, after he had
made his reputation on the radio.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rumor passed that Fritzsche was “His Master’s Voice”
(<span class='it'>Die Stimme seines Herren</span>). This is borne out by Fritzsche’s
functions. When Fritzsche spoke on the radio it was plain to the
German people that they were listening to the high command of
the conspirators in this field.</p>

<h3>D. <span class='it'>CONCLUSION.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Fritzsche was not the type of conspirator who signed decrees,
or who sat in the inner councils planning the overall grand
strategy. The function of propaganda is, for the most part,
apart from the field of such planning. The function of a
propaganda agency is somewhat more analogous to an advertising
agency or public relations department, the job of which
is to sell the product and to win the market for the enterprise in
question. Here the enterprise was the Nazi conspiracy. In a conspiracy
which depends upon fraud as a means, the salesmen of the
conspiratorial group are quite as essential and culpable as the
master planners, even though he may not have contributed substantially
to the formulation of all the basic strategy, but rather
concentrated on making the execution of this strategy possible.
In this case, propaganda was a weapon of tremendous importance
to this conspiracy. Furthermore, the leading propagandists were
major accomplices in this conspiracy, and Fritzsche was one of
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Fritzsche entered the Propaganda Ministry, which has
been called the most fabulous “lie factory” of all time, and thus
attached himself to the conspiracy, he did so with more of an open
mind than most of the conspirators who had committed themselves
at an earlier date, before the seizure of power. He was in
a particularly strategic position to observe the frauds committed
upon the German people and the world by the conspirators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1933, before Fritzsche took his Party oath of unconditional
obedience and subservience to the Fuehrer, he had observed at
first hand the operations of the storm troopers and the execution
of Nazi race actions. When, notwithstanding, Fritzsche undertook
to bring all German news agencies within Nazi control, he
learned from the inside, indeed from Goebbels himself, the intrigue
and lies against opposition groups within and without Germany.
<span class='pageno' title='1052' id='Page_1052'></span>
He observed, for example, how opposition journalists, a profession
to which he had previously belonged, were either absorbed or
eliminated. He continued to support the conspiracy. He learned
from day to day the art of intrigue and quackery in the process of
perverting the German nation, and he grew in prestige and influence
as he practiced this art.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fritzsche learned a lesson from his predecessor, Berndt, who
fell from the leadership of the German Press Division partly because
he over-played his hand by blunt and excessive manipulation
of the Sudetenland propaganda. Fritzsche stepped into the
gap caused by the loss of confidence of both the editors and the
German people, and did his job with more skill and subtlety. His
shrewdness and ability to be more assuring and “to find,” as Goebbels
said, “willing ears of the whole nation,”—these things made
him the more useful accomplice of the conspirators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nazi Germany and its press went into war with Fritzsche in
control of all German news, whether by press or radio. In 1942,
when Fritzsche transferred from the field of the press to radio,
he was not removed for bungling, but because Goebbels then
needed his talents most in the field of radio. Fritzsche is not in
the dock as a free journalist but as a propagandist who helped
substantially to tighten the Nazi stranglehold over the German
people, who made the excesses of the conspirators palatable to the
German people, who goaded the German nation to fury and crime
against people they were told by him were sub-human.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without the propaganda apparatus of the Nazi State, the world
would not have suffered the catastrophe of these years, and it is
because of Fritzsche’s role in behalf of the Nazi conspirators, and
their deceitful and barbarous practices, that he is called to account
before the International Military Tribunal.</p>

This volume has no German, Polish, Czech, Russian or other eastern European diacritics,
only French diacritics. As a result, Goering and Fuehrer are spelled without
umlauts throughout.</p>

be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
